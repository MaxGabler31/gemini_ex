Overview
 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on addressing the large and growing unmet need in diseases caused by transthyretin, or TTR, amyloidosis, or ATTR. We seek to treat this well-defined family of diseases by targeting them at their collective source by stabilizing TTR. TTR is a protein that occurs naturally in the form of a tetramer (a molecular structure consisting of four identical subunits, or monomers) and performs multiple beneficial roles, including the transport of essential hormones and vitamins. Over 25 years of research have shown that ATTR is uniformly driven by destabilization of the TTR tetramer, stemming from either specific gene mutations or aging. TTR destabilization drives an irreversible dissociation of the tetramer into monomers, which subsequently aggregate and deposit predominantly in the heart and peripheral nervous system, leading to organ damage, loss of organ function, and eventual death if left untreated. We are building upon our significant mechanistic understanding of ATTR to develop a potentially disease-modifying treatment for this family of diseases.
 
Our product candidate, AG10, is an orally-administered small molecule designed to potently stabilize tetrameric TTR, thereby halting at its outset the series of molecular events that give rise to ATTR. Our approach to the treatment of ATTR is designed to mimic a naturally-occurring variant of the TTR gene (T119M) that is considered a “rescue mutation” because it has been shown to prevent ATTR in individuals carrying pathogenic, or disease-causing, mutations in the TTR gene. We believe this specific binding mode underlies the positive results of our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of AG10. In our Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, AG10 was observed in the highest dose cohort to achieve near-complete stabilization of tetrameric TTR over the dosing period. Our Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with symptomatic ATTR cardiomyopathy demonstrated greater than 90% average TTR stabilization in all actively-treated subjects combined. Treatment with AG10 also significantly increased tetrameric TTR concentrations, a biomarker associated with survival in ATTR cardiomyopathy patients, by 50% and 36% in subjects administered 800 mg or 400 mg twice daily, respectively (both p < 0.0001 vs placebo). AG10 was well-tolerated without drug-related findings of clinical concern in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. Based on these data, we are enrolling patients in a Phase 3 clinical trial of AG10 in patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy and are planning to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of AG10 in patients with ATTR polyneuropathy in 2019. 
 In October 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, granted orphan drug designation to AG10 for the treatment of ATTR. The EMA also granted a product-specific pediatric investigational plan waiver for AG10.
 Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR)
 ATTR represents a significant unmet need, with a comparatively large patient population in the context of genetic diseases with an inadequate current standard of care. ATTR is categorized according to its genetic basis and primary clinical manifestation:
  
• | wild-type ATTR cardiomyopathy, or ATTRwt-CM, which results from an age-related process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mutant ATTR cardiomyopathy, or ATTRm-CM; and
--+---------------------------------------------


• | ATTR polyneuropathy, or ATTR-PN.
--+---------------------------------

 The worldwide prevalence of each disease is approximately 400,000, 40,000, and 10,000, respectively, although we believe the cardiomyopathic forms of the disease are significantly underdiagnosed. 
 All three forms of ATTR are progressive and fatal. ATTRwt-CM and ATTRm-CM patients generally present with symptoms later in life (age 50+) and have median life expectancies of three to five years from diagnosis. ATTR-PN either presents in a patient’s early 30s or later (age 50+), and results in a median life expectancy of five to ten years from diagnosis. Progression of all forms of the disease causes significant morbidity, impacts productivity and quality of life, and creates a significant economic burden due to the costs associated with progressively greater patient needs for supportive care. As the disease progresses, ATTRwt-CM and ATTRm-CM patients become increasingly difficult to medically manage and may require frequent hospitalizations and repeated interventions. ATTR-PN patients experience gradual loss of the ability to walk without assistance, and autonomic nervous system function affecting digestion and blood pressure over time, requiring increasing levels of supportive care.
 2

The population of diagnosed ATTRwt-CM and ATTRm-CM patients is growing due to increasing disease awareness and a shift to an accurate and reliable non-invasive diagnostic approach, which allows cardiologists to use a well-established medical imaging modality and readily available blood tests to diagnose ATTR instead of using the previously required, invasive diagnostic method of heart biopsy. We believe this enables both earlier diagnosis and the identification of previously misdiagnosed patients. Specifically, recent literature suggests that a sizeable proportion (12%-19%) of patients diagnosed with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF, which represents about half of the 6-7 million estimated people with heart failure in the United States alone, may in fact have ATTRwt-CM or ATTRm-CM but in the past have not been diagnosed as such.
 AG10 and our therapeutic hypothesis
 We are developing AG10, an orally-administered, small molecule stabilizer of tetrameric TTR, to treat ATTR at its source. Over the past decade, research has suggested that agents that bind and stabilize TTR, as measured by established ex vivo assays, can lead to improved clinical outcomes. The data supporting this hypothesis include genetic validation and clinical data in both ATTR-PN and ATTR-CM. The concept of tetrameric TTR stabilization as a potentially viable therapeutic approach originated from our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of ATTR and the mechanistic details of a naturally occurring rescue mutation in the TTR gene, known as the T119M mutation, that “super-stabilizes” the tetramer. T119M has been observed to prevent the dissociation of TTR tetramers into monomers; T119M tetramers dissociate approximately 40-fold more slowly than wild-type tetramers in biochemical assays. The increased stability of the T119M variant confers protection against ATTR such that, in individuals who carry a highly penetrant, TTR-destabilizing mutation, co-inheritance of T119M protects them against the development of ATTR. This stabilization hypothesis is further supported by clinical trials performed with another TTR stabilizer, tafamidis, in ATTR-CM as well as diflunisal, another TTR stabilizer that is approved as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, in ATTR-PN.
 Summary of our clinical and preclinical results
 We believe the clinical and preclinical data generated to date by AG10 and other small molecule stabilizers strongly support AG10’s development as a preferred therapeutic to treat ATTR, as outlined below.
  
• | Previous studies of small molecule TTR stabilizers have validated the proposed therapeutic mechanism in both ATTR-CM and ATTR-PN. A Phase 3 study of tafamidis in ATTR-CM patients demonstrated that patients receiving tafamidis had lower all-cause mortality (29.5% vs 42.9%) and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations (0.48 per year vs. 0.70 per year) than patients receiving placebo. While an encouraging result, the high residual morbidity and mortality in the treatment group in that trial suggests the potential for additional benefit.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Both tafamidis and diflunisal have been studied in randomized, Phase 2/3 or 3 clinical trials in ATTR-PN and support the hypothesis that increasing levels of TTR stabilization lead to increasing clinical benefit. Tafamidis, which stabilized approximately 45% of TTR at the 20mg dose tested in ATTR-PN, slowed the progression of disease, although it did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint. Diflunisal, which in our preclinical studies stabilized approximately 75% of TTR at the 250mg twice daily dose tested in ATTR-PN, slowed the progression of disease to a greater degree relative to placebo and met statistical significance on the primary endpoint of the study.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cross-trial comparison of clinical trials suggest that AG10 provides a higher degree of stabilization than tafamidis or diflunisal. In both our Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and Phase 2 clinical trial in ATTRwt-CM and ATTRm-CM patients, we observed greater than 90% average TTR stabilization at steady-state in patients receiving 800 mg of AG10 twice daily.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In our Phase 2 clinical trial, AG10 treatment significantly raised serum TTR concentrations (p < 0.0001 vs placebo), a biomarker associated with increased survival in ATTR-CM patients, by 50% and 36% in subjects administered 800 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, respectively, at Day 28. All AG10-treated patients had tetrameric TTR levels in the normal clinical range at Day 28. As a comparison, ATTRwt-CM patients treated with tafamidis at 20 mg daily saw an increase in serum TTR concentrations of 17% at Day 28. Given that increased serum TTR levels are associated with reduced mortality in ATTRwt-CM patients, the observation of a greater effect in AG10-treated patients may predict a larger long-term clinical benefit.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AG10 was well-tolerated without any drug-related safety findings of clinical concern in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. In our Phase 2 clinical trial, AG10 was well tolerated in symptomatic ATTRwt-CM and ATTRm-CM patients receiving 400 mg or 800 mg twice daily for 28 days. In our preclinical studies, AG10 exhibited a greater than 50-fold therapeutic window between its target therapeutic blood level and those concentrations associated with observed, dose-limiting animal toxicity. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | We believe AG10’s comparatively higher TTR stabilization is attributable to advantages in AG10’s binding mode, specificity for binding to TTR relative to other plasma proteins and ability to stabilize a wide range of TTR variants.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Binding mode: X-ray crystallography demonstrates that AG10 uniquely drives hydrogen bonding at the bottom of the thyroxine binding pocket of the TTR molecule to help hold tetrameric TTR together, mimicking the binding mode of the naturally-occurring T119M rescue mutation. To our knowledge, AG10 is the only TTR stabilizer in clinical development or clinical use that has been observed to mimic this super-stabilizing mechanism of the naturally-occurring rescue mutation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | TTR specificity: Our preclinical studies support that AG10’s binding to TTR may be highly specific and not significantly affected by the presence of additional plasma proteins. The free fraction observed for AG10 was 3.6% in our preclinical studies. In contrast, published regulatory documents support that tafamidis also binds to the highly abundant plasma protein albumin, which competes with tafamidis’ ability to bind and stabilize TTR. The free fraction observed for tafamidis was less than 0.5% from the reported literature.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | TTR mutant binding: In our preclinical studies, 10 µM AG10 also resulted in greater than 85% TTR stabilization across a range of mutations that lead to ATTRm-CM or ATTR-PN, which represent over 70% of all patients with mutation-driven ATTR.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Based on these data, we met with the FDA including in an End of Phase 2 meeting in November 2018 and have begun enrolling patients in a Phase 3 clinical trial of AG10 in ATTR-CM patients (ATTRibute-CM). We plan to initiate a second Phase 3 clinical trial of AG10 in ATTR-PN patients (ATTRibute-PN) in 2019.
 We have developed multiple tablet formulations for AG10 and have produced over 200 kg of AG10 conforming with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, manufacturing requirements. 
 We are developing AG10 to treat ATTR in the clinical trials shown in the table below.
 
 
Indication | Worldwideprevalence | Stage | Endpoint and biomarkers 
-----------+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ATTR-CM | 400,000(ATTRwt-CM) 40,000(ATTRm-CM) | Phase 3 ongoing | Change in six-minute walk distance (6MWD); mortality; cardiovascular hospitalizations; safety and tolerability; 
 | Phase 2 open label extension (OLE) ongoing | Safety and tolerability; TTR stabilization; key cardiac biomarkers | 
ATTR-PN | 10,000 | Phase 3 initiation anticipated in 2019 | Neuropathy impairment score (mNIS+7); Safety and tolerability; Norfolk quality of life score; pharmacokinetics; TTR stabilization

 
Our strategy
 Our goal is to be a leader in developing and commercializing disease-modifying therapeutics to treat ATTR. The key components of our strategy are to:
  
• | Rapidly develop AG10 for the treatment of ATTR-CM. We have completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of AG10 in healthy volunteers and in symptomatic ATTR-CM patients, respectively. AG10 was well tolerated in both trials and, at 800 mg twice daily, achieved near-complete stabilization of TTR over the entire dosing interval. In our Phase 2 clinical trial, AG10 treatment also significantly raised serum TTR concentrations (p < 0.0001 vs placebo), a biomarker associated with survival in ATTR-CM patients, by 50% and 36% in subjects administered 800 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, respectively, at Day 28. Based on these data, we are currently enrolling a Phase 3 clinical trial of AG10 in ATTR-CM patients (ATTRibute-CM). ATTRibute-CM is planned to enroll approximately 510 subjects with symptomatic ATTR-CM, including both wild-type and mutant TTR carriers. In Part A, change in 6MWD at 12 months will be compared between treatment and placebo groups as a potential registrational endpoint. In Part B, the study will continue for a total duration of 30 months, at which point all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations will be compared between treatment and control groups.

• | Advance AG10 for the treatment of ATTR-PN. ATTR-PN is caused by the destabilization of tetrameric TTR and deposition of TTR amyloid in the peripheral nervous system. Based on our preclinical and preliminary clinical observations that AG10 potently stabilizes TTR in human serum (at blood levels roughly equal to the level of available TTR binding sites), we also plan to develop AG10 for ATTR-PN. Subject to authorization from applicable regulatory authorities, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical development program for AG10 in ATTR-PN in 2019. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our leadership role in the ATTR community. We have established strong relationships with academics, clinical investigators, and patient advocacy groups in the ATTR field. Working closely with these key stakeholders, we aim to advance the understanding of ATTR in terms of its epidemiology, diagnosis, natural history, and treatment. Further, we plan to support clinical scientific conferences, diagnostic method and other training programs, patient and family advocacy and support organizations, and community-wide advances to increase awareness of this family of diseases among physicians and patients. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Retain development and commercialization rights to AG10 in core strategic markets. We plan to develop and commercialize AG10 in major markets. We believe we can devise time- and cost-efficient strategies to develop, and to obtain regulatory approvals for, novel product candidates such as AG10. We have assembled an experienced team with a successful track record in pharmaceutical development, regulatory strategy and execution of global clinical trials. Given the concentrated market and increasing levels of disease awareness, we intend to establish a small and focused sales force targeting key cardiology and neurology specialists in major markets, and we may evaluate opportunities to establish strategic partnerships in additional markets. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Evaluate opportunities to expand the scope of our development candidate portfolio. We may also form collaborative alliances to expand our capabilities and development opportunities into new therapeutic areas and potentially accelerate commercialization in select geographic markets. Consistent with our strategy and that of our parent company, BridgeBio, we may in-license or acquire additional assets targeting well-defined inherited diseases at their source that complement our primary focus on ATTR. While complementary approaches to the treatment of ATTR are the most synergistic opportunity, building on our deep understanding of ATTR, we may also pursue additional research and development opportunities as well as the acquisition or in-licensing of adjacent precision cardiovascular medicine assets.

 ATTR background and disease pathology
 ATTR is a progressive, fatal disease caused by the accumulation of amyloid fibrils in vital organs as a result of the destabilization of TTR. TTR is named for its role in the transport of thyroxine (thyroid hormone) and retinol (vitamin A). Beyond its activity as a transport protein, multiple lines of evidence point to a larger role of TTR in human physiology. First, TTR is highly conserved evolutionarily and is present in all vertebrates and many invertebrates. In humans, no mutations resulting in reduced or complete elimination of TTR have been described. In a 2013 study of over 68,000 participants in Denmark over an average 32 years of clinical follow-up, the naturally-occurring T119M mutation led to higher circulating TTR concentrations, protection against a range of cerebrovascular events, especially fatal or debilitating stroke, and a 5-10 year increase in life expectancy relative to the general population. In contrast to these beneficial effects, the destabilization of TTR can lead to ATTR. With an estimated prevalence of over 450,000 patients worldwide, ATTR is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases, although each of its clinical forms is currently considered to be an orphan disease indication.
 TTR circulates as a tetramer containing two thyroxine binding sites; TTR monomers do not bind these ligands by themselves. ATTR can result from either defects in protein handling associated with aging (driving wild-type ATTR) or genetic mutations (mutant ATTR), which destabilize TTR and drive its dissociation into TTR monomers. The monomers subsequently aggregate into complexes that are deposited in tissues, including the heart and peripheral nerves. Left untreated, these deposits can cause severe organ damage, loss of organ function and eventual death. Clinically, ATTR primarily presents as either a cardiomyopathy, or ATTR-CM, a form of heart failure, or as a peripheral polyneuropathy, or ATTR-PN, a neurodegenerative disease.
 ATTR-CM is an infiltrative, restrictive cardiomyopathy characterized by progressive right and left heart failure, initially with preserved ejection fraction. Patients suffering from ATTR-CM generally become symptomatic at age 50 or older. Patients with ATTR-CM experience typical symptoms of heart failure, which may include persistent fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, edema (swelling of the legs), and a disproportionate age-related incidence of atrial fibrillation with its associated risk of stroke. As the disease progresses, patients often require frequent hospitalization due to decompensated congestive heart failure. ATTR-CM patients are challenging to medically manage, as commonly used treatments for other forms of heart failure, like ACE inhibitors and beta blockers, can be ineffective or harmful due to the specific effects of ATTR-CM on the ability of the heart to relax and fill with 
 5

fresh blood between heartbeats, and the frequent involvement of the heart’s electrical conduction system and autonomic control of blood pressure, all affecting patients’ ability to maintain cardiac output. As a result, ATTR-CM patients also have a high associated risk of developing both heart block and atrial fibrillation, requiring permanent pacemaker and anticoagulant therapy to prevent stroke, respectively.
 ATTR-CM can develop in older patients in whom TTR is destabilized as part of the natural aging process, a condition known as ATTRwt-CM. ATTR-CM can also be caused by genetic mutations that destabilize TTR, known as ATTRm-CM. ATTRm-CM may have an earlier age of onset and progress more rapidly than ATTRwt-CM. The Transthyretin Cardiac Amyloidosis Study published in 2012 found that the median survival from diagnosis for ATTRwt-CM and ATTRm-CM patients was 43 months and 26 months, respectively.
 The numbers of diagnosed ATTRwt-CM and ATTRm-CM patients are estimated to be 400,000 and 40,000 worldwide, respectively. We believe both forms of ATTR-CM are under-diagnosed due to limited disease awareness and historical reliance on invasive diagnostic techniques. Until recently, a cardiac biopsy was required to make the definitive diagnosis of ATTR-CM. However, non-invasive nuclear medicine imaging agents (technetium-labelled pyrophosphate or bis-phosphonates), coupled with blood tests, have demonstrated the ability to detect ATTR-CM with 99% sensitivity and specificity. These imaging agents allow physicians suspecting ATTR-CM to readily diagnose it in patients without the need for a heart biopsy. In addition, we believe the development of new potential treatments for ATTR has also raised awareness of ATTR amongst physicians, prompting them to consider the diagnosis when evaluating patients with an initial recognition of heart failure, especially HFpEF. These two factors have the potential to lead to broader adoption of a noninvasive diagnostic algorithm and earlier identification of the disease. We are actively supporting efforts to establish training and certification in the use of the noninvasive algorithm with key opinion leaders. Recent clinical reports have suggested significant prevalence of ATTR-CM in multiple cardiac disease and other populations. For example, ATTR-CM has been detected in an important proportion of patients suffering from associated conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, and as a comorbid condition in patients with aortic stenosis or those presenting for hip and knee replacement surgery.
 There are over 140 known pathogenic mutations in the TTR gene that can lead to destabilization of the tetramer, driving ATTRm-CM. The most prevalent TTR mutation in the United States, V122I, is associated with an increased risk of developing ATTRm-CM. The V122I mutation is present in approximately 3.4% of African Americans and may be even higher in related Afro-Caribbean populations living in the Americas and Europe.
 Clinically, ATTR also presents as ATTR-PN, a neurodegenerative disease, in individuals carrying pathogenic TTR mutations. Patients suffering from ATTR-PN generally become symptomatic between ages 30 and 50. While the median survival for patients diagnosed with ATTR-PN is only five to ten years, the various disease complications from initial onset create a substantial economic and social burden on patients, caregivers and the entire healthcare system. In ATTR-PN patients, symptoms generally begin with pain in the extremities from nerve damage, loss of sensation, limb weakness, and GI dysfunction leading to malnutrition. Patients generally lose motor control (muscle strength, tone and bulk) and sensation in their extremities, starting with the feet and ascending to involve the lower and upper legs followed by the hands and arms. As the disease progresses up the legs to the body, patients lose the ability to walk without assistance, and eventually lose the ability to control basic motor and sensory functions. Loss of sensation exposes patients to the risk of so-called insensate trauma, or the inability to notice that they have sustained injuries to their hands and feet, which may become complicated by infection and require hospitalization for intravenous therapy or amputation.
 ATTR-PN is caused by pathogenic, destabilizing mutations in the TTR gene and affects approximately 10,000 patients worldwide. The V30M mutation is the most prevalent mutation associated with ATTR-PN and is endemic in certain areas of Portugal, Sweden and Japan, where it has arisen independently as a founder mutation, as illustrated in the figure below.

 Mutant ATTR (ATTRm) spans a spectrum of phenotypic expression from predominantly cardiomyopathic (as in the case of the prevalent mutation V122I) to predominantly polyneuropathic (as in the case of V30M, especially the early onset subset), with many mutations driving a mixed clinical phenotype, as illustrated in the figure below. The symptoms associated with wild-type ATTR (ATTRwt) are predominantly cardiovascular, but may include connective tissue disease such as carpal tunnel syndrome.

 Unmet medical need in ATTR
 Despite recent progress in the development of disease-modifying therapies for ATTR, we believe clinical unmet need remains. In ATTR-PN, treatment options had historically been limited to symptomatic relief, with liver transplantation being the only definitive treatment to arrest the progression of disease. This therapy, however, is complicated by limited organ availability, the need for lifelong immunosuppression, surgical risk (especially in patients with substantial cardiac involvement) and limited efficacy, as wild-type TTR amyloid continues to contribute to disease progression in many patients after transplant.
 Recent advancements have been made in the development of disease-modifying therapies for ATTR-PN. Phase 3 clinical trials of TTR gene-silencing, or “knockdown” agents (patisiran and inotersen) demonstrated clinically important and statistically significant results in the treatment of ATTR-PN, and both agents have now been approved by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and FDA for the treatment of ATTR-PN. Regulatory 
 7

authorities outside of the United States, including the EMA, have also approved tafamidis for the treatment of ATTR-PN, although its single Phase 3 clinical trial in ATTR-PN patients did not meet its primary endpoint. Tafamidis was approved by the European Union in 2011 and Japan in 2013. The FDA, in contrast, requested additional trials to be completed as a prerequisite for any resubmission for U.S. approval. Additionally, diflunisal, a generic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, approved by the FDA to treat pain and inflammation, may be prescribed by physicians for ATTR patients, despite not having been approved for the treatment of ATTR. Diflunisal exhibits some biochemical properties as a TTR stabilizer and has been studied in a randomized study in ATTR-PN patients funded by the National Institutes of Health. The use of diflunisal is limited, however, by its Boxed Warning in the U.S. Product Insert (label) listing increased risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, thromboembolic events (clotting and blood vessel blockage), and kidney failure. These are all “on-target” complications related to diflunisal’s intended inhibition of the cyclooxygenase, or COX, enzyme.  Given the overlap between its labeled risk of serious adverse effects and the prominent cardiovascular and renal manifestations in these patients, its usage is limited in the treatment of ATTR-CM. While diflunisal is commercially available as a generic, prescription-only medical product in the United States, it is generally unavailable in the European Union and elsewhere.
 More limited progress has been made in the development of a safe and effective, disease-modifying treatment of ATTRwt-CM and ATTRm-CM. Recently, Pfizer Inc. announced that its Phase 3 clinical trial (ATTR-ACT) of tafamidis in ATTRwt-CM and ATTRm-CM patients had met its primary endpoint, a reduction in the combination of all-cause mortality and cumulative incidence of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations. In January 2019, Pfizer reported that the FDA accepted its two NDAs for tafamidis to treat ATTR-CM. The only Phase 3 clinical trial of a TTR knockdown agent in patients with diagnosed cardiomyopathy, the ENDEAVOUR study of revusiran sponsored by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., was halted due to an imbalance of deaths in the active treatment arms. Given the significant and growing prevalence of ATTRwt-CM and ATTRm-CM, and the limitations of marketed drugs and product candidates for all forms of ATTR, we believe there is a significant unmet need for an efficacious therapeutic agent that targets the disease at its source.
 AG10—our differentiated solution for the treatment of ATTR
 AG10 is an orally-administered small molecule designed to treat ATTR at its source by stabilizing tetrameric TTR, thereby halting at its outset the series of molecular events that give rise to ATTR. The following graphic illustrates the disease mechanism of ATTR and our therapeutic hypothesis.

Multiple therapeutic approaches are in clinical and preclinical development for the treatment of ATTR. These therapeutic approaches are referred to as stabilization, knockdown and clearance.
  
• | Stabilization. Small molecule stabilizers, including AG10, target the disease at its source by stabilizing TTR and inhibiting the disease-initiating step of amyloid formation (i.e., the dissociation of tetrameric TTR into monomers). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Knockdown. Knockdown approaches inhibit the synthesis of TTR by the liver, thereby reducing the amount of circulating tetrameric TTR and presumably the amount of TTR monomers available to form amyloid deposits. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clearance. Agents target the amyloid formation process further downstream and/or established amyloid deposits. The goal of these agents is to disrupt the formation of circulating TTR amyloid precursors (aggregates of misfolded monomers) and/or clear amyloid fibrils that have already been deposited. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that the TTR stabilization approach targets ATTR at its source and represents a validated therapeutic approach to prevent or slow disease progression. In addition, we believe our therapeutic approach has the potential to complement other approaches to treating ATTR.
 The therapeutic approach of AG10 leverages over 25 years of research understanding the molecular mechanism of ATTR and the rational design using structural biology by our founders at Stanford University. We believe the therapeutic hypothesis underlying TTR stabilization is validated by human genetic and clinical data, as follows:
  
• | Genetic data demonstrate not only how the disease is caused (through mutations that destabilize the TTR tetramer) but also how the disease is ameliorated (through mutations that super-stabilize tetrameric TTR). Furthermore, beneficial effects of the naturally-occurring, stabilizing mutation T119M have been demonstrated in both a diseased and healthy population;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tafamidis, a TTR stabilizer, reportedly met its primary endpoint in the reduction in the combination of all-cause mortality and cumulative incidence of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in ATTR-CM patients in Pfizer’s global, Phase 3 ATTR-ACT clinical trial.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Genetic validation of TTR stabilization
 The concept of TTR tetramer stabilization as a viable therapeutic approach originated from our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of ATTR, as well as a naturally-occurring rescue mutation. The molecular pathogenesis of ATTR has been described in over 25 years of scientific publications. Specifically, ATTR results from the dissociation of native, tetrameric TTR into monomeric subunits that misfold and aggregate as TTR amyloid. There are over 140 known pathogenic, missense mutations that destabilize TTR. On the other hand, there exist naturally occurring mutations that protect against disease, and have been shown to stabilize TTR. A naturally-occurring, gain-of-function rescue mutation, T119M, results in the super-stabilization of TTR and prevents ATTR in compound heterozygotes carrying the V30M disease-causing mutation, as reported by Coelho et al. in 1996 and Hammarstrom et. al in Science in 2001. The T119M mutation, when carried in otherwise healthy individuals, is also associated with both a lower risk of cerebrovascular events and an increased life expectancy of five to ten years compared to healthy non-carriers, and is correlated with 17% higher circulating levels of TTR. This result was identified by Hornstrup et. al. in a 2013 study of over 68,000 individuals in Denmark over an average 32 years of clinical follow-up. AG10’s mode of binding is designed to mimic the stabilizing mechanism of this rescue mutation, which we believe provides a mechanistic advantage to slow or halt the progression of ATTR. In addition, the scientific literature suggests that this mode of binding may be unique to AG10.
 Clinical validation of TTR stabilization
 In March 2018, Pfizer announced that tafamidis, a TTR stabilizer, met its primary endpoint of a reduction in the combination of all-cause mortality and cumulative incidence of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in both types of ATTR-CM patients in the Phase 3 ATTR-ACT study. The trial enrolled 441 patients including 106 (24%) ATTRm-CM and 335 (76%) ATTRwt-CM patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I-III symptoms. Subjects were randomized to placebo, 20 mg tafamidis, or 80 mg tafamidis in a 2:1:2 ratio. Rates of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations were reduced by approximately 30% in tafamidis-treated subjects relative to subjects receiving placebo. Tafamidis treatment was also associated with a slower rate of decline in 6-minute walk distance and quality of life as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary. Tafamidis is the first therapeutic to show a benefit in a prospective ATTR-CM clinical trial and validates the hypothesis that TTR stabilization can lead to a meaningful clinical benefit in this population. Further, we believe that the reported reduction in mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations observed in a randomized clinical trial of a TTR stabilizer, combined with the convenience of oral dosing, supports potential first line usage of oral TTR stabilizers in ATTR-CM.

The reported outcomes from previous clinical trials with TTR stabilizers in ATTR-PN further support the TTR stabilization approach and suggest that increasing levels of TTR stabilization may lead to increasing levels of clinical benefit. To support this hypothesis, we evaluated each of three small molecule stabilizers (tafamidis, diflunisal and AG10) in head-to-head, established in vitro TTR stabilization assays (Western blot and FPE) and compared these results to the reported clinical outcomes, leading to the following observations:
  
• | Tafamidis, at the reported mean peak plasma concentration achieved at steady state on a 20 mg daily oral dose in healthy volunteers, was observed to stabilize approximately 45% of TTR in our in vitro studies. At this dose, tafamidis demonstrated a non-statistically significant improvement relative to placebo in ATTR-PN patients in a Phase 3 clinical trial conducted by FoldRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (acquired by Pfizer Inc.).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Diflunisal, a generic NSAID, stabilized TTR by approximately 75% in our in vitro studies and showed a statistically significant improvement relative to placebo in ATTR-PN patients in a randomized, controlled study.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AG10 achieves greater than 90% TTR stabilization in in vitro assays at concentrations achieved at trough in our clinical studies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The following table summarizes the levels of TTR stabilization observed to date in our preclinical stabilization assays of tafamidis, diflunisal and AG10, as compared to their reported clinical outcomes in ATTR-PN:
 
In the table above, the figures for percent stabilization at peak concentration represent values averaged between Western blot and FPE assays, except for diflunisal, which only includes data from Western blot assays. We used commercially available tafamidis in the Western blot assays and synthesized tafamidis in the FPE assays. Although we believe our preclinical observations described above are consistent with the reported clinical literature, the use of synthesized tafamidis in our preclinical studies may not be indicative of results that would be obtained using commercially-available tafamidis.
 AG10
 Our clinical program has provided positive results in a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers and a Phase 2 study in patients with ATTR-CM. Having met with the FDA to discuss a potential approval pathway for AG10 at the end of 2018, we have recently begun enrolling patients in a Phase 3 study in patients with ATTR-CM and plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in patients with ATTR-PN in 2019.
  
• | In our Phase 1 clinical trial, AG10 was well-tolerated and the highest tested dose achieved 100% TTR stabilization at peak concentrations and over 95% TTR stabilization on average in healthy adult volunteers at steady state.

• | In our Phase 2 clinical trial, AG10 was well tolerated in symptomatic ATTRwt-CM and ATTRm-CM patients receiving 400 mg or 800 mg twice daily for 28 days. AG10 treatment significantly raised serum TTR concentrations (p < 0.0001 vs placebo), a biomarker associated with survival in ATTR-CM patients, by 50% and 36% in subjects administered 800 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, respectively, at Day 28. All AG10-treated patients had tetrameric TTR levels within the normal clinical range at Day 28.

• | Our Phase 3 study in ATTR-CM (ATTRibute-CM) is planned to enroll approximately 510 subjects with symptomatic ATTR-CM, including both wild-type and mutant TTR carriers with New York Heart Association Class I-III symptoms. Subjects will be randomized 2:1 between treatment (AG10 800 mg twice daily) and placebo. In Part A, change in 6MWD at 12 months will be compared between treatment and placebo groups as the primary endpoint. In Part B, the study will continue for a total duration of 30 months, at which point all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations will be compared between treatment and control groups.

 Clinical data
 Phase 1 clinical trial of AG10
 In September 2017, following acceptance of our IND application for AG10 in ATTR-CM, we initiated our first clinical trial of AG10. The study was designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending dose study in healthy adult volunteers. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of AG10. The secondary objectives were to characterize the PK of AG10 and to describe the PD properties of AG10, as well as the PK-PD relationship of AG10 in healthy adult subjects.
 Part A consists of a single ascending dose, or SAD, design, where four cohorts of eight healthy individuals were randomized to receive AG10 or placebo in a 3:1 overall ratio. Part B consists of a multiple ascending dose, or MAD, design, where three cohorts of eight healthy individuals were randomized to receive AG10 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. A total of 32 subjects, 24 dosed with AG10 and eight with placebo to match, completed Part A with doses of 50 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg or 800 mg of AG10. In Part B, a total of 24 subjects, 18 dosed with AG10 and six with placebo to match, were dosed with 100 mg, 300 mg or 800 mg AG10 every 12 hours for 12 days. 
 Results from both the SAD and MAD parts of the study indicate that AG10 was well-tolerated. No deaths or SAEs were reported during the study and no subject discontinued study drug or the study due to an AE. Most AEs were reported by single subjects in both the SAD and MAD parts, and all were mild to moderate in intensity. The only AEs that occurred in more than one subject were dry mouth, generalized headache, upper respiratory infection, and dizziness, all of which occurred in two separate subjects. No AEs were reported as “probable” with regards to their relationship to AG10.Below is a summary of our observations of treatment emergent SAEs and AEs observed in the Phase 1 study.

PK properties of AG10 were evaluated in both parts of the trial. The data indicate that AG10 is rapidly absorbed (peak concentrations achieved within 1 hour of dosing), and the terminal half-life of the compound is approximately 25 hours. Plasma concentrations achieved in these studies reached our expected steady-state target concentrations. The PK of AG10 in the MAD portion of the study is shown below.
 

We evaluated the PD properties of AG10 with the fluorescent probe exclusion, or FPE, and Western blot assays, both previously reported assays of TTR stabilization. The percentage of TTR stabilization as measured by the FPE assay at peak, trough and on average over the dosing interval at steady-state (Day 12) in the MAD portion of the study is shown below. The data from the highest tested daily dose demonstrated 100% steady-state TTR stabilization in all subjects at peak drug concentration measured shortly after oral dosing. At the same 800 mg dose administered every 12 hours, TTR stabilization on average over the dosing interval and at trough (pre-dose at steady state) was 96% and 92%, respectively. We believe these are the highest levels of ex vivo TTR stabilization demonstrated in any clinical trial of a TTR stabilizer and support AG10’s potential to slow or halt the progression of ATTR.
 
12

TTR stabilization was also measured using the Western blot assay. Summarized quantification (mean +/- standard deviation) of all MAD data is shown below. These data similarly showed high levels of TTR stabilization in all MAD cohorts at peak and trough concentrations. Further, the blots demonstrate that near-complete TTR stabilization was achieved at 60 hours following final dose in the cohort dosed with 800 mg every 12 hours.


Phase 2 clinical trial of AG10
 In November 2018, we completed our Phase 2 clinical trial of AG10 in symptomatic ATTR-CM. The study was designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AG10 administered to adult subjects with symptomatic ATTR-CM. The secondary objectives were to characterize the pharmacokinetics of AG10 in symptomatic ATTR-CM subjects and to describe the pharmacodynamic properties of AG10, as well as the PK-PD relationship of AG10. The PD assessments of TTR stabilization were measured by fluorescent probe exclusion, Western blot, and serum prealbumin (TTR).
 The trial design is depicted below. Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo or 400 mg or 800 mg of AG10 twice daily. The study enrolled 49 symptomatic ATTR-CM subjects, of which 14 had known mutant ATTR-CM. The confirmed variants were V122I, T60A, and V30M.
 

13

Enrolled symptomatic ATTR-CM subjects ranged in age from 60-86 years, with a mean age of 74.1, and 92% were male. 29% of subjects presented with NYHA Class III heart failure symptoms and subjects had high baseline NT-proBNP with a mean of 3368 pg/mL. Additionally, on average, subjects had relatively low TTR at baseline with a mean of 22.0 mg/dL. The baseline characteristics are shown below.
 

Overall, AG10 was well-tolerated in symptomatic ATTR-CM subjects with no lab safety signals of potential clinical concern attributed to study drug. 88% of subjects administered placebo experienced adverse events, or AEs, whereas 63% and 69% of subjects administered 400 mg and 800 mg AG10 experienced AEs, respectively. In both the placebo and active treatment groups, most of the AEs were mild to moderate in severity. The most commonly observed AEs, occurring in 4 or more subjects across the treatment groups, were atrial fibrillation, constipation, diarrhea, and muscle spasms. Among the reported serious adverse events, or SAEs, one placebo-treated subject experienced atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure and another placebo-treated subject experienced cellulitis in their lower extremity. One AG10-treated subject experienced an SAE of shortness of breath on study, and this observation was not considered related to study drug.
 14

Below is a summary of our observations of treatment emergent SAEs and AEs observed in the Phase 2 study.
 

Ex-vivo stabilization assays demonstrated near-complete TTR stabilization by AG10, with greater than 90% average tetramer stabilization in subjects treated with 400 mg or 800 mg AG10. The stabilization response was consistent across mutant and wild-type TTR carriers and replicates previously reported clinical and preclinical TTR stabilization data. 
 

15

The effect of AG10 was also measured using the serum concentration of tetrameric TTR, a biomarker associated with survival in ATTR-CM patients. Subjects in the placebo group experienced a mean reduction in serum TTR concentrations over the course of the study. Conversely, subjects administered AG10 showed a dose-dependent increase in tetrameric TTR. There was a greater observed treatment effect in subjects with mutant ATTR-CM as compared to subjects with wild-type ATTR-CM, which we believe can be explained, in part, by the lower absolute serum TTR of mutant ATTR-CM subjects at baseline. 
 

The proportion of subjects below and above normal tetrameric TTR was also assessed at baseline and Day 28.  ATTR-CM patients with below normal TTR have a shorter life expectancy than patients within the normal range. Treatment with AG10 restored serum TTR concentrations to normal range in all subjects at Day 28. The normal reference range for serum TTR is 20-40 mg/dL.
 
Anticipated clinical and regulatory path for AG10
 In November and December of 2018, we met with the FDA to discuss a potential regulatory path for AG10 in ATTR-CM. Following these discussions, we have begun enrolling patients a randomized, global Phase 3 study of AG10 in ATTR-CM patients (ATTRibute-CM). ATTRibute-CM will enroll approximately 510 subjects with symptomatic ATTR-CM, including both wild-type and mutant TTR carriers with New York Heart Association Class I-III symptoms. Subjects will be randomized 2:1 between treatment (AG10 800 mg twice daily) and placebo. In 
 16

Part A, change in 6MWD at 12 months will be compared between treatment and placebo groups as a potential registrational endpoint. In Part B, the study will continue for a total duration of 30 months, at which point all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations will be compared between treatment and control groups. A schematic of the trial is shown below:
 

We believe the safety and tolerability data of AG10 in healthy volunteers and in ATTR-CM patients will also be relevant for the ATTR-PN patient population. Subject to authorization from applicable regulatory authorities, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical development program for AG10 in ATTR-PN in 2019. We do not intend to file an IND with the FDA for this indication as we plan to conduct this study outside of the United States.
 We believe that, if approved, AG10 has the potential to demonstrate benefit as a best-in-class stabilizer for the treatment of ATTR. Systematic reviews of recent commercial drug launches demonstrate that compounds that exhibit positive qualities over other existing compounds can achieve significant, and in some instances the leading market share even if they are not the first approved product for a particular indication. Further, we believe certain qualities of the ATTR-CM market could yield additional benefits to a compelling therapeutic. Specifically, the ATTR-CM market is sufficiently large and heterogenous that subsets of patients may be unresponsive to any particular therapy, causing physicians to cycle between available therapies. In addition, the potential growth of the market may lead to a large number of newly diagnosed cases which would not require switching from an established therapy to a novel and promising agent.
 Preclinical data for AG10 in ATTR
 The advancement of AG10 into clinical trials was based on multiple lines of evidence that we believe support the potential for AG10 to be a disease-modifying TTR stabilizer.
  
• | Unique binding mode: We believe AG10 is the only TTR stabilizer that mimics the binding mode of the naturally-occurring, super-stabilizing T119M mutation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17

 
• | TTR affinity and selectivity: In preclinical testing, AG10 has been observed to exhibit greater specificity for TTR than tafamidis. Compared to tafamidis, AG10’s binding to TTR is less affected by the presence of other plasma proteins, allowing a greater fraction of AG10 to bind TTR.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Near-complete TTR stabilization: In established preclinical assays, AG10 has demonstrated the highest levels of TTR stabilization compared to other TTR stabilizers at clinically-relevant concentrations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stabilization of WT and mutant TTR: Using serum samples from ATTR patients, we have demonstrated that AG10 is able to near-completely stabilize a wide range of TTR variants.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Unique binding mode
 AG10’s mode of binding is designed to mimic the naturally-occurring, super-stabilizing T119M rescue mutation, which we believe provides a mechanistic advantage in potentially slowing or halting the progression of ATTR. To our knowledge, this mode of binding is unique to AG10 among product candidates under clinical development for ATTR. The binding modes of the T119M variant and AG10 are further described below.
 The T119M mutation “super-stabilizes” the tetramer by bringing the TTR monomers closer together, allowing for strong electrostatic interactions (hydrogen bonds and salt bridges) between adjacent monomers that stabilize the tetramer. In the thyroxine binding pocket of wild-type TTR, the serine 117 residues on each of the adjacent monomeric subunits are too far apart to form hydrogen bonds, as illustrated in the ribbon diagram below.
 

The T119M variant, depicted below, results in structural changes in the tetramer such that the serine residues are now close enough to each other (under 3 angstroms) to permit hydrogen bonds to form between serine residues in adjacent monomers, holding the tetramer more tightly together than in the wild-type tetramer.
 

18

By similarly facilitating the formation of hydrogen bonds with the serines at position 117, we believe AG10 structurally mimics the disease-suppressing mechanism of the T119M rescue mutation. As illustrated in the diagram below, AG10 has been observed to bind to TTR and participate in hydrogen bonding interactions with the serine 117 residues on adjacent monomers, stabilizing the tetramer in a manner similar to that observed in the T119M mutant protein. We also believe AG10’s binding mode, which mimics that of the naturally occurring, disease-suppressing T119M rescue mutation, may lead to a slowing or halting of the dissociation of tetrameric TTR into monomers, the disease-initiating step in ATTR. To our knowledge, AG10 is the only compound in clinical development that mimics the structural effect of the T119M mutation with interactions at the bottom of the thyroxine binding pocket to confer TTR stabilization.
 

Published isothermal titration calorimetry studies demonstrate that the binding mode of AG10 to TTR is almost entirely driven by enthalpy, or the strength of the chemical bonds. In contrast, the binding of tafamidis to TTR is driven approximately only 50% by enthalpy. We believe that the relative enthalpic binding mode of AG10 as compared to tafamidis confers additional stability to the tetramer, thereby preventing the dissociation of tetrameric TTR into monomers.
 TTR affinity and selectivity
 In addition to its unique binding mode, AG10 has been observed in preclinical studies to bind to TTR with high affinity and specificity. TTR has two binding sites for its native ligand, thyroxine, or the small molecule stabilizers that bind into the same pocket. Binding to these sites is non-cooperative, meaning that binding to the second site becomes less likely after a molecule is bound to the first. However, we believe binding to both sites may be required for complete TTR stabilization. AG10 has been shown to exhibit high binding affinity, as represented by its single-digit nanomolar dissociation constant, to TTR at its first site, and additionally an approximately 140-300 nanomolar dissociation constant at its second site. A dissociation constant measures the proportion of a compound that is bound to its target, with a lower dissociation constant implying stronger binding affinity. Based on ex vivo data from our Phase 1 clinical trial, we believe AG10 may bind TTR and potentially occupy more than one binding site per tetramer molecule.
 AG10 binding to TTR has been observed to be also highly specific. In vitro assays demonstrate that AG10 has the potential to stabilize TTR while not being affected by the presence of other plasma proteins. In preclinical studies, approximately 3.6% of non-protein bound AG10 was observed to circulate in human plasma at relevant clinical concentrations, suggesting an available pool of compound to bind to newly synthesized TTR. In contrast, we believe the ability of synthesized tafamidis to bind and stabilize TTR is reduced in the presence of other proteins (particularly albumin, which is present at high concentrations in human plasma). Specifically, in published regulatory documents, the free fraction of tafamidis is less than 0.5% in human peripheral blood, suggesting that the majority of non-TTR bound tafamidis is bound to other plasma proteins. We believe data from our preclinical studies suggesting AG10’s ability to bind TTR with high affinity and specificity support its potential to be a preferred TTR stabilizer for the treatment of ATTR.
 19

Near-complete TTR stabilization 
 In established preclinical assays, AG10 demonstrated near-complete levels of TTR stabilization at clinically-relevant concentrations, further supporting our belief that AG10 could be a compelling therapeutic for ATTR.
 In vitro studies demonstrated that AG10 potently stabilizes TTR at doses tested in our Phase 1 clinical trial, as evaluated in three separate, established assays. In one assay, immunoblotting, or Western blots, were used to measure TTR stabilization as demonstrated by the percentage of tetrameric TTR remaining under accelerated destabilizing conditions (acidic pH). Shown below is the dose response effect of AG10 and commercially available tafamidis on stabilizing TTR at different compound concentrations. AG10 was observed to completely stabilize TTR at doses tested in our Phase 1 clinical trial and demonstrated greater TTR stabilization than tafamidis in this assay. The following graphs show the amount of TTR stabilization, as measured by the Western blot assay, using the solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide, or DMSO, and at different concentrations of AG10 and commercially available tafamidis:
 
20

The fluorescent probe exclusion (FPE) assay is a competitive binding assay that measures the ability of a stabilizer to block the binding of a small molecule probe to the thyroxine binding site of TTR. A fluorescent signal is emitted only when the probe is bound to TTR. In the plots below, AG10 and tafamidis, as synthesized for use in our preclinical studies, were compared head-to-head under identical assay conditions. At the clinical concentrations achieved by AG10 in our Phase 1 clinical trial (see “Clinical range” in figure below), AG10 was observed to occupy more than 90% of TTR tetramers. For tafamidis, clinical concentrations reported in regulatory documents predict plasma concentrations from an 80 mg daily dose shown below. These concentrations were observed to result in approximately 55-65% TTR occupancy. The following graphs show the amount of TTR stabilization, as measured by the FPE assay, using DMSO and at different concentrations of AG10 and commercially available tafamidis:
 

Stabilization of WT and mutant TTR
 In addition, ex vivo studies in patient blood samples have supported AG10’s stabilization effects on TTR across several pathogenic mutations. Over 140 mutations leading to ATTR-CM and ATTR-PN have been described. We selected mutations that occur at different amino acid positions in the protein, as shown below, to test the hypothesis that AG10 could stabilize multiple TTR variants as well as wild-type protein.
 
21

Blood samples were obtained from patients carrying a series of mutations that are distributed throughout the primary amino acid sequence of the protein and are manifest across a spectrum of clinical phenotypes. In in vitro experiments, AG10 was added to patient sera and then evaluated for AG10’s ability to stabilize TTR. AG10 was observed to potently stabilize all the tested TTR mutations, as measured by FPE assay and Western blots. Shown below are the Western blot results illustrating the effects of AG10 on variant TTR.
 
We believe the results for our nonclinical studies strongly support the continued clinical development of AG10 for ATTR.
 Additional opportunities
 We may evaluate opportunities to expand our capabilities and product pipeline. Consistent with our strategy, we may look for assets that target well-defined genetic diseases at their source. Complementary approaches in ATTR are the most synergistic opportunity. We may also pursue acquisition or in-licensing of adjacent precision cardiovascular medicine assets.
 Manufacturing
 Given the small molecule and oral formulation of AG10, we believe the synthesis of the drug substance for AG10 is reliable and reproducible from readily available starting materials, and the synthetic routes are amenable to large-scale production and do not require unusual equipment or handling in the manufacturing process. We have already established the synthetic process and scaled up to large kilogram quantities similar to the campaigns that will be required to provide drug product for our anticipated Phase 3 clinical trials. We are engaging secondary raw material suppliers and North American and European CMOs to mitigate supply chain risk and ensure continuity of supply of drug substance. To maximize flexibility, we have established relationships with non-overlapping vendors for supply of both starting materials as well as drug substance manufacturing.
 Drug product formulation for AG10 has been developed as a film coated tablet and continues to be optimized. We have contracted North American third-party manufacturers capable of both formulation development and drug product manufacturing through commercialization. We have identified dual sources for each step of our manufacturing process to add additional capacity and redundancy to our supply chain. The formulations used in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of AG10 were immediate release tablets. We have developed a higher dose strength tablet for use in our Phase 3 studies. For future development and commercialization, we intend to further optimize the formulation to reduce pill burden and facilitate compliance.
 22

We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently depend on third-party CMOs for all of our requirements of raw materials, drug substance and drug product for our preclinical research and our ongoing clinical trial of AG10. We have not entered into long-term agreements with our current CMOs. We intend to continue to rely on CMOs for later-stage development and commercialization of AG10, as well as the development and commercialization of any other product candidates that we may identify. Although we rely on CMOs, we have personnel and third-party consultants with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our contract manufacturers.
 Sales and marketing
 We intend to begin building a commercial infrastructure in the United States and selected other territories to support the commercialization of AG10 when we believe a regulatory approval in a particular territory is likely. Because ATTR-CM and ATTR-PN are rare diseases with a concentrated prescribing audience and a small number of key opinion leaders who influence the treatments prescribed for the relevant patient population, we believe that we can effectively address the market using our own targeted, specialty sales and marketing organization supported by internal sales personnel, an internal marketing group and distribution support.
 In any core markets outside of the United States that we may identify, where appropriate, we may utilize strategic partners, distributors or contract sales forces to expand the commercial availability of AG10. We currently do not expect that we will require large pharmaceutical partners for the commercialization of AG10 or any other product candidates we may identify and pursue, although we may consider partnering in certain territories or indications or for other strategic purposes. We intend to evaluate our commercialization strategy as we advance AG10 through clinical development.
 Intellectual property
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents and patent applications intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We have entered into an exclusive license agreement with The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, or Stanford, to obtain the rights to use certain patents for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. See “—Our material agreements—License agreement with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University.” We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights protecting our commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our current and future issued patents, if any, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our intellectual property portfolio. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any patents, if issued, will provide sufficient protection from competitors.
 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention.
 23

Patents and patent applications
 Our patent portfolio includes six issued U.S. patents, one allowed U.S. patent application, two pending U.S. patent applications, one patent in Europe and one patent Japan.  Additionally, our portfolio includes one pending application in Europe, one pending application in Taiwan and an international application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT).  Our portfolio further includes five provisional U.S. applications in two separate application families.
 Specifically, our patent portfolio includes five issued U.S. patents, exclusively licensed from Stanford, which are directed to AG10’s composition of matter and methods of use.
 These patents are currently expected to expire in 2031 or 2033, absent any applicable patent term extensions.  Our patent portfolio licensed from Stanford also includes one pending U.S. patent application, one European patent and one pending European patent application, as well as one issued Japanese patent with claims directed to composition of matter and methods of its use related to AG10.  These patents and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2031 and 2033, absent any applicable patent term extensions.
 In addition, we are the sole assignee of three patent families directed to particular salt/solid forms of AG10, methods of manufacturing AG10, dosing methods using AG10, and formulations of AG10.  One of the families consists of a pending U.S. patent application, a pending PCT patent application and one related pending patent application in Taiwan.  If issued, these patent applications are expected to expire in 2038, absent any applicable patent term adjustments or extensions.  The remaining two patent families consist of provisional patent application(s) only.
 Patent term
 The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority assuming that all maintenance fees are paid. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the USPTO the extent of which is offset by delays by the patent owner before the USPTO in obtaining the patent. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by a terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent. The term of a U.S. patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extension on patents, if issued, covering those products, and/or their methods of use.
 Trade secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entities’ relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.

Our material agreements
 License agreement with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University
 In April 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Stanford for rights relating to novel transthyretin aggregation inhibitors. Under our agreement, Stanford has granted us an exclusive worldwide license to make, use and sell products that are covered by the licensed patent rights. This license grant expires when the last licensed patent expires. The patent rights exclusively licensed to us under the license are described in more detail above under the heading “—Intellectual property.”
 Stanford retains the right, on behalf of itself and all other non-profit academic research institutions, to practice under the patent rights for any non-profit purpose, including sponsored research and collaborations. We may grant sublicenses to third parties so long as we are actively pursuing the development or commercialization of products covered by the patent rights. We may also be required to sublicense our rights under the agreement at Stanford’s request under certain conditions, including if we are unwilling or unable to serve a potential market or territory and there is a third party willing to be a sublicensee in such market or territory.
 We are obligated to pay to Stanford a yearly license maintenance fee during the term of the agreement, but we may offset the maintenance fee against earned royalty payments due on net sales occurring in that year. Stanford is entitled to receive a royalty as a percentage of net sales of licensed products, in the low single digits. We have agreed to pay Stanford a percentage of non-royalty revenue we receive from our sublicensees, with the amount owed decreasing annually for three years based on when we enter into the applicable sublicense agreement. We also issued to Stanford 56,809 shares of our common stock with a price of $0.15 per share, the fair market value at the time of issuance, a portion of which were issued directly to Drs. Graef and Alhamadsheh. In addition, we are obligated to pay Stanford up to approximately $1.0 million upon the achievement of specific intellectual property, clinical and regulatory milestone events. In the event of a change of control transaction, we are obligated to pay Stanford a change of control fee of $250,000 in connection with the assignment of the license agreement to our acquirer.
 Under the license agreement with Stanford, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, and commercialize at least one licensed product; to develop markets for such licensed products; and to meet certain development milestones as agreed upon between us and Stanford.
 Subject to the expiration of the license grant described above, the agreement does not have a specified term. We may terminate the agreement by providing prior written notice to Stanford, and Stanford has the right to terminate the agreement if we fail to achieve certain milestones or make payments under the agreement or are not actively pursuing development of a licensed product, or if we otherwise materially breach the agreement and fail to cure such breach within a specified grace period.
 Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. There are many public and private biopharmaceutical companies, universities, governmental agencies and other research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our product candidates or address similar markets. In addition, the number of companies seeking to develop and commercialize products and therapies similar to our product candidates is likely to increase. In the area of ATTR, we expect to face competition from competitors targeting three distinct mechanisms of action: TTR stabilization, TTR knockdown, and TTR clearance.
 Among TTR stabilizers, we expect to face competition from tafamidis. Tafamidis is an oral TTR stabilizer that is approved in select geographies outside of the United States for Stage 1 (early stage) ATTR-PN. In August 2018, Pfizer Inc. announced that its Phase 3 clinical trial (ATTR-ACT) of tafamidis in ATTRwt-CM and ATTRm-CM patients had met its primary endpoint, a reduction in the combination of all-cause mortality and cumulative incidence of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations. In January 2019, Pfizer announced that the FDA accepted its two NDAs for tafamidis to treat ATTR-CM. Corino Therapeutics Inc./SOM Innovation Biotech, S.L. is developing SOM0226 (tolcapone, CRX-1008), an oral, small molecule TTR stabilizer for ATTR. Tolcapone is a generic drug that is FDA-approved for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. The drug has demonstrated significant liver toxicity and consequently, had been previously removed from the US market. The marketing authorization in the US was renewed in August 2009, but it remains off the market in a number of other countries, including Australia, Bulgaria, and Iceland. Corino Therapeutics/SOM Biotech completed a Phase 2a trial of tolcapone in ATTR-PN. Diflunisal, a generic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indicated for mild to moderate pain and arthritis, may also be considered a competitor, having been shown to significantly slow development of ATTR-PN in a randomized Phase 2/3 trial. Diflunisal’s label contains a boxed warning for cardiovascular, renal and gastrointestinal risks.
 25

Potentially competitive TTR knockdown approaches are being pursued by multiple companies. In 2018, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Alnylam, received marketing authorization from both the FDA and EMA for Onpattro (patisiran), an intravenously administered RNAi therapeutic for the treatment of hereditary ATTR with polyneuropathy. Alnylam is also developing ALN-TTRsc02 (vutrisiran), a subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic for ATTR. Alnylam has reportedly completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of ALN-TTRsc02 in healthy volunteers and initiated a Phase 3 trial in patients with hereditary ATTR with polyneuropathy. Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc./Akcea Therapeutics, Inc. received marketing approval from both the FDA and EMA in 2018 for Tegsedi (inotersen), an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) drug, for hereditary ATTR with polyneuropathy. Intellia’s program is currently in preclinical development. Arcturus Therapeutics Ltd. is developing LUNAR-TTR, a lipid-based RNA medicine currently in preclinical development.
 Therapeutics targeting TTR clearance may also be competitive to AG10. Prothena Therapeutics plc is developing PRX004, a monoclonal antibody, for ATTR that is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Neurimmune Holding AG is also developing a recombinant human antibody for ATTR that is in preclinical development.
 Government regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
 U.S. government regulation of drug products
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 26

 
• | Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical studies
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to initiate.
 Clinical trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it initiates at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Marketing approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA, for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
 27

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. An Agreed Initial Pediatric Study Plan requesting a waiver from the requirement to conduct clinical studies has been submitted to the FDA.
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Special FDA expedited review and approval programs
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
 28

To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Many products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
 In addition, products tested for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures if, for example, the sponsor fails to confirm clinical benefit.
 Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
 Accelerated approval pathway
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug.
 29

The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will be receiving orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.
 U.S. marketing exclusivity
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for the original non-modified version of the drug. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 30

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 Post-approval requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments where such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval of a drug or medical device is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs or devices may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 31

Other healthcare laws
 Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products for which we obtain marketing approval. Arrangements with third party payors, healthcare providers and physicians, in connection with the clinical research, sales, marketing and promotion of products, once approved, and related activities, may expose a pharmaceutical manufacturer to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below:
  
• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward, referrals including the purchase recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil “qui tam” or “whistleblower” actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal health care programs that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making or causing a false statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay money to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing such an obligation.

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Efforts to ensure that business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against a pharmaceutical manufacturer, and it is not successful in defending itself or asserting its rights, those actions could have a significant impact on its business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, integrity and oversight agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of operations, any of which could adversely affect a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s ability to operate its business and the results of operations. In addition, commercialization of any drug product outside the United States will also likely be subject to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.
 Current and future healthcare reform legislation
 In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system. In particular, in 2010 the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
 There have been a number of significant changes to the ACA and its implementation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision repealing effective January 1, 2019 the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. In addition, in 2017 President Trump signed executive orders directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices, and terminated the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. Further, on June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, by increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and closing the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. In July 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain Affordable Care Act qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. In addition, CMS has recently published a final rule that would give states greater flexibility, starting in 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well.  The Trump Administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the Texas District Court Judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 33

The full impact of the ACA, any law repealing, replacing, or modifying elements of it, and the political uncertainty surrounding its repeal, replacement, or modification on our business, as well as the impact of other healthcare legislative reform  measures, remain unclear. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability and may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
 Regulation outside the United States
 To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 European Union Drug Development
 In the European Union, or EU, our product candidates also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will apply in 2019 with a three-year transition period. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new regulation, which will be directly applicable in all member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For instance, the new Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
 European Union Drug Review and Approval
 To market our future products in the EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:

• | The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 34

Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA assess the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 Data and marketing exclusivity
 In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 Pediatric investigation plan
 In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all Member States of the EU and trial results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension.
 Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
 In the EEA, a medicinal product can be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in development. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 In the EEA, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, the EMA or the member state competent authorities, cannot accept another application for a marketing authorization, or grant a marketing authorization, for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for medicines that have also complied with an agreed PIP.
 This period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of “clinical superiority” by a similar medicinal product, or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a member state in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for incentives made available by the EU and its Member States to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan drugs.

Rest of World Regulation
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Coverage and reimbursement
 Successful commercialization of new drug products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for those drug products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drug products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. The availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford a drug product. Sales of drug products depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of drugs products are paid for by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors.
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular drug products. In many countries, the prices of drug products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of drug products under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control company profits. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for drug products may be reduced compared with the United States.
 In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new drug products are typically made by CMS, an agency within the HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new drug product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors and coverage and reimbursement levels for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor.
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. Any negotiated prices for any of our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
 36

For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the average manufacturer price, or AMP, and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although under the current state of the law these newly eligible entities (with the exception of children’s hospitals) will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. As 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our drug candidates, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat are the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s drug could adversely affect the sales of our drug candidate. If third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis.
 These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
 Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures.
