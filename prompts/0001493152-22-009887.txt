--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Acquire profitable waste and recycling services companies with similar or compatible and synergistic business models, that can help the Company achieve these objectives; 
● | Offer innovative recycling services that significantly reduce the disposal of plastics, electronic wastes, food wastes, and hazardous wastes in the commercial property universe; 
● | Establish partnerships with innovative universities, municipalities and companies; and 
● | Attract investment funds who will actively work with the Company to achieve these goals and help the Company grow into a leading waste and recycling services supplier in North America. 

 
Some potential merger/acquisition candidates have been identified and discussions initiated. These candidates are within the Company’s core business model, serving commercial properties, accretive to cash flow, and geographically favorable. While seeking to identify acquisition candidates, the Company seeks to identify target entities with a similar core business model or a model which naturally integrates with its own, and which are situated in opportunistic geographic locations.
 
We have unrestricted discretion in seeking and participating in a business opportunity, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors.
 
The selection of a business opportunity in which to participate is complex and risky. Additionally, we have only limited resources and may find it difficult to locate good opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire any business opportunity which will ultimately prove to be beneficial to us and our shareholders. We will select any potential business opportunity based on our management’s best business judgment.

Our activities are subject to several significant risks, which arise primarily as a result of the fact that we have no specific business and may acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management, which potentially could act without the consent, vote, or approval of our shareholders. The risks faced by us are further increased as a result of its lack of resources and our inability to provide a prospective business opportunity with significant capital.
 
Licenses:
 
None.
 
Patents/Trademarks:
 
We currently hold no patents or trademarks.
 
Research & Development
 
We had no expenses in Research and Development costs during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.


Compliance Expenses
 
Our company incurs annual expenses to comply with state corporate governance and business licensing requirements. We estimate these costs to be under $2,000 per year for the establishment of foreign corporations in other states where we plan to operate.
Labor and Other Supplies
 
We currently have one part-time and two full-time employees (executive). We also currently have seven full-time employees at Lyell Environmental Services and two part-time and one full-time at AmWaste. We contract all labor for public company governance services, website development, accounting, legal and daily activities outside of management.
Principal Products or Services and Markets
 
The principal markets for the Company’s future and recycling services will comprise property management companies, construction and demolition companies, restaurants and retail stores, industrial and manufacturing businesses, and healthcare.
Seasonality
 
The waste and recycling industry experiences little seasonal variance, and the Company does not anticipate significant seasonality in its business.
 
Leases
 
The Company anticipates its most significant lease obligations will be classified as fixed assets that will be used in the normal course of its business. Some lease obligations may include renewal or purchase options, escalation clauses, restrictions, penalties or other obligations that we will consider in determining minimum lease payments. The leases will be classified as either operating leases or capital leases, as appropriate.

Governmental Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to certain foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental, waste management, and health and safety matters. We believe we operate in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements. However, material costs and liabilities may arise from these requirements or from new, modified or more stringent requirements. Material cost may rise due to additional manufacturing cost of raw or made parts with the application of new regulations. Our liabilities may also increase due to additional regulations imposed by foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental, waste management, and health and safety matters. In addition, our past, current and future operations and those of businesses we acquire, may give rise to claims of exposure by employees or the public or to other claims or liabilities relating to environmental, waste management or health and safety concerns.
 
Our markets can be positively or negatively impacted by the effects of governmental and regulatory matters. We are affected not only by energy policy, laws, regulations and incentives of governments in the markets into which we sell, but also by rules, regulations and costs imposed by utilities. Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers on the installation of our product or the interconnection of the product with the electric grid. Further, utility companies may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site power generation, thereby reducing the electricity they take from the utility, or for having the capacity to use power from the grid for back-up or standby purposes. These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our products or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems in the future. This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and profitability potential. In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our future operations. These costs, incentives and rules are not always the same as those faced by technologies with which we compete. Additionally, reduced emissions and higher fuel efficiency could help our future customers combat the effects of global warming. Accordingly, we may benefit from increased government regulations that impose tighter emission and fuel efficiency standards.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
Upon the completion of an acquisition of a waste and recycling service business, the Company will become subject to federal, state or provincial and local environmental, health, safety and transportation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are administered by the EPA, Environment Canada, and various other federal, state, provincial and local environmental, zoning, transportation, land use, health and safety agencies in the U.S. and Canada. Many of these agencies will examine our subsidiary operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance, obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations. Because the primary mission of our business is to collect, manage and recycle waste in an environmentally sound manner, a significant portion of our capital expenditures will be related, either directly or indirectly, to supporting the Company’s subsidiary operations as they relate to compliance with federal, state, provincial and local rules.
Competition
 
We believe we are an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than we have. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.
 
In the event we are successful in an acquisition of a company in the waste management sector, we expect to encounter intense competition with large national waste management companies, counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources. The industry also includes companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management, operators of alternative disposal facilities, companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other by-products, and waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer needs. In recent years, the industry has seen some consolidation, though the industry remains intensely competitive. Operating costs, disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the areas in which we operate. The prices that we charge are determined locally, and typically vary by volume and weight, type of waste collected, treatment requirements, risk of handling or disposal, frequency of collections, distance to final disposal sites, the availability of airspace within the geographic region, labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer.
 
Competitors include: Waste Management (WM), Rubicon Global, Republic Services, Stericycle, Waste Connections, Casella Waste Systems, Bioenergy DevCo, PegEx, Recycle Track Systems and Liquid Environmental Solutions.
 
Acquisition Interest
 
In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another company or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon consummation of a transaction, it is probable that our present management and stockholders will no longer be in control of us. In addition, our sole director may, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, resign and be replaced by new directors without a vote of our stockholders, or sell his stock in us. Any such sale will only be made in compliance with the securities laws of the United States and any applicable state.

It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under application federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, as a negotiated element of the transaction, we may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. If such registration occurs, it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after it has successfully consummated a merger or acquisition and is no longer considered an inactive company.
 
The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in our securities may have a depressive effect on the value of our securities in the future. There is no assurance that such a trading market will develop.
 
While the actual terms of a transaction cannot be predicted, it is expected that the parties to any business transaction will find it desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the business transaction in a so-called “tax-free” reorganization under Sections 368(a)(1) or 351 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). In order to obtain tax-free treatment under the Code, it may be necessary for the owner of the acquired business to own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. In such event, our stockholders would retain less than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This would result in significant dilution in the equity of our stockholders.
 
As part of our investigation, we expect to meet personally with management and key personnel, visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis of verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of our limited financial resources and management expertise. The manner in which we participate in an opportunity will depend on the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of both parties, and the management of the opportunity.
 
With respect to any merger or acquisition, and depending upon, among other things, the target company’s assets and liabilities, our stockholders will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in us following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with assets and expectations of growth. Any merger or acquisition can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our stockholders.
 
We will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written business agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally we anticipate that such agreements will (i) require specific representations and warranties by all of the parties; (ii) specify certain events of default; (iii) detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing; (iv) outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with the Company’s attorneys and accountants; (v) set forth remedies on defaults; and (vi) include miscellaneous other terms.
 
As stated above, we will not acquire or merge with any entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to insure our compliance within the requirements of the 1934 Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by that business to be acquired, the definitive closing documents will provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable, at the discretion of our present management. If such transaction is voided, the definitive closing documents will also contain a provision providing for reimbursement for our costs associated with the proposed transaction.
 
Executive Employees
 
As of the date of this Report, we have one part-time employee that serves in the role of Corporate Secretary, and two full-time employees that serve in the roles of Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Operating Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. We plan to expand our management team within the next 12 months to include certain officers for any acquisitions and any new subsidiaries or operational activities management deems necessary. We consider our relations with our employees and consultants to be in good standing.
