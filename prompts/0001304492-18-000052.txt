 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Overview 
 We are a wireless communications company focused on developing and offering our spectrum assets for the deployment of next generation network and mobile communication solutions designed to meet the needs of critical infrastructure and enterprise customers.  Our Chairman, Brian McAuley, and our Chief Executive Officer, Morgan O’Brien, were the co-founders of Nextel Communications (“Nextel”) and have over 60 years of combined experience in successfully developing regulatory driven spectrum initiatives to address the unmet wireless communications needs of businesses.  
 We are the largest holder of licensed spectrum in the Part 90 900 MHz spectrum band (i.e., 896-901 MHz paired with 935-940 MHz) throughout the contiguous United States, plus Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico.  On average, we hold approximately 60% of the channels in our portion of the 900 MHz band in the top 20 metropolitan market areas in the United States.  
 As our first priority, we have initiated and are currently pursuing a regulatory proceeding at the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) aimed at modernizing and realigning the 900 MHz band to increase its usability and capacity, including for the future deployment of broadband and other advanced technologies and services.  At the same time, we are expecting to enable private broadband network solutions, leveraging our spectrum, that address the unmet needs of our targeted critical infrastructure and enterprise customers.  For our first offering, we have deployed push-to-talk (“PTT”) networks and offer our TeamConnect two-way radio service in seven major metropolitan market areas, including Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, New York and Philadelphia.  TeamConnect allows our enterprise customers to increase the productivity of their field-based workers and the efficiency of their dispatch and call center operations.  We are pursuing opportunities to enable additional network and mobile communication solutions for use by critical infrastructure and enterprise customers with our existing spectrum and currently available non-broadband technologies and, if we are successful with our FCC efforts, utilizing our spectrum assets to enable broadband and other advanced wireless service offerings.
 Our Business Strategy
 Our goal is to become the leading wireless communications company focused on developing and offering our spectrum assets and related services for the deployment of private network and mobile communication solutions dedicated to serving the needs of critical infrastructure and enterprise customers.  We intend to pursue this goal by executing on the following business strategies:
1. Increase the Efficiency and Capacity of Our Spectrum. Our spectrum is our most valuable asset. While our current licensed spectrum can support our deployment of narrowband and wideband wireless services, including our TeamConnect service, many of the future business opportunities we have identified will require contiguous spectrum that allows for greater bandwidth than the less efficient current configuration of our spectrum band. As a result, our first priority is to continue to pursue initiatives to increase the usability, efficiency and capacity of our spectrum assets. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We acquired our nationwide spectrum position from Sprint Corporation (“Sprint”) in September 2014, and shortly thereafter, petitioned the FCC to modernize the 900 MHz band to permit us and other licensees in the band to introduce new technologies, including the global mobile broadband standard of LTE, to more efficiently support the market demand for reliable, secure and dedicated high speed data, video and voice services.  Please see the section titled “Our Joint Petition for Rulemaking” below for a discussion of the status and evolution of our FCC proceeding.

2. Facilitate the Deployment of Next Generation Private Network and Mobile Communication Solutions. Complementing our pursuit of our regulatory initiatives, we are engaged in a number of business activities to prepare for the future deployment of next generation network and mobile communication solutions utilizing our current and, if we receive FCC authorization, future spectrum, including: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Identify and Evaluate Available Technologies. Currently, we can utilize our spectrum, without obtaining further regulatory authorizations or rule modifications, with existing narrowband and wideband technologies, including the technologies we are utilizing to provide our existing TeamConnect service, and services for machine-to-machine (“M2M”) and related Internet of Things (“IoT”) applications. In addition, our current licensed frequencies are located within a portion of the 900 MHz spectrum band that the FCC has designated for various land mobile radio (“LMR”) uses. Our licensed frequencies are also within the 3GPP global standard of Band 8 (also known as the E-GSM band, or 880 - 915 MHz paired with 925 - 960 MHz).  Band 8 has been internationally approved for the deployment of LTE technologies in numerous global regions, and so there is an ecosystem of existing LTE broadband devices and network components that we believe can be adapted for use on the contiguous spectrum we are seeking to create in our FCC proceeding.  We also believe that many of these devices and network components would be well suited for the work environment of our targeted critical infrastructure and enterprise customers, including network base stations, ruggedized smart phones, hardened data gateways and communications modules for IoT applications.  In our lab, we are continuing to test and evaluate the potential use of these devices and network components to assess their capabilities, functionality, pricing and any specification, modification or adaptation requirements to meet our target customers’ needs.

     Identify and Evaluate Potential Use Cases.  At the same time, our team and the key industry consultants we have retained have engaged in an intensive outreach program to potential critical infrastructure customers to identify possible use cases for our spectrum.  These activities have led to a number of discussions with prospective customers who are investigating ways to fulfill their existing and future network and mobile communication needs leveraging the benefits of our spectrum position.  
 As we expected, we identified a wide variety of both mobile and fixed use cases through these discussions that appear to be well suited to the coverage, penetration and capacity characteristics of the potential broadband spectrum allocation that we would expect to enable if we receive FCC authorization.  A number of critical infrastructure and enterprise companies have put on the record their needs and unique requirements for networks and services utilizing broadband and other next generation technologies.  
 A number of the potential critical infrastructure and enterprise customers we contacted have historically built, maintained and operated their own disparate and siloed communications networks, including private LMR and supervisory control and data acquisition (“SCADA”) networks on frequencies licensed exclusively to them by the FCC.  These entities commonly express their desire to retain the positive elements of their aging LMR and SCADA operations, namely tight control and custom features (such as specialized coverage and priority access), while adding the benefits of broadband and other advanced technologies (such as solving a broader set of use cases, providing high speed data and video services and economies of scale).  However, due to the general unavailability of low band spectrum (i.e., below 1GHz) that is not already licensed, these entities have had limited opportunities to license or acquire the spectrum required to deploy broadband and other advanced technologies on their own.  
 Without the opportunity to develop their own next generation network and mobile communication solutions, many of our potential critical infrastructure and enterprise customers are pursuing other options, including considering the services offered by Tier 1 carriers.  The large consumer-focused carriers, in two instances well exceeding a hundred million subscribers each, enjoy clear economy of scale benefits.  However, the networks designed and operated by these carriers to primarily address the needs of their consumer customers may not satisfy the highly specialized requirements of large complex business organizations.  We believe that security, priority access, latency, redundancy control and unique coverage requirements are just some of the reasons critical infrastructure and large enterprises would be interested in obtaining (either as a licensee or customer) the private network and mobile communications solutions that can be enabled through use of our spectrum if we receive FCC authorization.  
 In mid-April 2018, we met with the FCC, together with representatives of Ameren Services Company, an affiliate of Ameren Corporation, a holding company for electric and gas utilities located in the Midwestern U.S., to support Ameren’s request for experimental authority from the FCC to test broadband operations utilizing our 900 MHz spectrum in the requested geographic areas.  Following this meeting, the FCC granted Ameren’s request for experimental authority and we are currently supporting Ameren’s broadband trialing activities utilizing a 1.4 X 1.4 MHz 900 MHz broadband spectrum allocation in geographic areas in several Ameren markets located in Illinois and Missouri.
 We also are continuing active discussions with our potential critical infrastructure and enterprise customers to better understand their requirements and determine how the 900 MHz broadband spectrum allocation we are pursuing with our FCC initiatives can be used to support broadband wireless network and communications solutions, utilizing current and future technologies, to meet their needs.  For example, we are currently exploring the development of a 900 MHz virtualized LTE and 5G network solution that could address the needs and use cases of our potential customers.  This approach could empower our critical infrastructure and enterprise customers to create and implement their own virtual private network and mobile communications services from a secure hosted cloud environment.  This approach could allow these entities to effectively keep pace with the evolution of mobile technologies and develop new services to offer to their customers, while leveraging the efficiencies of shared resources.
 Continue to Identify and Evaluate New Opportunities. The wireless communications industry is highly competitive, and subject to rapid regulatory, technological and market changes.  A key part of our business strategy is to continually monitor changes in the wireless industry, and evaluate how these changes could enable us to maximize the use of our spectrum assets.  For example, recent FCC decisions have created significant opportunities for blocks of shared, unlicensed spectrum, both below 1 GHz to a limited extent and, in very large amounts, above 1 GHz.  While we intend to build our existing and future business strategies around our 900 MHz licensed spectrum, our ability to combine our licensed 900 MHz spectrum with additional spectrum in one or more unlicensed bands could provide us with a chance to offer potential customers the best of both worlds.  On the one hand, our licensed 900 MHz spectrum offers the assurance of absolute control over access to and use of that spectrum, allowing our spectrum to be utilized to provide customers with guaranteed levels of service and the ability to prescribe and enforce purpose-built “rules of the road” for the provision of those services.  On the other hand, the addition of unlicensed spectrum, particularly in large swaths that support very high speed services, could bring capacity and capabilities that exceed the limits of our licensed spectrum.  As a result, we are evaluating potential combinations of unlicensed spectrum with our 900 MHz licensed spectrum to enable the combined spectrum to be utilized to provide optimum services to critical infrastructure and enterprise companies.
 As another example, we are exploring potential opportunities to provide IoT services.  Our team, assisted by our industry consultants, is evaluating the many ways we could potentially address future IoT opportunities.  In particular, we are focusing on opportunities related to modernization of the utility smart grid, including field area networks, sensors and meters and similar end-point devices that may perform best on a private wireless network.  Although these activities, and the precise contours of specific IoT business opportunities, remain in the very preliminary stages, we are orienting our efforts in this area around identifying those customers who would likely place the highest value on obtaining services from a private wireless carrier dedicated to their needs.

3. Continue to Leverage the Experience and Relationships of Our Executive Team. Our senior executive team has a long, proven track record in the network and mobile communications industry. Brian McAuley and Morgan O’Brien, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, respectively, were the co-founders of Nextel. At Nextel, they were responsible for developing and operating the first all-digital nationwide wireless network that brought PTT to the mass business market. Nextel built its business by identifying an underserved market segment, and despite the competition, creating a better solution for potential customers in this market segment. After growing the total number of subscribers to approximately 23 million, Nextel merged with Sprint in August 2005 at a stand-alone value of approximately $36 billion. Mr. McAuley went on to found NeoWorld Communications in 1999, which was subsequently purchased by Nextel in 2003. In addition, several members of our current management team held leadership roles at Nextel. We intend to leverage the experience of our executive team to refine and execute on our business strategy, to achieve our regulatory spectrum goals and to identify and pursue business opportunities involving use of our spectrum assets to enable next generation network and mobile communications solutions for critical infrastructure and enterprise customers.

  Our Joint Petition for Rulemaking.  
 FCC Proceeding. In November 2014, we and the Enterprise Wireless Alliance (“EWA”) submitted a Joint Petition for Rulemaking (the “Joint Petition”) to the FCC to propose the realignment of a portion of the 900 MHz band from narrowband to broadband.  We welcomed EWA’s partnership because of its multi-decade role as a trade association representing the spectrum interests of a broad range of business enterprise, critical infrastructure and commercial service providers.  We and EWA believe this realignment is consistent with the FCC’s mandate to promote more efficient use of limited spectrum resources generally and its ongoing efforts to make more spectrum available for broadband services specifically, particularly in the spectrum bands below 1 GHz.  In response to the Joint Petition, the FCC issued a public notice requesting comments from interested parties and asked a number of questions about the proposal. A number of parties, including several incumbent licensees, filed comments with the FCC expressing their views, including both support and opposition.  Some raised technical and other questions about the proposal.  In May 2015, we and the EWA filed proposed rules with the FCC related to our Joint Petition.  Comments on the proposed rules were filed in June 2015 and reply comments in July 2015. The proposed rules outlined our recommended procedural and technical operating parameters, including field strength limits, processes related to the administration and sequencing of the proposed realignment of the 900 MHz band, and requirements for the broadband operators to provide comparable facilities to incumbent licensees, to pay the cost of their realignment, and to utilize an emission mask with advanced filtering capability specifically designed to protect licensees adjacent to the proposed broadband portion of the 900 MHz band.   
 On August 4, 2017, the FCC issued a Notice of Inquiry (“NOI”) that we believe signified the FCC’s interest in conducting a serious and comprehensive evaluation of the current and future rules governing the 900 MHz band.  In the NOI, the FCC announced that it had commenced a proceeding to examine whether it would be in the public interest to change the existing rules governing the 900 MHz band to enable increased access to spectrum, improved spectrum efficiency and expanded flexibility for a variety of potential uses and applications, including broadband and other advanced technologies and services.  The FCC stated that the purpose of the NOI was to gather information from interested parties to assist the FCC in its decision-making process.  The FCC requested interested parties, including us, to comment on a number of questions related to three potential options for the 900 MHz band: (i) retaining the current configuration of the 900 MHz band, but increasing operational flexibility, (ii) reconfiguring a portion or all of the 900 MHz band to support broadband and other advanced technologies and services or (iii) retaining the current 900 MHz band licensing and eligibility rules.  Because the FCC requested information on multiple options for the 900 MHz band, the NOI effectively superseded the Joint Petition and other pending proposals that involved the 900 MHz band.  However, a broadband reconfiguration option included in the NOI was consistent with our Joint Petition proposal, and all information we previously provided to the FCC to support the realignment and modernization of the 900 MHz band remained relevant. We and EWA filed a joint response to the FCC’s NOI on October 2, 2017 and reply comments on November 1, 2017.  
 On May 1, 2018, we and the EWA augmented elements of our initial joint response to the NOI based on our discussions and interactions with incumbents and other interested parties to the NOI proceeding.   This filing was intended to address and resolve issues and concerns expressed by incumbents in and adjacent to the portion of the 900 MHz band proposed for broadband use. Our most recent responsive filing also proposed a means to increase the alternatives through which licenses for a new 3 X 3 900 MHz broadband service could be put to use by utilities and other members of the critical infrastructure industry, as well as by other private enterprise companies.  We believe these alternatives add elements of flexibility and, ideally, could shorten the time required to introduce important broadband communication capabilities to these market segments.
 Specifically, our most recent responsive filing proposes that: (i) during the first year after FCC adoption of the relevant licensing rules, utilities and other Business/Industrial/Land Transportation (“B/ILT”) applicants would have the exclusive opportunity to secure Private Enterprise Broadband (“PEBB”) licenses, and could utilize the traditional frequency coordination process to do so, based on acquiring control of the requisite 240 discrete 900 MHz channels (the number of channels equivalent to a 3 X 3 MHz broadband allocation) through combining any of their own licensed channels with any they might purchase or lease from third party licensees and those they might be assigned from available FCC channel inventory; (ii) successful applicants then could obtain frequency coordinator approval to exchange such channels for a 3 X 3 MHz PEBB license to be issued by the FCC, which could be deployed, operated and maintained, in accordance with applicable service rules, either solely by the applicant licensee, or with the assistance and/or participation of third parties; and (iii) the coverage territory for such a PEBB license would correspond (a) in urbanized areas (defined to be the top 306 Cellular Market Areas, or “CMAs”), to a metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) and (b) in 

 
 Page 4

 
     non-urbanized areas (the remaining CMAs) to individual counties, which we believe, in each case, represent geographic areas that will more closely match up with the service territories of most utilities and the areas of business focus for other private enterprises.  In addition, our most recent responsive filing proposes shifting the contemplated 3 X 3 MHz broadband allocation 400 kHz down to a new location in the 900 MHz band, a change that has addressed the concern regarding potential interference previously expressed by incumbents in the narrowband PCS spectrum immediately above the top end of our portion of the 900 MHz band.  It also will allow for greater separation between any co-located frequencies in narrowband systems.     We have responded to all outstanding requests for information from the FCC, and we are currently awaiting FCC action.  Based on our discussions with the staff of the FCC, we believe that the proceeding is under active consideration.  The FCC’s next step could be the issuance of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking based on the NOI and the record developed in response to it, a request for additional information, a decision to close the proceeding without further action, or some other action, and the timing of any such next step also remains uncertain.  Moreover, certain of the matters proposed in our most recent responsive filing are contingent on other developments, such as formalizing our tentative agreement with the Association of American Railroads to exchange their frequencies, some of which are located immediately below the lower end of the originally proposed 900 MHz broadband allocation, for our frequencies further down in the 900 MHz band, to accommodate the proposed 400 kHz shift of that allocation.  In addition, all aspects of potential changes in the configuration and/or use of frequencies in the 900 MHz band remain subject to necessary FCC approvals.  
 We continue to believe in the merits of our broadband approach, and that it would be in the public interest for the FCC to realign the 900 MHz band to enable broadband and other advanced technologies and services.  Nevertheless, obtaining a favorable result from the FCC may take a significant amount of time and resources. Moreover, there is no assurance that following the conclusion of the NOI process, the FCC will ultimately propose and adopt rules that will allow utilization of our licensed 900 MHz spectrum to offer broadband and other advanced technologies and services. 
 The full text of the NOI, further comments and related correspondence are available on the FCC’s public website at https://www.fcc.gov/document/900-mhz-notice-inquiry, and our filed comments and responses, as well as those of others submitting comments and/or responses in the NOI proceeding, also are available on the FCC’s public website.
  Meetings with Incumbents. To prepare for the filings we have submitted with the FCC and to build support for a 900 MHz broadband realignment, we have met, and intend to continue to meet, with a number of incumbent licensees, critical infrastructure businesses and other interested parties in the 900 MHz band. We have provided business proposals to several incumbents to assist with their communication needs. The goals of these discussions have been: (i) building consensus for the proposed reconfiguration of the 900 MHz band to support broadband and other advanced technologies and services; (ii) resolving any technology or other concerns raised by incumbent licensees; (iii) educating critical infrastructure businesses on how broadband capabilities could enhance their operations and initiatives (for example, supporting grid modernization requirements or monitoring and/or controlling their own system or network elements via machine-to-machine type services); (iv) gaining a better understanding of the size of the operational incumbent base and the nature of the systems they are currently operating; (v) to refine and modify aspects of our proposal to seek to minimize potential concerns and problems expressed by certain incumbents; (vi) to gain additional support for that proposal (as so refined and modified); (vii) to accelerate the availability of a sub-1 GHz broadband spectrum allocation for use in a private network context designed to meet the specialized requirements of utilities, other critical infrastructure industry members and private enterprise users; and (viii) evaluating and  proposing voluntary license relocation opportunities to certain incumbent licensees. With certain incumbent licensees, we are continuing to attempt to build consensus and to resolve any concerns they have expressed regarding our broadband initiatives; with others, we are soliciting their support and cooperation to structure and implement mutually beneficial relocations; and with select critical infrastructure enterprises, we are jointly investigating how the future broadband capabilities that we envision could be employed to meet their anticipated needs and future operating plans. 
 A number of critical infrastructure and enterprise companies have put on the record their needs and unique requirements for networks and services utilizing broadband and other next generation technologies. We anticipate that the NOI proceeding will continue to afford other companies with the opportunity to put similar use case requirements on the record. Additionally, on May 24, 2018, Sensus USA, Inc. filed a comment with the FCC in the NOI proceeding expressing its support for the responsive filing that we and the EWA submitted on May 1, 2018.  Previously, Sensus had been one of our most vocal and persistent opponents.
 Technology Evaluation.  Our engineering team has also evaluated the technical requirements for both current narrowband and wideband solutions, as well as future broadband technologies in the 900 MHz band.  Based on these evaluations, we believe a broadband network can be deployed utilizing the 900 MHz band with technologies that are commercially available.  
 Acquiring Spectrum Assets.  In addition, we have completed a limited number of spectrum acquisitions to support our realignment efforts and the utilization of our spectrum assets to enable future broadband networks.  We have prioritized, and intend to continue to prioritize, our acquisitions of spectrum licenses, including Specialized Mobile Radio (“SMR”) blocks and site-specific licenses, in major metropolitan areas that we believe will ease the process of realigning a portion of the 900 MHz spectrum from narrowband to broadband, assuming the FCC approves our broadband initiatives. To date, we have pursued these acquisitions opportunistically and selectively to avoid unduly increasing the cost of the spectrum licenses we acquire.

     Our Spectrum Assets 
 We are the largest holder of FCC licenses in the Part 90 900 MHz band, with a nationwide footprint in the contiguous United States, plus Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico.  We acquired our 900 MHz spectrum and certain related equipment from Sprint in September 2014 for $100 million, which we paid in the form of $90 million in cash and $10 million in shares of our common stock.  We estimate that we acquired our 900 MHz spectrum for approximately $0.06 per MHz for each person (“MHz/Pop”) in our licensed market areas and we continue to invest in spectrum that we expect to increase in value.
 The FCC has allocated approximately 10 MHz of spectrum in our portion of the Part 90 900 MHz band, sub-divided into 40, 10-channel blocks of contiguous channels alternating between blocks designated for operation of SMR commercial systems and blocks designated for B/ILT users, with FCC rules also enabling B/ILT licenses to be converted to SMR use.  Subsequently, the FCC conducted overlay auctions on the SMR designated blocks that awarded geographic based licenses on a Major Trading Area (“MTA”) basis while affording operational protection to incumbent, site-based licensees in those areas. The 20 blocks of B/ILT channels have not been auctioned and all licenses in those blocks remain site-based.
 We hold, on average, approximately 60% of the total number of 900 MHz SMR and B/ILT channels in the top 20 metropolitan markets in the United States, which includes approximately 70% of the U.S. population. We also hold almost every 900 MHz SMR MTA geographic license in all but a few markets in the United States, as well as certain B/ILT and converted B/ILT licenses in most major markets.  As a result, we hold on average, 240 of the 399 total channels in this 10 MHz portion of the 900 MHz band in the top 20 metropolitan markets in the United States. 
 Our TeamConnect Business
 In Fiscal 2016, we began offering our commercial PTT service, which we market as TeamConnect, in seven major metropolitan areas throughout the United States, including Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, New York and Philadelphia.  We developed TeamConnect to address the needs of enterprises that value a tailored PTT solution addressing the management of their mobile workforce. TeamConnect includes features that allow communications between PTT radios on our MOTOTRBO networks and smartphones or tablets operating on any cellular carrier network, and that permit, through our TeamConnect Hub functionality, any computer connected to the internet to use its browser as a dispatch control center.  The operation of our TeamConnect business is separate from, and not contingent on, the initiatives we are pursuing at the FCC or our other spectrum-related activities.
 Our TeamConnect Service.  Our TeamConnect service combines pdvConnect, our proprietary suite of mobile communication and workforce management applications, with state-of-the-art digital network architecture and mobile devices supplied by Motorola Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Motorola”). pdvConnect is an efficient mobile communication and workforce management solution that enables businesses to locate and communicate with their field workers and improve the documentation of work events and job status.  TeamConnect gives customers the ability to instantly set up PTT communications within their calling area with just the touch of a “button.”  It delivers real-time information from mobile workers to dispatch operators.  TeamConnect allows customers to deliver voice messages to any computer (via the internet), any email address or to any phone in the U.S., as well as to communicate in real time with TeamConnect enabled smartphones on any cellular carrier network.
 Because our mobile workforce applications are cloud-based, there is no requirement for our customers to download software to their two-way radios before beginning to use TeamConnect.  We offer customers our TeamConnect service at a monthly price that we believe is competitive with the monthly price that they would pay for comparable services.
 Sales and Marketing. We primarily offer our TeamConnect service to customers indirectly through third-party sales representatives who are primarily from Motorola’s nationwide dealer network and select other third-party wireless dealers.  We historically supported our indirect sales representatives by providing them with training, sales, marketing and advertising support from our internal sales and marketing team.  We also historically supported our indirect sales representatives by placing a dealer manager in each market in which we operate.  We selected this approach of utilizing existing wireless dealers, to serve as our indirect sales representatives, based on our belief that it would enable us to develop a presence in our markets and help to reduce the costs of maintaining a nationwide sales and distribution network.  We normally enter into contracts directly with end users of our TeamConnect communications solutions, including those introduced to us through our indirect dealer network. 
  We market our cloud-based mobile workforce applications package, pdvConnect, primarily through two Tier 1 carriers in the United States. We previously also marketed pdvConnect through an international Tier 1 carrier in Mexico until our agreement with this carrier ended during the second quarter of Fiscal 2016. We have entered into standard reseller, co-marketing and license agreements with these third-party Tier 1 carriers. Our Tier 1 carrier partners market pdvConnect as an available application to complement their wireless service offerings. Generally, pdvConnect has been offered at a monthly price of up to $19.99 per user. For the year ended March 31, 2018, our operating revenues were derived entirely from domestic sales. Revenues from the two domestic carriers accounted for 39% and 4%, respectively, of our total operating revenues for Fiscal 2018. 
 To date, sales of our TeamConnect service have been significantly slower to ramp-up than our initial expectations for a number of reasons, including but not limited to, the performance of our indirect third-party sales representatives, longer initial sales

     cycles, high device costs, improvements in competitive PTT solutions and coverage gaps in certain markets due to delays in our deployment of planned sites.  
 Recent Developments. On June 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved an initial plan to restructure our business aimed at reducing the future operating costs of our TeamConnect and pdvConnect businesses and better aligning and focusing our business priorities on our spectrum initiatives, including increasing the efficiency and capacity of our spectrum to enable the future deployment of broadband and other advanced technologies and services.  As part of the restructuring plan, we eliminated approximately 20 positions, or 20% of our workforce, primarily from our TeamConnect and pdvConnect businesses.  In addition, we received information from one of our Tier 1 carrier partners that the largest customer of our pdvConnect service planned to discontinue its use of that service during Fiscal 2019.  The revenues we generated from this customer were $2.4 million, $1.8 million, and $1.4 million for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, which represented 37%, 37% and 38% of our total operating revenues for those same fiscal years, respectively.    Our Board of Directors and management team have commenced a comprehensive review and assessment of our existing TeamConnect business in our initial seven markets, its prospects both as a stand-alone business and as a complementary business to potential future 900 MHz broadband network deployments in those markets and whether it continues to be in the best interests of pdvWireless and its stockholders to actively pursue these business opportunities, especially in light of the Company’s focus on its spectrum initiatives and its recent progress with obtaining support from incumbents who had previously opposed the Company’s position. During this evaluation process, we will continue to operate our TeamConnect service in our seven existing markets and will continue to offer our pdvConnect service through our two Tier 1 carrier partners in the United States.   Our Competition 
 The market for network and mobile communication solutions for enterprises has been and will continue to be characterized by intense competition on the basis of price, performance, technology advances and the features, functionality, quality and reliability of the offered services and products.  With respect to our TeamConnect business, we compete with the wireless Tier 1 carriers.  Most of these competitors offer some form of PTT service, along with a selection of mobile resource management solutions.  In addition to the Tier 1 carriers, our TeamConnect business also competes with local SMR and other dispatch service providers who offer PTT services to our targeted dispatch-centric business market verticals.  With respect to our broadband and other spectrum initiatives, we compete with the Tier 1 carriers, local SMR operators and other public and private companies that are in the business of acquiring and developing spectrum assets.  In addition, our broadband initiatives are opposed by certain incumbents and other third parties with conflicting business interests.  Many of the third parties who offer communication solutions for critical infrastructure and other enterprise companies or with whom we compete for spectrum opportunities have more resources, longer operating histories, larger sales and marketing teams and greater political and regulatory influence than we do. Our Significant Business Relationships
 Sprint. In May 2014, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of Sprint (the “Sprint APA”) to acquire: (i) FCC licenses to operate a nationwide dispatch network in the 900 MHz band and (ii) certain 900 MHz equipment. We paid Sprint an aggregate of $100 million for these assets, consisting of $90 million in cash and $10 million in shares of our common stock at a price equal to $20.00 per share. In September 2014, we obtained the necessary approvals from the FCC to transfer the FCC licenses from Sprint to us, and we then completed the closing of the purchase and sales of the spectrum assets.
 Motorola. We signed a reseller agreement with Motorola pursuant to which we agreed to purchase, and Motorola agreed to supply us with, the Motorola digital technology we are utilizing to deploy our PTT network and the mobile handsets and devices we are offering to our customers on that network.  Additionally, Motorola invested $10 million in our subsidiary, PDV Spectrum Holding Company, LLC, that we formed to hold our 900 MHz spectrum licenses.  Motorola’s ownership interest in our subsidiary is convertible, at the option of either Motorola or us, into shares of our common stock at a price equal to $20.00 per share. Motorola is not entitled to any profits, dividends or other distribution from the operations of our subsidiary. 
 In addition, we entered into a lease agreement with Motorola pursuant to in which our subsidiary agreed to lease a portion of our 900 MHz licenses in exchange for an upfront, fully-paid lease fee of $7.5 million. Under the terms of this lease agreement with Motorola, Motorola can use the leased channels to provide narrowband services to certain qualified end-users. The end-users can only use the leased channels for their own internal communication purposes. The end-users cannot sublease the channels to any other end-users or to any commercial radio system operations or carriers. The lease agreement specifically states that the channels leased to Motorola will not be used in a manner that would be competitive with our services and limits the total number of channels that Motorola can lease in any market area. The lease agreement provides us with flexibility regarding the future use and management of our spectrum, including setting forth relocation and repurposing policies for or affecting the leased channels, which policies are designed to facilitate any necessary re-alignment of frequencies that may be associated with our efforts to assemble contiguous spectrum for broadband uses.

     Motorola cannot enter contracts with end-users after December 31, 2020 involving new leases of spectrum from us without our consent and the payment of an additional fee. The initial lease period for any end-user cannot last more than seven years, and the lease can only be renewed for up to three years for an aggregate lease period of up to 10 years.  In addition, we agreed to purchase equipment manufactured by Motorola for any future 900 MHz broadband network we deploy, provided that Motorola makes reasonable efforts to ensure the equipment meets our required sourcing criteria.  Our Intellectual Property
 To establish and protect our proprietary technologies and service offerings, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade-secret laws, as well as confidentiality provisions in our contracts. We have implemented a patent strategy designed to protect our pdvConnect and TeamConnect technologies and facilitate the commercialization of our service offerings. Currently, our patent portfolio is comprised of seven issued U.S. patents, two issued European patents and two issued Canadian patents, all of which have been assigned to and are owned by us. In addition, we have several trademarks and service marks to protect our corporate name, services offerings, goodwill and brand. There are currently no claims or litigation regarding these trademarks, patents, copyrights, or service marks. We also rely on trade-secret protection of our intellectual property. We enter into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants when appropriate.  The Regulation of Our Business
 The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, operation and acquisition of our wireless operations and wireless spectrum holdings in the United States.  We hold FCC spectrum licenses in the 900 MHz band as a non-interconnected, non-common carrier SMR service provider.  As such, within the limitations of our spectrum holdings and available technology, we are authorized by the FCC to provide non-interconnected mobile communications services, including two-way radio dispatch, and mobile data and internet services.  
 Licensing. We are entitled to provide our wireless communication services on specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and in doing so must comply with the rules, regulations and policies adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each spectrum license for a fixed period of time, typically 10 years in the case of the FCC licenses we currently hold. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses held by operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if it determines that a license renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such non-compliance is unintentional. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and FCC rules and regulations require us to obtain the FCC’s prior approval before assigning or transferring control of wireless licenses, with limited exceptions.  The FCC’s rules and regulations also govern spectrum lease arrangements for a range of wireless radio service licenses, including the licenses we hold. These same requirements apply to any licenses or leases we may wish to enter into, transfer or acquire as part of our broadband initiatives.  The FCC may prohibit or impose conditions on any proposed acquisitions, sales or other transfers of control of licenses or leases. The FCC engages in a case-by-case review of transactions that involve the consolidation or sale of spectrum licenses or leases and may apply a spectrum “screen” in examining such transactions. Because an FCC license is necessary to lawfully provide the wireless services we currently offer and plan to offer or to enable, if the FCC were to disapprove any such request to acquire, assign or otherwise transfer a license or lease, our business plans would be adversely affected. Approval from the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, as well as state or local regulatory authorities, also may be required if we sell or acquire spectrum. 
 900 MHz Band Spectrum Reconfiguration. FCC approval will be required to allow repurposing of 900 MHz spectrum from narrowband to broadband and to allow the realignment of the 900 MHz spectrum so that it is capable of supporting the LTE technology consistent with our long-range broadband initiatives. A decision by the FCC declining to permit the needed spectrum repurposing and subsequent realignment activities could have a significant adverse effect on the value of our spectrum and on our future plans for the utilization of that spectrum to enable broadband and other advanced technologies and services. 
 FCC Regulations. The FCC does not currently regulate rates for services offered by wireless providers.  However, we may be subject to other FCC regulations that impose obligations on wireless providers, such as federal Universal Service Fund obligations, which require communications providers to contribute to a fund that supports subsidized communications services to underserved areas and users; rules governing billing, subscriber privacy and customer proprietary network information; roaming obligations; rules that require wireless service providers to configure their networks to facilitate electronic surveillance by law enforcement officials; rules governing spam, telemarketing and truth-in-billing; and rules requiring us to offer equipment and services that are accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, among others. There are also pending proceedings that may affect spectrum aggregation limits and/or adjustment of the FCC’s case-by-case spectrum screens; regulation surrounding the deployment of advanced wireless broadband infrastructure; the imposition of text-to-911 capabilities; and the transition to IP networks, among others. Some of these requirements and pending proceedings (of which the foregoing examples are not an exhaustive list) pose technical and operational challenges to which we, and the industry as a whole, have not yet developed clear solutions. We are unable to predict how these pending or future FCC proceedings may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our failure to comply with any applicable FCC regulations could subject us to significant fines or forfeitures.

     State and Local Regulation. In addition to FCC regulation, we are subject to certain state regulatory requirements. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, preempts state and local regulation of the entry of, or the rates charged by, any wireless provider. State and local governments are permitted to manage public rights of way and can require fair and reasonable compensation from wireless providers for use of those rights of way so long as the compensation required is publicly disclosed by the government. The siting of base stations also remains subject to some degree of control by state and local jurisdiction. States also may impose competitively neutral requirements that, among other things, are necessary for universal service or to defray the costs of state E911 services programs, to protect the public safety and welfare, and to safeguard the rights of customers. 
 Tower Siting. Although we currently lease tower space from third parties in connection with deploying and operating our PTT network, if, in the future, we chose to deploy broadband facilities on tower facilities that we build or operate, we will be required to comply with various federal, state and local regulations that govern the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennas, including requirements imposed by the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”). Federal rules subject certain tower site locations to extensive zoning, environmental and historic preservation requirements and mandate consultation with various parties, including State and Tribal Historic Preservation Offices, which can make it more difficult and expensive to deploy facilities. The FCC antenna structure registration process also imposes public notice requirements when plans are made for construction of, or modification to, antenna structures that require FAA approval, potentially adding to the delays and burdens associated with tower siting, including potential challenges from special interest groups. To the extent governmental agencies continue to impose additional requirements like this on the tower siting process, the time and cost to construct towers could be negatively impacted. The FCC has, however, imposed a tower siting “shot clock” that requires local authorities to address tower applications within a specific timeframe, which can assist carriers in more rapid deployment of towers.  More recently, the FCC also has initiated proceedings in which it is examining means to accelerate broadband deployment by removing barriers to infrastructure investment. 
 Motor Vehicle Restrictions. A number of states and localities have banned or are considering banning or restricting the use of wireless handsets and devices while driving a motor vehicle, which in many instances could include the use of PTT devices. Such bans could cause a decline in the number of minutes of use by business customers or make our service less attractive to certain potential subscribers. 
 Electronic Surveillance. We may be required by law to provide certain surveillance capabilities to law enforcement agencies. If required, we intend to deliver the requisite surveillance capabilities to law enforcement with respect to our PTT service. 
 National Security. National security and disaster recovery issues continue to receive attention at the federal, state and local levels. For example, Congress is expected to again consider cyber security legislation to increase the security and resiliency of the nation’s digital infrastructure. In 2013, the President issued an executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies to take a number of steps to improve the security of the nation’s critical infrastructure. The details surrounding the implementation of this order have not been resolved, however, and we cannot predict the cost or other impacts of such measures. Moreover, the FCC continues to examine issues of network resiliency and reliability and may seek to impose additional regulations designed to reduce the severity and length of disruptions in communications. 
 Our Employees
 As of March 31, 2018, we had 98 full-time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  We believe that our relationship with our employees is positive. 
 As discussed above, on June 1, 2018, our Board approved an initial plan to restructure our TeamConnect and pdvConnect, businesses.  As part of the restructuring plan, we eliminated approximately 20 positions, or 20% of our workforce. Affected employees are eligible to receive severance payments based on their level within the organization and years of service, contingent upon an affected employee’s execution (and non-revocation) of a separation agreement, which includes a general release of claims against the Company.
