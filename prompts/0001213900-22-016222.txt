Item 1. BUSINESS.
Overview



We are incorporated in the state of Nevada. Prior to the consummation of the Merger as of December 31, 2020, as more specifically described below, Joway Health Industries Group Inc. (the “Company” or “Joway Health”), through its operating entities in China, was engaged in the manufacture, distribution and sales of tourmaline-related healthcare products.



As a result of the consummation of the Merger on December 31, 2020, we became a shell company and as of the date of this Annual Report, we have no full time employees. Starting from January 1, 2021, we no longer have any assets or any business operations. The Report of our independent registered public accountants on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 states that these conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.



On November 20, 2020, Joway Health entered into a Merger Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with Dynamic Elite International Limited, a British Virgin Islands company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Dynamic Elite”), Crystal Globe Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (“Parent”) and Joway Merger Subsidiary Limited, a British Virgin Islands company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Dynamic Elite (the “Merger”), with Dynamic Elite continuing as the surviving corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The special committee of the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.



Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) and as a result of the Merger, the ordinary shares of common stock of Dynamic Elite issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, all of which are held by the Company, were cancelled and extinguished in consideration for $119,070 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”). The Company distributed the Merger Consideration to its shareholders (other than to Parent) in an amount equal to such shareholder’s proportionate share of the Merger Consideration based on such shareholders’ percentage of the outstanding common stock of the Company. In addition, the Company received a fairness opinion from an investment banker opining that the Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the shareholders of the Company.



As of December 31, 2020, the Effective Time of the Merger, the 10,000 ordinary shares of common stock of Dynamic Elite issued and outstanding immediately which were held by the Company, were cancelled for $119,070 in cash as Merger Consideration, or $0.45 per share. In January 2021, the Company had received $119,070 from Crystal Globe and distributed proportionately to the Company’s minority shareholders, other than Crystal Globe, which represented 2,646,000 shares of our common stock. Since the remaining 17,408,000 shares of our common stock was owned by Crystal Globe, the $0.045 per share payment for the 17,408,000 shares was offset and Crystal Globe did not receive any cash payment in connection with the Merger.



Change in Control



On February 3, 2022, the Company consummated the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of January 31, 2022 (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and among the Company, Crystal Globe and JHP Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Buyer”), pursuant to which the Buyer purchased 16,644,820 shares of common stock of the Company from Crystal Globe. The shares represent 83% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company on a fully diluted basis. The purchase price for the shares paid by the Buyer was $100,000. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, each of Crystal Globe, the Buyer and Company made customary representations and warranties to each other. The parties agreed to certain customary post-closing covenants, including those relating to confidentiality, publicity and litigation support. The Company and Crystal Globe also agreed to certain indemnification provisions as they pertain to the Buyer for breaches or inaccuracies in their respective representations and warranties or covenants.



In connection with the acquisition of the 83% by the Buyer, Jinghe Zhang, the sole officer and director of the Company, resigned and the Buyer appointed Ramon Lata as the sole officer and director of the Company. The executive officers of the Company are currently located at 600 South 3rd Street, Las Vegas, Nevada 89101.

Shell Company Status



As a result of the consummation of the Merger, as of December 31, 2020, the Company became a shell company, as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Going forward, our main business operations consist of seeking a business combination with a private entity whose business would present an opportunity for its shareholders.



Our objectives discussed below are extremely general and are not intended to restrict discretion of our Board of Directors to search for and enter into potential business opportunities or to reject any such opportunities.



We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. Further, we may acquire or combine with a venture that is in its preliminary or early stages of development, one that is already in operation, or one that is in a more mature stage of its corporate existence. Accordingly, business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex.



We believe that there are numerous companies seeking the perceived benefits of a publicly registered corporation. These benefits are commonly thought to include the following:




● | the ability to use registered securities to acquire assets or businesses; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | increased visibility in the marketplace; 
● | greater ease of borrowing from financial institutions; 
● | improved stock trading efficiency 
● | greater shareholder liquidity; 
● | greater ease in subsequently raising capital; 
● | ability to compensate key employees through stock options and other equity awards; 
● | enhanced corporate image; and 
● | a presence in the United States capital markets. 




It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of a transaction, we may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in our securities may have a depressive effect on that market.



With respect to any merger or acquisition, negotiations with target company management are expected to focus on the percentage of our company that the target company shareholders would acquire in exchange for all of their shareholdings in the target company. Depending upon, among other things, the target company’s assets and liabilities, our existing shareholders will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in our company following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership of our existing shareholders may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with substantial assets. Any merger or acquisition effected by us can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our shareholders at such time.

We will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require certain representations and warranties of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing, will outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with our attorneys and accountants, and will include miscellaneous other terms.



It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in our loss of the related costs incurred.



Competition



We expect to encounter substantial competition in our efforts to identify and consummate a transaction with a business opportunity. The primary competition will be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, small venture capital partnerships and corporations, small business investment companies and wealthy individuals, all of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.
Employees



We presently have no employees apart from Ramon Lata, our sole officer and director. Mr. Lata is engaged in outside business activities and anticipates that he will devote to our business limited time until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.



We intend to hire additional management and other support personnel when we have reached a point in our proposed growth that would allow for such employment. In the interim, we will rely upon consultants to assist us in identifying and investigating acquisition opportunities.



Reports to Security Holders



We file annual, quarterly and current reports and other information with the SEC. You may read and copy any reports, statement or other information that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.
