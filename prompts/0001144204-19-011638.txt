Overview
 
Cision (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is a leading global provider of public relations (“PR”) software, media distribution, media intelligence and related professional services, according to Burton-Taylor International Consulting LLC, as measured by total revenue. PR and communications professionals use our products and services to help manage, execute and measure their strategic PR and communications programs. Similar to Bloomberg for finance professionals, LinkedIn for HR professionals, and Salesforce for sales professionals, we believe that we are an industry-standard SaaS solution for PR and marketing professionals and are deeply embedded in industry workflow.
 
We deliver a sophisticated, easy-to-use platform for communicators to reach relevant media influencers and craft compelling campaigns that impact customer behavior. With rich monitoring and analytics, Cision Communications CloudTM (“C3”), a cloud-based platform that integrates each of our point solutions into a single unified interface, arms brands with the insights they need to link their earned media to strategic business objectives, while aligning it with owned and paid channels. This platform enables companies and brands to build consistent, meaningful and enduring relationships with influencers and buyers in order to amplify their marketplace influence. We have more than 75,000 customers and an expansive global reach, spanning many international markets around the globe including Canada, China, India, EMEA and Latin America. Our total international sales across all countries accounted for 40% of our 2018 revenue.
 
We have undergone a strategic transformation since GTCR’s initial investment in 2014, evolving into a PR and marketing software leader through a series of complementary acquisitions. The acquisitions of Cision and Vocus, Inc. (“Vocus”) in 2014 and their subsequent merger established the foundation of the core media database, monitoring and analysis business. Over the 12 months following this initial merger, we acquired Discovery Group Holdings Ltd. (“Gorkana”) to expand our global footprint and also completed acquisitions of Visible, Inc. (“Visible”) and Viralheat, Inc. (“Viralheat”) to enhance our social media functionality. The subsequent acquisition of PRN Group (“PR Newswire”) in 2016 added the depth and breadth of a global distribution network and making us, we believe, to be the only vendor with a comprehensive global solution for PR professionals. Following these acquisitions, in October 2016, we introduced our C3 platform. In the first quarter of 2017, we acquired Bulletin Intelligence, LLC, Bulletin News Network, LLC and Bulletin News Investment, LLC (collectively, “Bulletin Intelligence”) to expand our capability to provide expert-curated executive briefings for the Executive Office of the President and corporate C-Suite executives. In the second quarter of 2017, we acquired L’Argus de la Presse (“Argus”), a Paris-based provider of media monitoring services to expand our media monitoring solutions and enhance our access to French media content. We acquired CEDROM-SNi Inc. (“CEDROM”) in December 2017 and PRIME Research Group (“Prime”) in January 2018 in order to further expand upon our media measurement and analysis services and improve our digital media monitoring solutions. In January of 2019, we completed our acquisitions of Falcon.io (“Falcon”) and TrendKite (“TrendKite”). We believe that Falcon will further enhance our social media management and analysis capabilities that we anticipate will be integral to the future of earned media management. We believe that TrendKite will further solidify our position as a leading global provider of public relations software, media distribution, media intelligence and related professional services. Also in January of 2019, we divested our email marketing assets. The sale of the assets resulted from a detailed review of our long-term business strategy and desire to focus on C3.
 
We provide our comprehensive solution principally through subscription contracts which are generally one year or longer, with different tiers of pricing depending on the level of functionality and customer support required. Our SaaS delivery model provides a stable recurring revenue base. In 2018, we generated $730.4 million of revenue, of which, approximately 85% was generated by customers purchasing services on a subscription or recurring basis. We consider services recurring if customers routinely purchase these services from us pursuant to a negotiated “rate card” or similar arrangements, even if we do not have subscription agreements with them. As of December 31, 2018, we had more than 75,000 customers, of which the top 25 only accounted for 6.8% of 2018 revenues, on a pro forma basis assuming a full year of Prime acquisition revenues.
 
Industry
 
PR professionals are responsible for critical corporate functions including communications and relations with media, government, consumers, industry and community stakeholders. The process of managing relationships and communications with journalists, analysts, public officials and other key influencers and audiences is vital to an organization achieving its corporate objectives and financial success. PR is top-of-mind for senior management executives and a key component of how companies manage and enhance their brands’ reputation through the media. The primary activities of in-house PR departments and PR agencies include:

-


• | creating and communicating news, feature articles and multimedia; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | distributing information to target audiences; 
• | planning, developing, managing and monitoring traditional and social media campaigns and implementing strategies to generate interest and popularity and influence brand reputation and sentiment; 
• | organizing events such as media visits, receptions and conferences; 


• | editing and producing journals, corporate identity programs, video and other presentations; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | compiling reports on activities and campaign performance. 

 
Central to all PR activities is a distribution strategy, which determines how an organization delivers consistent and well-executed communications to key constituents. The PR function is rapidly evolving with the proliferation of digital media, as PR professionals work to optimize communications across multiple online, mobile and social channels as well as traditional media outlets. In a multi-channel, data-driven environment, content can be distributed to a significantly larger and more targeted audience, increasing the importance of a broad and reliable distribution network and creating demand for integrated solutions that include distribution, targeting, monitoring and reporting. The importance of distribution to broader PR success was a driving force behind our decision to acquire PR Newswire, the world’s largest press release distribution network, according to Burton-Taylor International Consulting LLC, as measured by total revenue.
 
PR Professionals Face an Increasingly Complex Landscape
 
The emergence and proliferation of digital media, search engine technology and social media has driven rapid change in the public relations and communications industries. In addition to traditional interaction with journalists and editors to manage news and content distributed through print media channels, PR and communications professionals must now also interact with and monitor bloggers, online news sites, consumer review websites, social media platforms and customer communications. The increasing complexity of these functions requires the use of numerous, sophisticated and often discrete software tools, analytics, and professional services to achieve PR professionals’ business objectives.
Digital Media Landscape is Evolving
 
Media consumption patterns and brand interactions with consumers are rapidly evolving. Consumer purchases are increasingly influenced by a variety of different information sources, including search engines, blogs, online reviews and social media networks. This dynamic presents a challenge for marketing professionals who have traditionally relied on paid and owned media to shape a brand’s image and perception with consumers. As a result, marketers are being forced to reevaluate how they reach and engage with their target audience.
 
As opposed to paid media campaigns, which directly target consumers through television, radio, print and search engine advertising, or owned media campaigns, which directly target consumers through company websites or social media accounts, earned media campaigns do not directly target consumers but rather they target key influencers. With consumer behavior increasingly shaped by these influencers, including online reviewers, press and social media posters, effective earned media campaigns are becoming critical for marketers.
 
Rising Importance of Earned Media Channels in Driving Purchase Decisions
 
According to Nielsen, earned media is recognized as the most trusted media category, yet we believe it receives a smaller allocation of marketing budgets at most companies than owned and paid media. Marketers have traditionally targeted the paid and owned channels because content is more easily controlled through those channels; however, declining efficacy of paid media and higher consumer trust in earned media is increasing marketers’ focus on the earned media channel, which is one of our core competencies.
 
In addition to having a greater impact on consumer purchase decisions than paid media, earned media has a lower cost, as distribution is assisted by the content author. As such, earned media’s return on investment is higher. Chief marketing officers are beginning to recognize this dynamic and the value of earned media, which is driving a shift of paid media dollars into the earned channel, according to Outsell Inc.
 
Proactive management of earned media has increased in importance following the recent rise of consumers’ suspicions of “fake news.” Brands have responded to this challenge by proactively publishing factual content around key issues to manage their brand and reputation where possible. Press releases are considered an appropriate outlet for this purpose and have long been viewed by journalists and other earned media sources as a preferred source of reliable information.

We believe Cision's market leadership in driving the future of earned media management is bolstered by the acquisitions of Falcon and TrendKite, which will help us move beyond the tactical nature of PR point solutions. While Falcon will continue to be offered as a stand-alone social media platform for marketers, advertisers, and customer experience professionals, it will also be integrated with C3 to expand social media capabilities to earned media and communications professionals. We believe integrating Falcon into the C3 platform will enable marketing and communications professionals to fully integrate their campaigns across owned, earned and paid media. We believe TrendKite will enhance our customers’ abilities to demonstrate and measure the business impact of their earned media communications.
 
Preference for Platforms over Point Solutions
 
A comprehensive and integrated PR platform is becoming increasingly critical as the proliferation of new media channels drives complexity in the execution of successful PR and marketing campaigns. PR, communications and marketing professionals increasingly value and prefer the ease of having the entire solution set - monitoring, analyzing, identifying and distributing - on a single, integrated platform.
Large Addressable Market
 
Spending on financial market data/analysis and news set new highs in 2017, while showing the greatest year-on-year growth since 2011, according to a report published today by Burton-Taylor International Consulting. The report finds that global spend was up 3.57%, to reach $28.48 billion, topping the $28 billion mark for the first time. This market comprises spend on press release distribution, media and social media monitoring, measurement and engagement, and targeting. Key drivers of steady growth in recent years include GDP and advertising expenditure growth, proliferation of advanced social media tools and an increasing focus on transparency and information disclosure.
 
As the needs of PR and marketing professionals converge, with the mutual desire for measurement and attribution, we believe the PR and communications software market is beginning to converge with the broader digital marketing market, which is expected to reach $195 billion by 2020 according to Statista.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
Our competitive strengths include:
 
Comprehensive and Fully Integrated Cloud-Based Platform
 
C3 offers the communications professional a “one-stop shop” for virtually all the tools they need to conceive, execute, monitor and analyze an earned media campaign. We believe that offering a comprehensive cloud-based platform with multiple integrated functionalities is what communications professionals require and prefer over the alternative of using several individual point solutions that are not interconnected, lack consistency and require interactions with, and payments to, several external software providers. The effectiveness and appeal of integrated platforms over point solutions has been demonstrated in the broader marketing realm with the creation and growth of cloud-based platforms such as the Adobe Marketing Cloud, the Oracle Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce Marketing Cloud.
An Industry Standard for PR Professionals
 
We believe our PR software is known as a go-to global SaaS platform for communications professionals and is deeply embedded in industry workflow. For individuals working in the PR sector, fluency with our platform is viewed by many as a key skill.
Global Product Reach
 
Our offering has wide geographic reach within all our vertical markets. We believe that being able to deal with only one provider to deliver earned media solutions across the globe is a key differentiator that has value to clients, in particular large multi-national corporations that manage PR and communications efforts globally.
Proprietary Content and Solutions
 
Our platform incorporates the largest media database and largest distribution network in the world, as measured by revenue estimates from Burton-Taylor International Consulting LLC. With our proprietary database of approximately 1.6 million contacts for journalists, bloggers and social influencers, including contact information, in-depth profiles, preferences and detailed pitching tips, clients can build smarter media lists to connect with the appropriate influencers and build meaningful relationships. Through our distribution network, customers can conduct both wide-reaching and targeted campaigns across traditional and digital media in more than 170 countries in over 40 languages.

Ease of Use and Workflow Capabilities
 
Our platform is designed with easy-to-use functionality, built-in workflow capabilities, a high degree of flexibility in outputs and a sleek and intuitive user interface to help the communications professional execute their work in the best way possible.
Experienced Management Team with a Proven Track Record
 
We have a strong, highly experienced management team. CEO Kevin Akeroyd has more than 25 years of experience reshaping modern digital, social and mobile marketing. In his previous role, he was an integral member of the team that built the marketing cloud business unit at Oracle from a nascent stage into one of the largest marketing and advertising technology providers in the industry. Our CFO, Jack Pearlstein, has 20 years of financial, operational and strategic planning experience with technology companies.
Growth Strategy
 
We intend to continue to drive growth and enhance its market position through the following key strategies:
 
Acquire New Customers
 
We believe there is still a substantial opportunity to increase market penetration globally by selling our C3 platform advantage. Most vendors in the market offer point solutions that address one or two functions in a PR campaign, resulting in the need for multiple vendors. We believe chief marketing officers prefer integrated platforms over individual solutions. C3 provides the market with a comprehensive platform that integrates all the core capabilities needed for a PR software campaign, establishing us as a reference platform for the PR software market.
Continue to Develop Innovative Products and Features
 
We understand the importance of offering an easy-to-use product with extensive features that meet and exceed our customers’ needs. Our product team is constantly working to introduce new features that augment our existing platform. We continue to drive customers down an overall solutions path, so they can use C3 as their communications technology platform, Cision Impact as their analytics and business results attribution, and Cision Audiences to not only improve performance of their much larger paid and owned budgets, but also to execute integrated campaigns across Paid, Owned, and Earned media with Cision ID as the backbone. Cision Impact is our offering that allows clients to show the validated reach, engagement, audience data, and actual sales conversion data from customers exposed to earned media. Cision Audiences is our offering that allows clients to match Cision ID-based data through identity resolution and integrate across their Paid, Owned and Earned media campaigns. Our account management and customer service representatives continuously communicate the needs of our customers to the product team, providing for continuous platform improvement.
 
Our new product innovation pipeline aims to introduce new products to market that improve the way PR and marketing professionals do business. We plan to leverage C3, which provides a fully integrated set of PR capabilities under one umbrella by adding data attribution capabilities. We believe that our measurement and attribution capabilities, which we added to our platform in the first quarter of 2018, will enable customers to track end-user reach, demographics, engagement and purchase conversion data from their earned media campaigns, allowing customers to measure return on investment. Subject to the strictest adherence to privacy concerns, we plan to sell the highly valuable and anonymized consumer and influencer data we compile to brands and media networks that may use the data to improve audience targeting and increase advertising effectiveness.
 
Increase Revenue from Existing Customers
 
We believe a significant opportunity exists to increase spending by our more than 75,000 existing customers by expanding C3 capabilities and our service offerings. Because we have grown through many acquisitions and because a comprehensive platform did not previously exist in the PR software market, many of our customers still use various PR point solutions, including solutions provided by competitors. For example, as of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 16,000 U.S. customers that we inherited with the acquisition of PR Newswire and had approximately 13,000 other U.S. customers. We estimate that approximately 3,700 of these customers overlap. By providing the first comprehensive platform for executing and analyzing earned media campaigns, we are well positioned to increase product penetration among existing customers by encouraging them to bundle various point solutions under one umbrella. In some markets, we have not yet introduced our full range of products, including C3, but we believe we have the capability to roll out our entire product suite in each of these markets. We believe this roll out will increase average customer spend through increased product penetration and attract new customers through a broader product set. Additionally, our sales team has historically been successful in selling higher tiered product or service offerings to existing clients and will have more opportunities to increase product penetration as our product team continues to add products and features to C3.
Expand into New Geographies and Market Segments
 
We have an expansive global reach, spanning many major international markets around the globe, including but not limited to, North America, China, EMEA, India, and Latin America. In many international markets, our presence is currently limited. We view these markets as opportunities for geographic expansion, especially Latin America, Asia and Continental Europe.

We aim to establish the earned media cloud as the third marketing software category, alongside paid and owned media, by providing valuable demographic, psychographic, sociographic and attribution end-user data to our customers and by selling the data to brands and media networks. We believe that our development of data attribution and data monetization products will enable us to enter the marketing software market. If we are able to establish ourselves in that market, we could then enter the broader digital marketing market through platform extensions into adjacent earned media categories. These categories include ratings and reviews, employee amplification, influencer performance and content marketing. We plan to opportunistically employ both organic initiatives and acquisitions to expand into the digital marketing market.
 
Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions
 
We have successfully sourced and are completing the integration of several strategic acquisitions since our inception. These acquisitions have strengthened our market position and enabled us to provide a comprehensive PR communications product suite with a scaled, efficient cost-structure. Our management actively evaluates additional acquisition opportunities to enhance our position in the global PR software market by expanding its market reach, geographic presence and product capabilities.
Products and Services
 
C3 delivers critical functionality across the entire earned media lifecycle. We believe that C3 is the first software solution that allows communications professionals to plan, execute and analyze PR campaigns in a fully integrated fashion. Given the relatively recent launch of C3, the majority of our revenue today comes from customers who purchase only a subset of the capabilities we currently offer. As C3 continues to expand its capabilities and these customers are migrated onto the C3 platform, we will attempt to upsell additional capabilities. For example, a customer who previously used our prior monitoring technology to plan campaigns and monitor campaign results will now be a candidate to purchase press release distribution services. Similarly, customers who purchase the press release distribution service within C3 will have improved ability to measure the return on investment of specific campaign activities compared to customers who use other press release distribution services that cannot access the monitoring and analytical capabilities of C3.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 85% of our revenue was subscription-based or recurring, with only 15% being transactional. Non subscription-based revenue is largely related to our press release distribution services which are increasingly being sold on a subscription basis as part of C3.
 
Media Database
 
Discovering and maintaining relationships with relevant journalists and other influencers that communicate an organization’s message to the public are critical to any earned media strategy. We offer the largest database in the world, based on database revenue estimates from Burton-Taylor International Consulting LLC, with contacts for approximately 1.6 million journalists and other influencers across 200 countries, including approximately 200,000 digital influencers. The database is updated more than 12,000 times daily to provide the most accurate and timely information to PR and communications professionals.
 
Our media database is integrated with CRM tools and content generation and distribution features to give PR and communications professionals access to relevant influencers when planning a campaign as well as to schedule and record all interactions with contacts. Access to the database is offered on a global basis.
 
Media Distribution
 
The distribution strategy of an earned media campaign determines how a company delivers consistent and well-executed communications to influencers across the media spectrum. In a multi-channel, data-driven environment, press releases and other content can be distributed to a significantly larger audience, increasing the importance of a broad and reliable distribution network. Our distribution product allows earned media professionals to execute campaigns and distribute corporate news, events information, content and multimedia through press releases, web and email. Compared to free, high volume channels such as social media and corporate newsrooms, we believe our distribution platform is an important way for brands to signal the relative importance of a message. This signaling mechanism is often the difference between a message becoming part of the “noise” or ending up in the hands of a key influencer. Brands compete for influencer attention with several thousand stories that are transmitted over the major distribution networks in a day, which compares favorably to competing with 500 million tweets per day on Twitter.
 
We believe we have the largest global distribution network of its kind in the world, based on distribution revenue estimates from Burton-Taylor International Consulting LLC. Our network reaches traditional and digital media in more than 170 countries in over 40 languages, including major media organizations, over 10,000 syndicated websites and over 900,000 contacts such as journalists, bloggers and social influencers. Our products enable communications professionals to distribute press releases and other content such as photos, videos, infographics, financial information and articles through web, wire and email. In addition, we offer around-the-clock editorial support for clients.
 
Our premium distribution product is PR Newswire. For more than 60 years, the PR Newswire offering has represented an industry standard for high-impact dissemination of critical news, financial releases and other content and has customers spanning Fortune 2000 multinationals, small and medium businesses, public relations agencies and government entities. Our premium PR Newswire offering is provided to customers globally, with international operations supporting these customers in Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. Additional premium offerings include a comprehensive suite of products and services for Investor Relations professionals, including distribution for earnings and other material news, webcasts and conference calls, IR website hosting, and virtual investor conferences.

Media Monitoring
 
We enable PR and communications professionals to track the media coverage of their companies and brands, assess the impact of strategic initiatives and discover how influencers portray their content and gauge overall brand sentiment. Our products allow clients to monitor all forms of media, including global print, digital, social media, television and radio sources, and store articles, content and corporate news. Our media monitoring software tracks and monitors content on over 220,000 digital, print, social and broadcast sources in over 200 countries. We deliver over 3 million stories to our customers every day. Additionally, through the acquisition of Bulletin Intelligence, we have expanded our capability to provide expert-curated executive briefings to the Executive Office of the President and corporate C-Suite executives. We provide our existing global customer base with enhanced access to French media content, helping them understand and quantify the impact of their communications and media coverage in France. We also offer access to tools to filter and automatically update relevant news sources and content to make monitoring an efficient aspect of customers’ overall PR strategies. The graphics below are examples of monitoring insights we provide to customers from their PR campaigns. The acquisition of Prime in 2018 complements Cision’s existing technology and service offerings and provides a basis for significant synergies. Similar to previous acquisitions the plan for Prime will be to scale the technology and services across all geographies and all sectors served by Cision through integration into C3. Prime’s technology is able to provide intelligent topic detection, entity recognition and semantic profiling for communication, marketing, sales, supply chain and risk management. It is also able to integrate, analyze and evaluate media performance across all channels – social, digital, print and broadcast – to deliver actionable insights and strategic guidance for better communications and business results.
Media Analysis
 
We provide functionality that enables our customers to assess media coverage by collecting and analyzing data and metrics configured to meet the needs of the client. Metrics on audience engagement, campaign reach and effectiveness, sentiment and competitive benchmarking allow PR and communications professionals to quantify campaign results of earned media strategies. Analysis also provides data-driven insights that inform the creation of future campaigns and marketing investment.
 
Our media analysis capabilities also include a robust technology-enabled service aimed at Global 2000 companies with complex PR strategies, as well as an automated self-serve module that can be configured by customers for high-level reporting needs. The charts below are examples of analysis insights we provide to customers from their PR campaigns.
 


Customers
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had a large and highly diversified customer base of more than 75,000 customers, spanning the Americas, Europe and Asia. Customers range from small businesses to large enterprises across a wide range of industries and also include a large number of PR agencies. Annual spend for these customers can range from hundreds of dollars for small businesses to several million for the largest customers.

--

 

Our customer base includes 92 of the world’s 100 most valuable brands, according to Forbes.com and 96 of the top 100 PR companies in the United States, as listed in the Holmes Report 2018.
 
Select customers include McDonald’s, Samsung, Edelman, Coca Cola, Google, and Nike. Our top 25 customers account for only 6.8% of 2018 revenues, on a pro forma basis assuming a full year of Prime and the other 2018 acquisition revenues.
 
Technology Infrastructure
 
Technology is key to our Communications Cloud strategy of creating a unique competitive advantage by offering what we believe to be the only globally accessible end-to-end PR workflow solution in the market. Our PR software platforms are built upon a highly scalable and flexible component or multi-tenant based infrastructures in a hybrid cloud environment, allowing us to provide a cost effective and secure offering. The platforms leverage proven delivery technologies along with leading big data and analytic offerings to create a competitive advantage. Our online infrastructure is geographically distributed across multiple public and private cloud locations to facilitate both resilience and performance.
 
We have an experienced and highly skilled technology team managing product development and IT operations. We utilize a modified agile development approach with a standard 2-week cadence but can accelerate or extend deployment time-frames as needed. This agile approach to development is partnered with an IT Infrastructure Library focused “DevOps” based approach to ensure that there are appropriate controls and a heightened focus on the customer experience.
 
We maintain a focus on continual improvement from both an IT performance and security perspective. For our critical systems and platforms, we have implemented initiatives and procedures that include:
 

• | A technology risk framework that enables us to identify opportunities for improvement, emerging patterns, and other concerns so they can be understood, addressed and periodically re-reviewed. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | A multi-pronged approach to security that includes awareness education, asset and data identification, protection, detection, response and remediation. 
• | An architectural approach that puts security in the forefront for all new development initiatives to improve efficacy and reduce our longer-term security costs. 

 
We intend to extend these approaches to our other systems, platforms and acquisitions as appropriate.
 
Over the past three years, we have initiated several consolidation and integration initiatives aimed at simplifying and modernizing our critical infrastructures to increase flexibility, improve margins and further improve the customer experience. These initiatives include data center consolidations, infrastructure upgrades, management information software system enhancements and the deployment of enhanced global operating models across our operations.
 
Sales & Marketing
 
We operate direct sales organizations throughout the United States and within each of its international markets. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 750 direct sales professionals. In the United States, we divide our direct sales professionals into two distinct go-to-market teams: new business teams and account management (renewal) teams. Within each of the two go-to-market teams, U.S. direct sales professionals are further segmented into groups based upon customer size, including an enterprise group for large customers and agencies, a midmarket group for medium size customers and a small business group for small customers. Our U.S. new business sales teams source and develop new customer relationships. Our U.S. account management sales teams focus on maintaining customer relationships, increasing product penetration and ensuring contract renewals. In the United Kingdom and in several other larger international markets, our direct sales structure is similar to that in the United States. In our smaller international markets, there are sometimes unified direct sales structures without clear distinction between new business teams and account management teams.
 
Our marketing team focuses on attracting, acquiring and retaining customers through digital demand campaigns, brand building and showcases of customer success. With persona-based content aimed at communications professionals, the team delivers cross-channel campaigns that span paid search, email, web and customer events. Supporting our global sales team, marketing also develops messaging, product positioning, and tools to communicate the business value of our solutions. To establish the Communications Cloud category, marketing develops insightful thought leadership for our executives to disseminate through content marketing and keynote presentations. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 80 marketing professionals globally.

Competition
 
The communications software market is highly fragmented, highly competitive and rapidly evolving. Whereas we believe that our product suite provides a global end-to-end solution, other industry participants generally operate in select geographic regions or particular verticals including media monitoring and analysis or distribution. In media monitoring and analysis, industry participants include Meltwater, Kantar Media, and iSentia. In distribution, industry participants include Business Wire, West Corporation and The London Stock Exchange through its RNS service.
 
Key factors which impact competition in our industry include:
 

• | Product features, effectiveness and reliability; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------
• | User interface and ease of use; 
• | Media database breadth and quality; 
• | Expertise of sales and after-market support organizations;
• | Measurement and attribution capabilities; 
• | Breadth and depth of the distribution network; 
• | Pace of innovation and product roadmap; 
• | Strength of professional services organization; 
• | Price of products and services; and 
• | Scale and financial stability of the organization. 

Employees and Culture
 
Building and maintaining a strong corporate culture benefits both our customers and our employees and serves as the foundation for the successful execution of our strategy. As a result, our corporate culture is critical for its growth strategy.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,500 global employees, with approximately 1,500 employees located in the United States and approximately 3,000 employees located internationally. We also engage temporary employees and consultants. None of our employees in the United States are members of a union; however, approximately 600 of our foreign employees are currently subject to collective bargaining agreements and/or are members of local work councils. We consider relations with our employees to be very good.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks and domain names. Additionally, we have filed U.S. patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology and own several issued patents. We also control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information and enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with substantially all of our employees, consultants and other third parties, pursuant to which such employees, consultants and other parties assign to us the intellectual property rights that they develop and agree to keep confidential our confidential and proprietary information.
 
We currently license content included in our cloud-based software from several providers pursuant to data reseller, data distribution and license agreements with these providers. These agreements provide us with content such as news coverage from print and Internet news sites, as well as contact information for journalists, analysts, public officials, media outlets and publicity opportunities. The licenses for this content are non-exclusive. The agreements vary in length, and generally renew automatically subject to certain cancellation provisions available to the parties. We do not believe that any of our content providers are single source suppliers, the loss of whom would substantially affect our business.
 
Our business involves the supply of copyrighted works of third-parties, including publishers and broadcasters, which necessitates working closely with these copyright owners on clients’ behalf. Delivering content to clients typically requires copyright fees to be paid to copyright owners. We are typically able to pass these copyright fees directly through to clients.
 
We also contract with content providers for the rights to access and distribute paywalled or subscription-only content. As paywalled content becomes increasingly prevalent on publisher websites, we expect to continue negotiating access rights with key content providers.
 
If a claim is asserted that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of a third-party, we may be required to seek licenses to that technology. In addition, we license third-party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our services. Licenses from third parties may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost, or at all. Additionally, the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights or proprietary technology. Competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technologies we employ in our services.

Cyclicality
 
Demand for our products and services fluctuates from month to month, with periods of greater demand corresponding to earnings release cycles of public companies and periods of lower demand corresponding to periods in which activity in the financial markets is reduced, such as during months with fewer business days and months with more holidays, due to the transactional component of our distribution business.
