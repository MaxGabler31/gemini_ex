 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 DFIN is a leading global risk and compliance solutions company. The Company provides regulatory filing and deal solutions via its software, technology-enabled services and print and distribution solutions to public and private companies, mutual funds and other regulated investment firms, to serve its clients’ regulatory and compliance needs. DFIN helps its clients comply with applicable regulations where and how they want to work in a digital world, providing numerous solutions tailored to each client’s precise needs. The prevailing trend is toward clients choosing to utilize the Company’s software solutions, in conjunction with its tech-enabled services, to meet their document and filing needs, while at the same time shifting away from physical print and distribution of documents, except for cases where it is still regulatorily required or requested by stockholders.
 The Company serves its clients’ regulatory and compliance needs throughout their respective life cycles. For its capital markets clients, the Company offers solutions that allow public companies to comply with applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulations including filing agent services, digital document creation and online content management tools that support their corporate financial transactions and regulatory reporting; solutions to facilitate clients’ communications with their stockholders; and virtual data rooms and other deal management solutions. For investment companies, including mutual fund, insurance-investment and alternative investment companies, the Company provides solutions for creating, compiling and filing regulatory communications as well as solutions for investors designed to improve the access to and accuracy of their investment information.
Technological advancements, regulatory changes, and evolving workflow preferences have led to the Company’s clients managing more of the financial disclosure process themselves, changing the marketplace for the Company’s services and products. DFIN’s strategy in its Software Solutions segments (CM-SS and IC-SS, as defined below) aligns with the changing marketplace by focusing the Company’s investments and resources in its advanced software solutions, primarily ActiveDisclosure®, Arc Suite and Venue® Virtual Data Room (“Venue”), while making targeted investments, such as the Company’s acquisition of Guardum Holdings Limited ("Guardum"), to further enhance its solution set. In its Compliance & Communications Management segments (CM-CCM and IC-CCM, as defined below), the Company’s strategy focuses on maintaining its market-leading position by offering a high-touch, service-oriented experience, using its unique combination of tech-enabled services and print and distribution capabilities.
Capital Markets
 The Company provides software solutions, technology-enabled services and print and distribution solutions to public and private companies that are, or are preparing to become, subject to the filing and reporting requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Clients leverage the Company’s software solutions, proprietary technology, deep industry expertise and experience to successfully navigate the SEC’s specified file formats when submitting compliance documents through the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (“EDGAR”) system for their transactional and ongoing compliance needs. The Company assists its capital markets clients throughout the course of public and private business transactions; mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”), initial public offerings (“IPOs”), initial creation of special purpose acquisition corporations (“SPAC”) and subsequent de-SPAC (acquisition of a public or private company), debt offerings and other similar transactions. In addition, the Company provides clients with compliance solutions to prepare their ongoing required Exchange Act filings that are compatible with the SEC’s EDGAR system, most notably Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Form 8-K and proxy filings. These solutions include the Company’s traditional full-service EDGAR filing preparation and filing agent services, technology-enabled services and print and distribution solutions as well as the Company’s software solutions, ActiveDisclosure, Venue, eBrevia and others. In 2021, approximately 55% of capital markets net sales were transactional in nature, approximately 24% of capital market net sales were related to software solutions, including Venue and ActiveDisclosure, and approximately 21% of capital markets net sales were compliance in nature.
   Transaction Solutions
 The Company helps capital markets clients throughout the course of public and private business transactions. For M&A transactions, the Company supports deal participants in creating transaction-related registration statements, proxy statements and prospectuses, filing client documents as their filing agent through the EDGAR filing system and managing print for distribution to stockholders. The Company also provides registration statement and prospectus preparation and filing services through the Company’s filing solution and software solution, ActiveDisclosure, data room and secure file sharing through Venue as well as contract analytics through eBrevia.
 The Company’s Venue solution is a highly secure data room platform that allows clients to share confidential information in real-time throughout the transaction lifecycle. Clients can also maintain control over sensitive data when conducting due diligence for M&A transactions, raising capital for an IPO or developing a document repository. Specifically, companies have used Venue to securely organize, manage, distribute and track corporate governance, financing, legal and other documents in an online workspace accessible to internal and outside advisors. Via integration with the Company’s eBrevia solution, Venue uses artificial intelligence to analyze documents to help clients better understand their content and make informed decisions. Venue's auto-redaction capability, powered by Guardum, also allows clients to protect personally identifiable information ("PII") using efficient, secure, systematically burned-in redaction.
 The Company’s eBrevia solution leverages artificial intelligence-based data extraction and contract analytics algorithms to provide enterprise contract review and analysis solutions, utilizing machine learning to produce fast and accurate results. eBrevia's software, which extracts and summarizes key provisions and other information, is leveraged in due diligence, contract management, lease abstraction and document drafting. eBrevia complements the Company’s Venue offerings to provide clients with secure data aggregation, due diligence, compliance and risk management solutions.
The Company also offers clients the use of private conferencing facilities in major global cities. This service helps clients maintain confidentiality in deal negotiations and provides clients a place to host in-person working groups to meet, strategize and prepare documents for the transactional deal stream. The Company’s sites are outfitted to provide around-the-clock services to support the transaction process. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company transformed its production platform and service delivery model for a fully-virtual experience while replicating the in-person experience. The Company anticipates that in the future, clients will utilize the range of options available to them, including a hybrid approach with working group members working both virtually and in-person during drafting sessions for their transactions.
 Compliance Solutions
 The Company provides compliance solutions to capital markets clients in preparing the Exchange Act filings that are compatible with the SEC’s EDGAR system. Capital markets clients leverage the Company’s deep industry expertise and experience to successfully navigate the SEC’s specified file formats when submitting compliance documents through the EDGAR system.
In 2021, the Company launched an entirely new cloud-based product, ActiveDisclosure ("ActiveDisclosure"), which provides new features such as built-in collaboration tools and eXtensible Business Reporting Language (“XBRL”) client-tagging capability. The new product replaces ActiveDisclosure 3.0, which will be decommissioned once the transition of clients has been completed. ActiveDisclosure provides capital markets clients with end-to-end solutions to collaborate, tag, validate and file with the SEC efficiently. By leveraging its software platform, ActiveDisclosure brings teams together across departments, functions and geographies in real time to create and edit filings and other documents across devices, simultaneously, while providing detailed audit trails for tracking every change made and employing interactive notifications for important tasks or comments. ActiveDisclosure utilizes native Excel reporting capabilities of financial consolidation systems to seamlessly flow changes throughout an entire document automatically, reducing risk and providing additional assurance to clients. The Company employs stringent data security and privacy practices to provide that information is encrypted. The Company also engages third parties to perform annual SOC2 Type II compliance audits and penetration/vulnerability testing.
 The Company also supports capital markets clients in meeting SEC-mandated regulatory filing requirements, including tagged filing in the XBRL format. The Company provides clients with a suite of tagging, review and validation tools to assist them with the XBRL requirements. The Company has accounting and finance professionals that assist its capital markets clients with the processes of tag selection, tag review, file creation, validation and distribution.

   The Company helps capital markets clients elevate their proxy filings from compliance documents to investor-focused strategic communications tools with Proxy Design services. The Company’s end-to-end proxy solutions include advisory services, proxy strategy and design, disclosure management, EDGAR filing and expertise, online hosting solutions, print production, distribution and annual meeting services.
The Company provides additional compliance solutions through strategic partnerships, including a full suite of audit management and compliance solutions for Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”) compliance, operational audits, IT compliance, enterprise risk management and workflow management.
 The Company’s EDGAR® Online and EDGARPro solutions deliver intelligent solutions in financial disclosures, allow for the creation and distribution of company data and public filings as well as provide subscription-based tools for financial data analysis.
Through a minority investment in and commercial agreement with Mediant Communications, Inc. (“Mediant”), the Company can simplify the annual meeting and proxy process for its capital markets clients via project management services and state-of-the-art voting and tabulation technology. This partnership allows the Company to manage and centralize communications for all investors, fulfill and distribute proxy materials and host virtual stockholder meetings.
Investment Companies
 The Company provides software solutions, technology-enabled services and print, distribution and fulfillment solutions to its investment companies clients, primarily consisting of mutual fund companies, alternative investment companies, insurance-investment companies and third-party administrators, that are subject to the filing and reporting requirements of the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”) as well as European and Canadian regulations. The Company’s Arc Suite software platform, which includes ArcDigital, ArcReporting, ArcPro and ArcRegulatory, enables its investment companies clients to comply with applicable ongoing SEC, Canadian and European regulations as well as to create, manage and deliver accurate and timely financial communications to investors and regulators. Investment companies leverage the Company’s proprietary technology, deep industry expertise and experience to successfully navigate the SEC’s specified file formats when submitting compliance documents (including incorporating appropriate XBRL tagging) through the EDGAR system.
In 2021, approximately 60% of investment companies net sales were compliance in nature, approximately 35% of the investment companies net sales were related to software solutions, and approximately 5% of investment companies net sales were transactional in nature. The Company’s services and sales teams currently support clients in the United States, Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, France, Luxembourg, Poland, India and Australia.
The Company’s Arc Suite software platform provides investment companies clients with a comprehensive suite of cloud-based technology services and products that store and manage information in a self-service, central repository allowing regulatory documents to be easily accessed, assembled, edited, translated, rendered and submitted to regulators for compliance purposes. Arc Suite products are cloud-based and include automation and single-source data validation which streamlines processes and drives efficiency for clients. The Company's Total Compliance Management ("TCM") offering allows clients to utilize multiple Arc Suite products to streamline the creation and distribution of materials required by the SEC Rules 30e-3 and 498A.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company transformed its production platform and service delivery model for a fully-virtual experience while replicating the in-person experience.

Company History
 On October 1, 2016, DFIN became an independent publicly traded company through the distribution by R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (“RRD”) of shares of DFIN common stock to RRD stockholders (the “Separation”). On October 1, 2016, RRD also completed the separation of LSC Communications, Inc. (“LSC”), its publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business.
In 2018, the Company sold its Language Solutions business. Prior to its sale, the Language Solutions business supported domestic and international businesses in different countries and in a variety of industries, including the financial, corporate, life sciences and legal industries, among others, by helping them adapt their business content into different languages for specific countries, markets and regions through a complete suite of language services and products.
   In 2018, the Company acquired eBrevia Inc. ("eBrevia"), a provider of artificial intelligence-based data extraction and contract analytics software solutions. Prior to the acquisition, the Company held a 12.8% investment in eBrevia. The purchase price for the remaining equity of eBrevia, which included the Company’s estimate of contingent consideration, was $23.3 million, net of cash acquired of $0.2 million, as well as payments of $4.5 million and $1.9 million in 2019 and 2020, respectively. eBrevia's software, which extracts and summarizes key legal provisions and other information, is used in due diligence, contract management, lease abstraction and document drafting and enhances the Company’s Venue offerings to provide clients with secure data aggregation, due diligence, compliance and risk management solutions. eBrevia’s operations are included within the CM-SS operating segment.
 On December 13, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Guardum, a leading data security and privacy software provider that helps companies locate, secure and control data. The acquisition enhances the Company's Venue offering. By safeguarding privacy and improving data accuracy, Guardum's data security is a competitive differentiator. Prior to the acquisition, the Company held a 33.0% investment in Guardum. The purchase price for the remaining equity of Guardum was $3.6 million, net of cash acquired of $0.1 million.
Markets and Competition
Technological and regulatory changes continue to impact the market for the Company’s services and products. In addition to the Company’s ongoing innovation in its software solutions, the Company’s competitive strengths include its ability to offer a wide array of products for required regulatory communications, compliance services, a global platform, exceptional sales and service and regulatory domain expertise, which provide differentiated solutions for its clients.
The global risk and compliance industry, in general, is highly competitive and barriers to entry have decreased as a result of technology innovation and the simplification of EDGAR filings. Despite some consolidation in recent years, the industry remains highly fragmented in the United States and even more so internationally with many in-country alternative providers. The Company expects competition to increase from existing competitors as well as new and emerging market entrants. In addition, as the Company expands its services and product offerings, it may face competition from new and existing competitors. The Company competes primarily on the depth and breadth of its products, features, benefits, service levels, subject matter regulatory expertise, security, price and reputation.
The impact of digital technologies has impacted many of the products and markets in which the Company competes, most acutely in the Company’s mutual fund, variable annuity and public company compliance business offerings. While the Company offers a high-touch, service oriented experience, technology changes have provided alternatives to the Company’s clients that allow them to manage more of the financial disclosure process themselves. The Company has invested in its own software solutions, ActiveDisclosure, Arc Suite and Venue, to serve clients and increase retention, and has invested to expand capabilities and address new market sectors. The future impact of technology as well as the streamlining and modernizing of disclosure requirements on the business is difficult to predict and could result in additional expenditures to restructure impacted operations or develop new technologies. In addition, the Company has made targeted acquisitions and investments in its existing business to offer clients innovative services and solutions, including the acquisition of eBrevia and Guardum and investments in Mediant and Gain Compliance that support the Company’s position as a technology service leader in this evolving industry.
The Company’s competitors for SEC filing services for public company compliance clients include full service financial communications providers, technology point solution providers focused on financial communications and general technology providers. The Company’s competitors for Venue include providers of virtual data room-specific solutions and enterprise software providers that offer online products that serve as document repositories, virtual data rooms as well as file sharing and collaboration solutions. The Company’s competitors for SEC filing services for investment companies clients include full service traditional providers, small niche technology providers as well as local and regional print providers that bid against the Company for printing, mailing and fulfillment services.  
Technology
 The Company invests resources in developing software solutions to address customer and market requirements. The Company invests in client facing solutions and its core composition systems and has also adopted market-leading third-party systems which have improved the efficiency of its sales and operations processes. The Company has continued to invest in enhancements of its technology-based offerings including ActiveDisclosure, the Arc Suite software platform, Venue, EDGAR filing and iXBRL services and data and analytics solutions. The Company continues to invest in leading and innovative technology such as cloud-native solutions, composable applications, API management machine learning and hybrid cloud architecture.

   Market Volatility/Cyclicality and Seasonality
 The Company’s Capital Markets segments (CM-SS and CM-CCM), in particular, are subject to market volatility in the United States and world economy, as the success of the transactional and Venue offerings is largely dependent on the global market for IPOs, secondary offerings, M&A, public and private debt offerings, leveraged buyouts, spinouts, special purpose acquisition company ("SPAC") and de-SPAC transactions and other transactions. A variety of factors impact the global markets for transactions, including economic activity levels, market volatility, the regulatory and political environment, geopolitical and civil unrest and global pandemics, among others. Due to the significant net sales and profitability derived from transactional and Venue offerings, market volatility can lead to uneven financial performance when comparing to previous periods. U.S. IPOs, M&A transactions and public debt offerings were also disrupted by the U.S. federal government shutdown that occurred, most recently, from December 2018 to January 2019. Future government shutdowns could result in additional volatility. The Company mitigates a portion of this volatility through its compliance offerings, supporting the quarterly and annual public company reporting processes through its filing services and ActiveDisclosure, as well as its Investment Companies segments (IC-SS and IC-CCM) regulatory and stockholder communications offerings, including Arc Suite. The Company also mitigates some of that risk by offering services in higher demand during a down market, such as document management tools for the bankruptcy/restructuring process and by moving upstream in the filing process with products like Venue.
 The quarterly/annual public company reporting process work subjects the Company to filing seasonality which peaks shortly after the end of each fiscal quarter. Additionally, investment companies clients require the Company to manage the financial and regulatory reporting and filing for mutual funds on an annual basis as well as annual prospectus filings, which peaks during the second fiscal quarter. The seasonality and associated operational implications include the need to increase staff during peak periods through a combined strategy of hiring temporary personnel, increasing the premium time of existing staff and outsourcing production for a number of services. Additionally, clients and their financial advisors have begun to increasingly rely on web-based services which allow clients to autonomously file and distribute compliance documents with regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. While the Company believes that its ActiveDisclosure and Arc Suite solutions are competitive in this space, competitors are also continuing to develop technologies that aim to improve clients’ ability to autonomously produce and file documents to meet their regulatory obligations. The Company remains focused on driving annual recurring revenue to mitigate market volatility.
COVID-19
 In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, known as COVID-19, was identified in China and has since extensively impacted the global health and economic environment. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. Although COVID-19 has adversely impacted the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and overall financial performance, the extent of that impact is currently uncertain and depends on factors including the impact on the Company’s customers, employees and vendors.
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken numerous steps, and will continue to take further actions to ensure the safety of the Company's employees. At the beginning of the pandemic, the Company reviewed and implemented an updated business continuity plan, required all non-essential employees to work from home, prohibited non-essential travel and conducted client and employee meetings virtually. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company implemented a flexible model that allows employees the option to continue to work from home, with the exception of essential employees whose roles require them to be on site. In the Company's manufacturing locations, the Company is following all federal, state and local safety requirements including social distancing where possible, wearing masks and increased cleaning. The Company continues to reevaluate these measures on an ongoing basis to ensure continuity of the Company's business operations and the safety of the Company's workforce. The Company also continues to work closely with its clients to support them as they implement their own contingency plans, helping them access the Company’s services and products and continue to meet their regulatory requirements.
The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects on the Company’s business, results of operations, liquidity and overall financial performance cannot be predicted at this time.
 Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations—COVID-19 for additional information.
   Government Regulation and Regulatory Impact
 The SEC is adopting new as well as amending existing rules and forms to modernize the reporting and disclosure of information by registered investment companies. These changes are driving significant regulatory changes which impact the Company’s customers within its Investment Companies business.
On June 5, 2018, the SEC adopted Rule 30e-3 which provides certain registered investment companies with an option to electronically deliver stockholder reports and other materials rather than providing such reports in paper. Investors who prefer to receive reports in paper will continue to receive them in that format. While Rule 30e-3 was effective January 1, 2019, default electronic distribution pursuant to the rule began on January 1, 2021 due to a 24-month transition period, during which registered investment companies notified investors of the upcoming change in transmission format of stockholder reports. As a result of Rule 30e-3, the Company experienced a significant decline in the volume of printed annual and semi-annual stockholder reports in 2021 and an increase in revenue from ArcDigital software solutions. This trend is expected to continue during 2022.
 On March 11, 2020, the SEC announced that it has adopted a new rule 498A under the Securities Act and related regulatory amendments permitting variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts to use a more concise summary prospectus to provide disclosures to investors. More detailed information about the variable annuity or variable life insurance contract will be available online, and an investor must opt in to have that information delivered in paper. The new rule and related form amendments became effective on July 1, 2020 with compliance required by January 1, 2022. As a result of Rule 498A, the Company experienced a significant decline in printed prospectus volume in 2021 and an increase in revenue from the ArcPro and ArcDigital software solutions. This trend is expected to continue during 2022.
It is the Company’s policy to conduct its global operations in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that the Company may undertake in the future. However, in the opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Resources
The primary raw materials used in the Company’s printed products are paper and ink. Paper and ink are sourced from a small set of select suppliers to ensure consistent quality and provide for continuity of supply. The global supply chain challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic made it more difficult to source paper in the second half of 2021, and the Company anticipates it will continue to be more difficult and more expensive to source paper in 2022. The increased cost of paper is typically recovered by increased pricing. The Company believes that the risk of incurring material losses as a result of a shortage in raw materials is unlikely as the Company has strategically reduced its print and distribution revenue and downsized the Company's print production platform and that the losses, if any, would not have a materially negative impact on the Company’s business.
Distribution
 The Company’s products are distributed to end-users through the U.S or foreign postal services, through retail channels, electronically or by direct shipment to customer facilities.
Customers
For each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s net sales.
   Cybersecurity and Data Protection
 A core aspect of the Company’s business relies on technology and software; as a result, the security of those technologies and software, as well as the protection of the confidential information entrusted to the Company by its customers, are key components of the Company’s business and strategy. The DFIN Cybersecurity Program is based upon industry leading frameworks, which include International Standardization Organization #27001 (ISO 27001), Control Objectives for Information Technology (COBIT), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (commonly known as NIST). The Company’s technologies and software must also comply with domestic and international regulatory and legal requirements. Ensuring that these technologies and software comply with those regulations is a key focus of the Company’s efforts.
 The Company leverages cybersecurity technologies designed to provide for the security of client, employee and business confidential data. The Company’s cybersecurity portfolio is inclusive of, but not limited to, data encryption, data masking, leading secure software development methodologies, application and network penetration testing, incident response, digital forensics, least-privileged access controls, anti-malware, end-point detection and response, virtual private networks and cyber threat intelligence. Additionally, the Company manages a 24x7 Security Operations capability that monitors and responds to cyber threats in real time.
 To demonstrate transparency, the Company’s commitment to effective cybersecurity and data protection efforts and in pursuit of continuous improvement, the Company undergoes a series of third-party security reviews, including third-party penetration tests.
 Human Capital
 The Company’s human capital objective is to attract, retain and develop the talent needed to deliver on the Company’s strategic priorities. DFIN strives to get the best talent available, help them grow their career and keep them engaged and motivated with rewards based on their contributions and performance.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 2,185 employees, approximately 80% of whom are located in the United States and approximately 20% in international locations. DFIN’s workforce is approximately 40% female and 60% male, with an average tenure of approximately 13.2 years with DFIN (including periods prior to the separation from RRD). The Company also hires temporary employees in its manufacturing facilities during peak periods of production. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The Company's U.S. employee voluntary turnover rate is under 8.5% per year.
The Company recently launched its "My Total Wellbeing" strategy that provides greater market-driven and predictable pay and benefit programs. My Total Wellbeing encompasses:
My Time—DFIN evaluates its "time off" policies to address the diverse and changing needs of the workforce. DFIN offers every employee at least four weeks of paid time off, including paid sick time. Additionally, in 2021, the Company increased its paid parental leave from four to six weeks for both moms and dads. In 2021, the Company implemented a flexible model that allows employees the option to continue to work from home, with the exception of essential employees whose roles require them to be on site. The Company maintains office space available for team meetings, collaboration and other critical in-person events.
 My Career—DFIN is committed to helping employees grow their skills and capabilities. To facilitate that goal, in 2021, the Company launched a new career framework for U.S. employees that helps them make informed choices about their skill development and career growth. The career framework includes a "Career Map" that shows every role in the Company by level. This helps employees understand how their job fits into the overall structure and shows the various pathways for advancement.
 My Health—DFIN offers comprehensive health and benefits including medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance and vision insurance. The Company's programs focus on physical health, emotional/mental health and encourages all employees to take ownership of their wellbeing. Program highlights include topical webinars, targeted programs (e.g., tobacco cessation, diabetes management and weight management) and employee assistance programs.

   My Money—DFIN offers competitive base salaries and a variety of compensation programs to reward performance relative to key strategic and financial metrics. The Company also cultivates a "pay for performance" culture in which when the Company does well, the Company shares those rewards with employees. Based on the Company's strong fiscal year 2020 results, in March 2021, the Company paid a performance bonus to all employees who were not eligible for another variable compensation program. DFIN also announced that beginning in 2022, there will be a 401(k) match of 50 cents for every dollar an employee contributes up to 6% of eligible compensation and the Company has the ability to contribute a discretionary match that would apply to employee contributions, based on the Company's performance, as determined by the Company. Other financially focused benefits available include accident and critical illness insurance, life and disability insurance, health savings account (which includes a company contribution), flexible spending accounts and a group legal services plan.
 Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DEI”)—Creating an inclusive community in which all voices are heard is key to the Company's success. In 2021, DFIN launched a DEI Council comprised of individuals with various backgrounds and experience across the organization, with a mission "to be a strategic resource to DFIN leadership to help keep a sustained focus on DEI. We aspire to foster a culture where all employees feel valued, respected and heard. Inclusivity will enable DFIN to attract and retain the very best talent."
 The pillars of education and awareness, advocacy and support and fairness and equality will continue to guide the actions that are aligned to the Company's goals and support fostering an inclusive environment. In 2021, the Company introduced voluntary self-identification for gender identity and sexual orientation.
 DFIN has made progress in bringing more diverse perspectives to leadership. Since the beginning of 2021, approximately 59% of all U.S. hires and promotions at the manager level and above have been women or people of color. Women or people of color constitute approximately 25% and 13% of the Company’s Board of Directors, respectively. In 2021, approximately 36% of DFIN’s U.S. employees in managerial roles were women and approximately 24% of its U.S. employees in managerial roles were people of color.
The Company is committed to paying its employees in a fair and equitable way. In 2021, the Company retained a compensation consultant to review its pay structures against market practices. Additionally, DFIN has a rigorous internal compensation review process. The Company is also committed to increasing gender and racial diversity at all levels of the Company through recruiting, training and promotion opportunities, especially at the management level. In 2022, a portion of executive performance incentive pay will be tied to achieving that objective.
Training and Development—DFIN invests in its employees’ skills and professional development by offering virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching and career development opportunities. In 2021, approximately 55% of employees engaged in self-directed learning and development activities through the Company's on-demand learning platform. DFIN provides its employees with curated and targeted learning pathways for leadership, finance, and technical roles as well as safety, compliance and equipment-related training. DFIN continues to focus on leadership development and piloted cohort leadership development programs aligned to the Company's values and leadership behaviors.
 In addition to personal training and development, the Company requires employees to complete a series of mandatory courses in data protection, principles of ethical business conduct, harassment awareness and anti-corruption. In 2021, the Company achieved more than 99% completion of these required courses.
 Employee Experience and Retention—DFIN gains insight into what matters to its employees, what motivates them and how best to reach them by regularly surveying employees on culture, from wellbeing to career development.
 In a 2021 survey sponsored by the newly created DEI Council to gauge employee sentiment, a majority of employees who responded said they feel comfortable being their authentic, whole selves at work, and that DFIN cultivates a culture where people of all background are welcome and valued. The Company consistently tracked whether employees felt treated with dignity and respect and whether employees felt proud to work at DFIN. Over three separate surveys in 2021, employees consistently reported that they "almost always" felt treated with dignity and respect by their managers and leaders and "almost always" felt proud to work at DFIN.
 The Company conducts town hall meetings, quarterly all-employee calls and frequent internal communications. In 2021, DFIN also implemented a social recognition platform to cultivate a culture of recognition and appreciation, while bringing connectivity to the employees in a virtual environment.
   Health and Safety—The health, safety and well-being of its employees is DFIN’s highest priority and a core element of its culture and the Company believes everyone contributes to a safe and healthy work environment no matter their role in the organization. DFIN’s Environmental, Health and Safety Management System aligns with ISO 14001 and 45001. The Company sets annual leading and lagging indicators to improve its sustainability performance and in 2021 achieved a workforce total recordable incident rate of 0.32 (per 200,000 hours worked).
The Company’s manufacturing employees participate in robust safety committees and quarterly roundtables to share best practices transparently and conduct a Speak Up for Safety employee recognition program for identifying near misses. In 2021, the manufacturing workforce achieved a 99% completion rate for job-specific safety training. DFIN also observes Safety Month globally each June and in 2021 focused on COVID-19 vaccination benefits, cyber safety, ergonomics and emotional health. Results from the annual Safety Monthly Survey showed that 84% of employees who responded believe their safety, health and well-being is a priority at DFIN. Finally, in November 2021, 57 employees were nominated for a Safety Pinnacle Award. These awards recognize the best-in-class contributions of employees from across the Company who foster a culture of safety, health and well-being in the workplace.
As the pandemic persists, the Company continues to focus on safety and health, especially among its manufacturing employees who continue work onsite. DFIN implemented a company-wide COVID-19 Protocol for reporting suspected and/or positive cases, contact tracing, communications and employee testing to help prevent workplace exposure.
 Climate
 In 2021, the Company sourced 100% of the electricity used by its print manufacturing facilities from the purchase of renewable energy credits. The Corporate Responsibility and Governance Committee has broad oversight of environmental, social and governance issues, which includes climate-related risks and opportunities. Due to the nature of the business, DFIN does not anticipate any material impact from climate-related regulations.
