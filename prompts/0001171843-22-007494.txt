Item 1.         BUSINESS
Overview
 
Northern Technologies International Corporation (NTIC) develops and markets proprietary, environmentally beneficial products and services in over 65 countries either directly or via a network of subsidiaries, joint ventures, independent distributors, and agents. NTIC’s primary business is corrosion prevention products and services, marketed mainly under the ZERUST® brand. NTIC has been selling its proprietary ZERUST® products and services to the automotive, electronics, electrical, mechanical, military, and retail consumer markets for almost 50 years and, more recently, has also expanded into the oil and gas industry. Additionally, NTIC markets and sells a portfolio of proprietary bio-based and certified compostable (fully biodegradable) polymer resin compounds and finished products under the Natur-Tec® brand. These products are intended to reduce NTIC’s customers’ carbon footprint and provide environmentally sound waste disposal options.
 
NTIC’s ZERUST® rust and corrosion inhibiting products include plastic and paper packaging, liquids, coatings, rust removers, cleaners, and diffusers as well as engineered solutions designed specifically for the oil and gas industry. NTIC also offers worldwide, on-site, technical consulting for rust and corrosion prevention issues. NTIC’s technical service consultants work directly with the end users of NTIC’s ZERUST® rust and corrosion inhibiting products to analyze their specific needs and develop systems to meet their performance requirements. In North America, NTIC sells its ZERUST® corrosion prevention solutions through a network of independent distributors and agents supported by a direct sales force.
 
Internationally, NTIC sells its ZERUST® corrosion prevention solutions through its wholly-owned subsidiary in China, NTIC (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (NTIC China), starting September 1, 2021 its wholly-owned subsidiary in India, HNTI Ltd. (Zerust India), its majority-owned joint venture holding company for NTIC’s joint venture investments in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region, NTI Asean LLC (NTI Asean), certain majority-owned and wholly-owned subsidiaries, and joint venture arrangements in North America, Europe, and Asia. NTIC also sells products directly to its European joint venture partners through its wholly-owned subsidiary in Germany, NTIC Europe GmbH (NTI Europe).
 
One of NTIC’s strategic initiatives is to expand into and penetrate other markets for its ZERUST® corrosion prevention technologies. Consequently, for the past several years, NTIC has focused significant sales and marketing efforts on the oil and gas industry, as the infrastructure that supports that industry is typically constructed using metals that are highly susceptible to corrosion. NTIC believes that its ZERUST® corrosion prevention solutions will minimize maintenance downtime on critical oil and gas industry infrastructure, extend the life of such infrastructure, and reduce the risk of environmental pollution due to leaks caused by corrosion.
 
NTIC markets and sells its ZERUST® rust and corrosion prevention solutions to customers in the oil and gas industry across several countries either directly, through its subsidiaries, or through its joint venture partners and other strategic partners. The sale of ZERUST® corrosion prevention solutions to customers in the oil and gas industry typically involves long sales cycles, often including multi-year trial periods with each customer and a slow integration process thereafter.
 
Natur-Tec® bio-based and compostable plastics are manufactured using NTIC’s patented and/or proprietary technologies and are intended to replace conventional petroleum-based plastics.  The Natur-Tec® biopolymer resin compound portfolio includes formulations that have been optimized for a variety of applications, including blown-film extrusion, extrusion coating, injection molding, and engineered plastics.  These resin compounds are certified to be fully biodegradable in a commercial composting environment and are currently being used to produce finished products, including can liners, shopping and grocery bags, lawn and leaf bags, branded apparel packaging bags and accessories, and various foodservice items, such as disposable cutlery, drinking straws, food-handling gloves, and coated paper products.  In North America, NTIC markets its Natur-Tec® resin compounds and finished products primarily through a network of regional and national distributors as well as independent agents.  NTIC continues to see significant opportunities for finished bioplastic products and, therefore, continues to strengthen and expand its North American distribution network for finished Natur-Tec® bioplastic products. 
 
Internationally, NTIC sells its Natur-Tec® resin compounds and finished products both directly and through its wholly-owned subsidiary in China and majority-owned subsidiaries in India and Sri Lanka, and through distributors and certain joint ventures.

In connection with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we terminated our Russian joint venture, Mostnic-Zerust, in May 2022, and believe this will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, given the immateriality of this entity.
 
NTIC receives funds from its joint ventures as fees received for services that NTIC provides to its joint ventures and as dividend distributions. The fees for services provided to joint ventures are determined based on either a flat fee or a percentage of sales depending on local laws and tax regulations. With respect to NTIC’s joint venture in Germany (EXCOR), NTIC recognizes an agreed upon quarterly fee for services. NTIC recognizes equity income from each joint venture based on the overall profitability of the joint venture. Such profitability is subject to variability from quarter to quarter, which, in turn, subjects NTIC’s earnings to variability from quarter to quarter. The profits of each joint venture are shared by the respective joint venture owners in accordance with their respective ownership percentages. NTIC typically directly or indirectly owns 50% or less of each of its joint venture entities and, thus, does not control the decisions of these entities regarding whether dividends are paid and, if so, what amount is paid in a given year. The payment of a dividend by an entity is determined by a joint vote of the owners and is not at the sole discretion of NTIC.
 
NTIC accounts for the investments and financial results of its joint ventures in its consolidated financial statements utilizing the equity method of accounting. NTIC considers EXCOR to be individually significant to NTIC’s consolidated assets and income as of August 31, 2022 and 2021. Therefore, NTIC provides certain additional information regarding this joint venture in the notes to NTIC’s consolidated financial statements and in this section of this report. For more information regarding NTIC’s joint ventures and their effect on NTIC’s operating results, see NTIC’s consolidated financial statements in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report.

Products
 
NTIC derives revenues directly and/or indirectly through its subsidiaries and joint ventures from two reportable business segments based on products sold, customer base, and distribution center: ZERUST® corrosion prevention solutions and Natur-Tec® resin compounds and finished products.
ZERUST® Corrosion Prevention Solutions. In fiscal 2022, 77.5% of NTIC’s consolidated net sales were derived from developing, manufacturing and marketing ZERUST® rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services. NTIC’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022 included $57,459,382 in sales of ZERUST® rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services, an increase of 26.1% from such sales in fiscal 2021. Corrosion not only damages the appearance of metal products and components but also negatively impacts their mechanical performance. This applies to the rusting of ferrous metals (iron and steel) and the deterioration by oxidation of nonferrous metals (aluminum, copper, brass, etc.).  NTIC’s ZERUST® corrosion prevention solutions include plastic and paper packaging, powders, liquids, coatings, rust removers, cleaners, diffusers, and engineered solutions for the oil and gas industry as well as technical corrosion management and consulting services.
 
Plastic and Paper Packaging. NTIC’s ZERUST® packaging products contain proprietary chemical formulations that continuously release an invisible, odorless and non-toxic vapor that forms a passivating layer on any metal surfaces it comes in contact with and thereby inhibits rust and corrosion. The corrosion inhibiting protection is maintained only as long as the metal products to be protected remain enclosed within the ZERUST® packaging. Electron scanning shows that once metal products are removed from the ZERUST® packaging, the ZERUST® protective layer dissipates from the contents’ surfaces within two hours, leaving a clean, dry, and corrosion-free metal component. This mechanism of corrosion protection enables NTIC’s customers to easily package metal objects for rust-free shipment and/or long-term storage. Furthermore, by eliminating costly greasing and degreasing processes and/or significantly reducing the use of certain coatings to inhibit corrosion, NTIC’s ZERUST® corrosion prevention solutions provide customers significant savings as compared to traditional methods of corrosion prevention in terms of labor, material, and capital expenditures for equipment to apply, remove, and dispose of oils and greases, as well as environmental, health and safety benefits provided by not having to handle and work with hazardous chemicals.
 
NTIC was first in the world to develop the means of infusing volatile corrosion inhibiting chemical compounds (VCIs) into polyethylene and polypropylene resins. Combining ZERUST® chemical compounds with polyethylene and polypropylene resins permitted NTIC to introduce a line of plastic packaging products in the form of low and high-density polyethylene bags and shroud film, including stretch, shrink, skin, and bubble cushioning film, thereby giving customers the ability to ship and store ferrous, nonferrous, and mixed-metal products in a clean, dry, and corrosion-free condition, at an overall savings in total process costs. In addition to plastic packaging, NTIC has also developed VCI compounds to imbue kraft paper, corrugated cardboard, solid fiber, and chipboard packaging materials with corrosion protection properties. NTIC’s ZERUST® plastic and paper packaging products come in various thicknesses, strength enhancements, protection types, shapes, and sizes. This product line also includes items such as ZERUST® gun cases, car covers, and tool-drawer liners, which are targeted at retail consumers.
 
Liquids and Coatings. NTIC’s corrosion prevention solutions include a line of metal surface treatment liquids and coatings, which are oil, water, or bio-solvent based, and are marketed under brand names including Axxatec™, Axxanol™, and Z-Maxx™. These liquids and coatings provide powerful protection in aggressively corrosive environments, such as salt air, high humidity, and/or high temperatures. Products are formulated for most metal types and protection levels. For exceptionally harsh environments, customers may choose to use a combination of NTIC’s liquids and coatings with ZERUST® plastic and/or paper products to achieve robust corrosion protection during manufacturing, shipping, and warehousing stages.
Rust Removers and Cleaners. NTIC also sells rust removal and cleaning products, under the Axxaclean™ brand name, designed to restore rusty parts to a usable condition without the use of labor-intensive, abrasive cleaners that damage surfaces and commonly fail to remove rust from complex metal surfaces, like the teeth of small gears.
Diffusers. NTIC’s corrosion prevention solutions include a line of corrosion inhibiting vapor diffusers, such as ZERUST® ActivPak®, ZERUST® ICT® Vapor Capsules, ZERUST® ICT® Plastabs®, ZERUST® ICT® Cor-Tabs®, ZERUST® ICT® Pipe Strip, and ZERUST® ICT® Tube Strip. These diffusers are designed to protect metals within enclosures, like switch gearboxes and electronics cabinets, or can be used as extra protection when added to ZERUST® packaging products. Diffusers work by permeating the interior air of an enclosure with an invisible and odorless corrosion inhibiting vapor that settles as a protective layer on all metal surfaces that are within the range of a specific “radius of protection” for a period of one or two years depending on the product model. This invisible and dry protective layer revaporizes and dissipates into the air upon removal of a diffuser from an enclosure, leaving all surfaces clean, dry, residue-free, and corrosion-free.

Z-CIS® Technical Services. As an on-going effort to help NTIC’s customers improve and control their corrosion management processes, NTIC markets and offers unique corrosion management and consulting services to target customers. This ZERUST® corrosion inhibition system (known as Z-CIS®) leverages NTIC’s global network to dispatch highly-trained technical service engineers to customer sites to solve complex corrosion problems. Several major automotive companies and their automotive parts suppliers have used NTIC’s Z‑CIS® system.
ZERUST® Corrosion Prevention Solutions Designed Specifically for the Oil and Gas Industry.  NTIC has developed proprietary engineered corrosion inhibiting solutions specifically to mitigate the types of corrosion that commonly form on the capital assets used in the petroleum and chemical process industries and has targeted the sale of these ZERUST® corrosion solutions to potential customers in the oil and gas industry.  NTIC’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022 included $4,608,232 in sales made to customers in the oil and gas industry, an increase of 21.5% from such sales in fiscal 2021. On September 19, 2022, NTIC announced the signing of an initial contract with BP Exploration (Caspian Sea) Limited p.l.c. to supply chemical corrosion protection services for 12 storage tanks through December 2025, representing the largest contract to date for oil and gas storage tank solutions. While NTIC believes this shows increased acceptance of corrosion solutions for the oil and gas industry, NTIC anticipates that its sales of ZERUST® products and services into the oil and gas industry will continue to remain subject to significant volatility, specifically due to economic factors, such as potential crude oil price changes and global supply/demand churn. NTIC anticipates that its sales of ZERUST® products and services into the oil and gas industry may be subject to additional volatility due to uncertainty caused by certain environmental policies and priorities of the current administration. Demand for ZERUST® oil and gas products around the world depends primarily on market acceptance and the reach of NTIC’s distribution network. Because of the typical size of individual orders and overall size of NTIC’s net sales derived from sales of oil and gas products, the timing of one or more orders can materially affect NTIC’s sales compared to prior fiscal year period sales. Projects in South America, Europe, the Middle East, and South East Asia are still a small but growing, strategically important part of the sales growth picture. 
 
The infrastructure/assets that support the oil and gas industry are predominantly constructed using metals that are highly susceptible to corrosion. The industrial environment at these facilities usually contains compounds, including sulfides and chlorides, which cause aggressive corrosion. This problem affects the service life and safety of pipelines, petroleum storage tanks, spare parts in long-term storage, coastal/offshore assets, and other critical equipment. In addition to the costs associated with the replacement of parts and structures, maintenance and repairs, and product loss, there are significant economic losses associated with critical infrastructure being down for repair and maintenance.  Furthermore, there are also considerable health, safety, and environmental risks caused by corrosion that can greatly increase economic losses. While the industry predominantly uses various paints/coatings, engineered alloys, cathodic protection, etc. to mitigate corrosion, there are several situations where such options are not feasible and, in many such cases, NTIC believes that its ZERUST® oil and gas corrosion prevention solutions are more effective at minimizing maintenance downtime on critical oil and gas industry infrastructure, extend the life of such infrastructure, and reduce the risk of environmental pollution due to leaks caused by corrosion.
 
NTIC’s rust and corrosion inhibiting products for the oil and gas industry include ZERUST® Flange Savers®, ZERUST® ReCAST-SSB solutions, and ZERUST® chemicals, including Zerion powders and gels, in addition to many of the standard industrial ZERUST® rust and corrosion inhibiting products previously described.
 
ZERUST® Flange Savers® are specially designed covers that have been impregnated with a proprietary ZERUST® inhibitor formulation to provide corrosion protection for flanges, valves, and welded joints.  Oil and gas pipeline segments are connected by flanges and welded joints of varying sizes, designs, and materials.  These connection points often corrode under aggressive industrial environments and harsh operating conditions, thereby causing costly maintenance, operational, and safety problems.  ZERUST® Flange Savers® are available in various sizes to accommodate different pipe diameters, pressure ratings, and international standards for pipeline valves and flanges.
 
ZERUST® ReCAST-SSB solutions protect the Soil Side Bottoms (SSB) of aboveground storage tanks through a variety of unique and highly effective delivery systems designed by the Zerust Oil & Gas team to deliver proprietary Zerion FVS corrosion inhibitor to spaces under tank bottoms that are susceptible to significant corrosion.  Tank bottoms are typically made of steel plates, which are in direct contact with a foundation surface that may be concrete, sand/soil, or asphalt/bitumen.  It is typically not possible to protect this underside surface with traditional coatings.  Cathodic protection (CP) systems can only provide partial protection, but also have significant limitations that cause failures well ahead of the expected service life of a tank. The ZERUST® solutions provide effective protection even to areas that cannot be addressed with CP.  These are engineered solutions where each system is tailored to a customer’s requirements depending on factors including the tank foundation design, specific environmental conditions, and tank diameter.

Natur-Tec® Resin Compounds and Finished Products. NTIC manufactures and sells a broad range of bioplastic packaging solutions, including bio-based and certified compostable (fully biodegradable) polymer resin compounds, and finished products under the Natur-Tec® brand.  NTIC’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022 included $16,699,508 in sales of Natur-Tec® resins and finished products, an increase of 52.7% compared to sales in fiscal 2021. Market drivers such as volatile petroleum prices, reduced dependence on foreign oil, reduced carbon footprints, requirements by multinational brands for sustainable packaging solutions that meet Circular Economy and environmentally responsible end-of-life disposal mandates, and concerns about plastic residue in the environment have led to heightened interest in using sustainable, bio-based and renewable plant-biomass resources for the manufacture of plastics and industrial products.  Plastics that are fully biodegradable in commercial composting or anaerobic digestor systems allow the safe and effective conversion of these plastics to carbon dioxide, water, and fertilizer at the end of their service life.  Increased environmental and sustainability awareness at the corporate and consumer level, improved technical properties and product functionality, as well as recent foreign, state, and local governmental regulations banning the use of conventional plastics or mandating the use of certain biodegradable or compostable products, including regulations in China, India and California, have also fueled this interest in bio-based and biodegradable-compostable plastics.  The term “bio-plastics” encompasses a broad category of plastics that are either bio-based, which means derived from renewable resources such as corn or cellulosic/plant material or blends thereof, or are engineered to be fully commercially compostable, or both. 
 
Natur-Tec® resins and finished products sales in North America and finished product sales at NTIC’s majority-owned subsidiary in India and at NTIC’s subsidiary in China, experienced reduced demand globally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on demand from many large users of bioplastics, including college campuses, stadiums, arenas, restaurants, and corporate office complexes. Additionally, demand for apparel packaging solutions was impacted by ongoing COVID- related lockdowns and supply-chain bottlenecks in Asia. In fiscal 2022, NTIC experienced a significant recovery in many of these areas to pre-pandemic levels, but still expects some of these customers will be the last businesses to fully re-open and operate at full pre-pandemic capacities, and accordingly, anticipates that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely affect sales of Natur-Tec® products into fiscal 2023.
 
Resin Compounds.  Natur-Tec® resin compounds are produced by blending commonly available base resins, such as Ecoflex® from BASF, Ingeo® PLA from NatureWorks LLC, and Luminy® from Total-Corbion with organic and inorganic fillers and proprietary polymer modifiers and compatibilizers using NTIC’s proprietary and patented ReX Process.  In this process, biodegradable polymers, natural polymers made from renewable, plant-biomass resources, and organic and inorganic materials are reactively blended in the presence of proprietary compatibilizers and polymer modifiers to produce bio-based and/or compostable polymer resin formulations that exhibit unique and stable morphology. Natur-Tec® resin compounds are engineered for high performance, ease of processing, and reduced cost compared to most other bio-plastic materials and can be processed by converters using conventional plastic manufacturing processes and equipment.  
 
    6 

  

Natur-Tec® resin compounds are sold in several grades tailored for a variety of applications, such as blown-film extrusion, profile extrusion, thermoforming, extrusion coating, and injection molding. 
 
Natur-Tec® flexible film resin compounds are fully commercially compostable and meet the requirements of international standards for compostable plastics, such as ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) D6400 (U.S.), EN 13432 (European standards for products and services by European Committee for Standardization), and ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 17088, and are certified as 100% compostable by organizations including the BPI (Biodegradable Products Institute) in the United States and TÜV Austria in Europe.  Natur-Tec® film resin compounds can be used to produce film for applications, such as bags, including compost bags, lawn and leaf bags, carry-out bags, agricultural film, and consumer and industrial packaging.  Natur-Tec® film resin compounds are also used to produce bags and covers for branded apparel packaging and to manufacture specialty foodservice items, such as compostable drinking straws, thermoformed lids and disposable food-handling gloves. 
 
The Natur-Tec® compostable extrusion coating resin compounds are bio-based and biodegradable and are designed to replace conventional plastic materials for extrusion coating applications.  Natur-Tec® extrusion coating resin compounds are manufactured using sustainable and renewable resources, per the ASTM D6866 standard, which allows companies and consumers the opportunity to reduce or neutralize their carbon footprint and are designed to meet the requirements of international standards for compostable plastics, such as ASTM D6400.  Natur-Tec® extrusion coating resin compounds provide good adhesion to paper, an excellent print surface, and good heat seal strength and the coating material is suitable for food contact applications, including both hot and cold applications.  Natur-Tec® extrusion coating resin compounds can be used for coating paper and paperboards for the manufacture of disposable cups, plates, and other foodservice items.
 
The Natur-Tec® compostable injection molding resin compounds are bio-based and compostable and are designed to replace conventional plastic materials for injection molded plastic applications.  Natur-Tec® compostable injection molding resin compounds are manufactured using sustainable and renewable resources, per the ASTM D6866 standard, and are designed to meet the requirements of international standards for compostable plastics, such as ASTM D6400 and EN 13432.  Natur-Tec® compostable injection molding resin compounds can be used for injection molded plastic applications, such as cutlery, pens, hangers, containers, and packaging.  Natur-Tec® bio-based injection molding resin compounds are made with at least 90% bio-based/renewable resource-based materials, per the ASTM D6866 standard, and are meant to enhance sustainability by replacing petroleum-based plastics.  Natur-Tec® bio-based injection molding resin compounds exhibit the same properties as conventional plastic materials and can be used in applications such as automotive components, consumer goods, electronics, medical products, furniture, and packaging.
 
Finished Products.  Natur-Tec® finished products include totally biodegradable and compostable trash bags, agricultural film, and other single-use disposable products, such as food and consumer goods packaging currently marketed under the Natur-Bag® brand. The Natur-Bag® product line offers 15 different compostable trash bag sizes, from 3-gallon to 96-gallon, as well as shopper bags, produce bags and gloves.  The bags are available in various SKU configurations, including retail packs that are sold to the consumer either through retail outlets or through online stores and industrial case packs that are sold to commercial and industrial customers primarily through wholesalers and distributors.  The Natur-Bag® products are manufactured from the Natur-Tec® flexible film resin compounds and thus are fully biodegradable and compostable. These products are certified fully commercially compostable and carry the BPI Compostable logo in the United States and the TÜV Austria OK Compost logo in Europe.  Furthermore, these products were also independently tested and approved for use in organic waste diversion systems by Cedar Grove, one of the largest compost operators in the United States.
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
 
ZERUST® Corrosion Prevention Solutions. In the United States, NTIC markets its ZERUST® rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services, including its products designed for the oil and gas industry, principally to industrial users in the automotive, electronics, electrical, mechanical, military, retail consumer, and oil and gas markets by a direct sales force and through a network of independent distributors, manufacturer’s sales representatives, and strategic partners. Prior to placing an order, NTIC’s technical service consultants work directly with the end users of NTIC’s ZERUST® products to analyze their specific corrosion prevention needs and develop systems to meet their performance requirements.
 
    7 

  

Internationally, NTIC has entered into a series of joint ventures with foreign partners (either directly or through a holding company). NTIC receives fees for providing technical support, marketing assistance, and other services to its joint ventures based primarily on the net sales of the individual joint ventures in accordance with the terms of the joint venture arrangements. Such services include consulting, legal, insurance, technical, and marketing services.
 
In China, NTIC sells its products and services through NTIC China. NTIC has wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries to conduct its business in Brazil, Mexico, Vietnam and Singapore. In addition, effective as of September 1, 2021, NTIC purchased the remaining 50% ownership interest in its Indian joint venture, HNTI Limited, and has continued selling its ZERUST products in India through this wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
With respect to the sales and marketing of ZERUST® rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services to the oil and gas industry, NTIC uses a combination of direct sales personnel, independent sales agents, and its joint venture network. In addition, in an attempt to penetrate the oil and gas industry within certain markets more quickly, NTIC has entered into various agreements with specific organizations that have existing long-term relationships with key oil and gas industry clients. NTIC also engages in certain direct marketing activities to build its brand within the oil and gas industry, such as traditional advertising and direct mail campaigns and presence and participation at selected key trade shows and technical forums. Additionally, NTIC has worked to adapt its marketing activities in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. NTIC continues to believe the sale of its ZERUST® corrosion prevention solutions to customers in the oil and gas industry will involve long sales cycles, likely including multi-year trial periods with each user and a slow integration process thereafter. 
 
Natur-Tec® Resin Compounds and Finished Products.  In the United States, NTIC markets its Natur-Tec® resin compounds and finished products through a network of national and regional distributors and independent manufacturer’s sales representatives and two NTIC direct sales employees as of August 31, 2022. Target customers for Natur-Tec® finished products include individual consumers as well as commercial and institutional organizations, such as corporations and government agencies, and educational organizations, such as universities and school districts. NTIC is also targeting key national and regional retailers utilizing independent sales agents.  Target customers for Natur-Tec® resin compounds include plastics converters and foodservice ware brands that would purchase Natur-Tec® resin compounds to manufacture and sell their own finished bio-based and compostable end products, such as film, bags, and cutlery.  Additionally, NTIC has targeted retailers and customers that may have applications for our products related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2022, the State of California passed a law intended to reduce single-use plastics. Notably, the bill provides that, by 2032, all packaging must be recyclable or compostable. Accordingly, NTIC expects the market in California for bio-plastic packaging solutions to grow substantially in the coming decade.
 
Internationally, NTIC uses Natur-Tec India, Natur Tec Lanka, NTIC China and a network of international distributors to market its Natur-Tec® resin compounds and finished products. The government of India recently announced a phased ban on the manufacture and sale of single-use plastics beginning in July 2022. The first phase bans earbuds and plastic sticks used in balloons and ice cream. The second phase bans plastic cigarette packets and plastic bags less than 100 microns thick. Notably, compostable plastics are exempt from this ban. Accordingly, NTIC expects the market in India for bio-plastic packaging solutions to continue to grow substantially. Similarly, despite slower than anticipated sales of Natur-Tec® products in China due to ongoing restrictions and shutdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, NTIC anticipates that sales will grow in China in fiscal 2023 in connection with China’s ban on single-use plastic utensils, bags and certain other single-use plastic items, which took effect in January 2021.
 
NTIC’s Natur-Tec® resin compounds and finished products are produced at facilities in India, China, Malaysia, and the United States. NTIC’s Natur-Tec® resin compounds can be shipped to manufacturing facilities around the world, where they then can be converted into finished products, such as film or piece of cutlery.  NTIC’s Natur-Tec® finished products are manufactured using NTIC’s Natur-Tec® resin compounds by select sub-contractors. 
 
Competition
 
ZERUST® Corrosion Prevention Solutions. While NTIC is unaware of any third parties with which NTIC competes on a worldwide basis with respect to its corrosion prevention solutions, NTIC does compete with several third parties on a regional basis. NTIC evaluates competing rust and corrosion inhibiting products on an ongoing basis. Some of NTIC’s competitors are established companies that may have financial resources, marketing capabilities, distribution networks and other resources substantially greater than those of NTIC. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than NTIC. With respect to its rust and corrosion inhibiting products, NTIC competes on the basis of product innovation, quality, reliability, product support, customer service, reputation, and price. Some of NTIC’s competitors may have achieved significant market acceptance of their competing products and brand recognition. NTIC, however, believes it has an advantage over most of its competitors as a result of NTIC’s technical innovation and its value-added services. NTIC attempts to provide its customers with the highest level of technical service and applications engineering in addition to ZERUST® rust and corrosion inhibiting products. Nonetheless, the commoditization of certain of NTIC’s ZERUST® rust and corrosion inhibiting products has led, and may continue to lead, to lower prices and lower margins on such products. In addition, because certain barriers to entry are low, additional competitors may emerge, which likely would lead to the further commoditization of NTIC’s rust and corrosion inhibiting products.

With respect to the sales and marketing of ZERUST® rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services to the oil and gas industry, NTIC uses a combination of direct sales personnel, independent sales agents, and its joint venture network.  In addition, in an attempt to penetrate the oil and gas industry within certain markets more quickly, NTIC has entered into various agreements with specific organizations that have existing long-term relationships with key oil and gas industry clients.  NTIC also engages in certain direct marketing activities to build its brand within the oil and gas industry, such as traditional advertising and direct mail campaigns and presence and participation at selected key trade shows and technical forums.  NTIC continues to believe the sale of its ZERUST® corrosion prevention solutions to customers in the oil and gas industry will involve long sales cycles, likely including multi-year trial periods with each user and a slow integration process thereafter.  
 
Natur-Tec® Resin Compounds and Finished Products. With respect to NTIC’s Natur-Tec® resin compounds and finished products, NTIC competes with several established companies that have been producing and selling similar products for a significantly longer time period and have significantly more sales, more extensive and effective distribution networks, and better brand recognition than NTIC.  Most of these companies also have substantially more financial and other resources than NTIC.  NTIC competes on the basis of performance, brand awareness, distribution network, product availability, product offering, improved shelf life, place of manufacture, and price.  Because of price competition, NTIC’s margins on its Natur-Tec® resin compounds and finished products are lower than its margins on its ZERUST® corrosion prevention solutions.  NTIC also has encountered in the past and could continue to encounter additional supply constraints for the base polymer resins used to manufacture NTIC’s Natur-Tec® resin compounds and finished products since there are a limited number of suppliers of such base polymer resins and limited capacity for their production. 
Research and Development
 
NTIC’s research and development activities are directed at improving existing products, developing new products, reducing costs, and improving quality assurance through improved testing of NTIC’s products. NTIC’s internal research and development activities are conducted at its facilities located in Circle Pines, Minnesota; Beachwood, Ohio; and Dresden, Germany under the direction of internationally known scientists and research institutes under exclusive contract with NTIC with respect to the subject of their respective research efforts. EXCOR has established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Excor Korrosionsforschung GmbH, to conduct research into new fields of corrosion inhibiting packaging and the applications engineering of such products in conjunction with NTIC’s domestic research and development operations. With respect to NTIC’s Natur-Tec® resin compounds and finished products, Ramani Narayan, Ph.D., a current director of NTIC and Distinguished Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering & Materials Science at Michigan State University, provides his expertise and technical support to NTIC.
 
NTIC anticipates that it will spend between $4,400,000 and $4,800,000 in fiscal 2023 on research and development activities.
 
Intellectual Property Rights
 
NTIC’s success depends and will continue to depend in part upon its ability to maintain patent and trademark protection for its products and processes, to preserve its proprietary information and trade secrets, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. NTIC’s policy is to attempt to protect its technology by, among other things, filing patent applications and trademark applications and vigorously preserving the trade secrets covering its technology and other intellectual property rights.

In 1980, NTIC developed and patented the first polyolefin (plastic) based industrial corrosion inhibiting packing material in the world. The U.S. patent granted under this patent application became the most important intellectual property right in NTIC’s history.  This patent expired in 2000.  NTIC has since filed for 12 letters of patent in the United States covering various corrosion inhibiting technologies, systems, and applications and now owns several patents in these areas. These patents and patent applications have been extended to the countries of strategic relevance to NTIC, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, India, Korea, Mexico, Russia, and Taiwan.  In addition, EXCOR owns several patents in the area covering various corrosion inhibiting technologies and has also applied for new patents on proprietary new corrosion inhibiting technologies.  NTIC is also seeking additional patent protection covering various host materials into which its corrosion inhibiting additives and other protective features can be incorporated, proprietary new process technologies, and chemical formulations outside the area of corrosion protection.  NTIC owns several patents outside the area of corrosion protection both in the United States and in countries of strategic relevance to NTIC, including the above-noted countries. 
 
In addition to seeking patent protection, NTIC maintains an extensive portfolio of trademarks in countries where NTIC has a presence directly or through its subsidiaries and joint ventures.  NTIC continuously pursues new trademark applications of strategic interest worldwide.  NTIC owns the following U.S. registered trademarks: NTI®, NTI & Globe Design®, ZERUST®, EXCOR®, ICT®, Z-CIS®, COR TAB®, PLASTABS®, NATUR-TEC®, NATUR-TEC & Design®, NATUR-BAG® and NATUR-WARE®, ZERION®, AUTOFOG®, FLANGE SAVER®, and ACTIVPAK®.  NTIC also has a registered trademark on the use of the Color Yellow with respect to corrosion inhibiting packaging.  Furthermore, NTI®, ZERUST®, EXCOR®, the Color Yellow®, and NTI ASEAN®, as well as other marks, have been registered in the European Union, and several new applications are pending.
 
NTIC requires its employees, consultants, and advisors with access to its confidential information, including trade secrets, to execute confidentiality agreements upon commencement of their employment or consulting relationships with NTIC.  These agreements generally provide that all confidential information NTIC develops or makes known to the individual during the course of the individual’s employment or consulting relationship with NTIC must be kept confidential by the individual and not disclosed to any third parties.  NTIC also requires all of its employees and consultants who perform research and development for NTIC to execute agreements that generally provide that all inventions developed by these individuals during their employment or service arrangement with NTIC will fall under NTIC’s proprietary intellectual property rights. 
 
Manufacturing
 
NTIC’s ZERUST® rust and corrosion inhibiting products are manufactured according to NTIC’s specifications primarily by selected independent sub-contractors under trade secrecy agreements and/or license agreements. In addition, NTIC manufactures select ZERUST® rust and corrosion inhibiting products, consisting primarily of liquids and powders, at its corporate headquarters location in Circle Pines, Minnesota.  
 
NTIC’s Natur-Tec® resin compounds and finished products are produced at facilities in India, China, Malaysia, and the United States. NTIC’s Natur-Tec® resin compounds can be shipped to manufacturing facilities around the world, where they then can be converted into finished products, such as film or piece of cutlery. NTIC’s Natur-Tec® finished products are manufactured using NTIC’s Natur-Tec® resin compounds by select sub-contractors.
 
NTIC is ISO 9001 certified with respect to the manufacturing of its products.  NTIC believes that the process of ISO 9001 certification serves as an excellent total quality management tool, enabling NTIC to ensure consistency in the performance of its products.  In addition, because potential customers may prefer or require manufacturers to have achieved ISO certification, such ISO certifications may provide NTIC with certain competitive advantages.
 
Availability of Raw Materials
 
NTIC does not typically carry excess quantities of raw materials because of historically widespread availability for such materials from various suppliers.  However, with respect to its Natur-Tec® resin compounds and finished products, there are a limited number of suppliers of the base resins used to manufacture the resin compounds and finished products.  Additionally, there is growing demand for these base resins, which has caused cost increases and, more recently, supply issues.  In the past and during fiscal year 2022, NTIC has experienced some delays in obtaining these base resins due to production slowdowns, which resulted from manufacturing issues, labor shortages and power restrictions in China, freight container shortages, and the war in Ukraine. Due to supply chain disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and otherwise, NTIC experienced longer lead times for raw materials and experienced raw material cost increases during fiscal 2022 compared to prior fiscal years. These trends improved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and it is anticipated that these worldwide disruptions and supply issues will continue to improve in fiscal year 2023.
 
In addition, a few raw materials and purchased parts used in NTIC’s rust and corrosion inhibiting products and Natur-Tec® finished products are sourced from suppliers who currently serve as NTIC’s sole source of supply for these materials and parts.  Although NTIC believes it can obtain these raw materials and parts from other suppliers, an unexpected loss of supply over a short period of time, including as a result of the worldwide disruption in supply issues, may not allow NTIC time to replace these sources in the ordinary course of business.

Backlog
 
NTIC had an estimated order backlog of $5,856,655 as of August 31, 2022, compared to $4,192,000 as of August 31, 2021, which was generally across all business units. Sales relating to this backlog are expected to be realized during first quarter of fiscal 2023. These are orders that are held by NTIC pending release instructions from the customers to be used for just-in-time production. Customers generally place orders on an “as needed” basis and expect delivery within a relatively short period of time.
Governmental Regulation
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has indicated to NTIC that it has no objection to the use of ZERUST® ICT® packaging products in protecting metal food containers and processing equipment. In addition, the manufacture, sale and use of NTIC’s Natur-Tec® resin compounds and finished products are subject to regulation in the United States by the FDA. The FDA’s regulations are concerned with substances used in food packaging materials. Thus, food and beverage containers are in compliance with FDA regulations if the components used in the food and beverage containers are approved by the FDA as indirect food additives for their intended uses and comply with the applicable FDA indirect food additive regulations or are generally recognized as safe for their intended uses and are of suitable purity for those intended uses. NTIC believes that its resin compounds are in compliance with all FDA requirements and that NTIC does not require further FDA approval prior to the sale of its products.
