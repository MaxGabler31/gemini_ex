Item 1. Business 
Company Overview
 We, through our wholly owned subsidiary Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals Inc., are a pharmaceutical research and development (“R&D”) company that has developed and patented an innovative polymer delivery system, Invisicare® and formulated over forty topical skin products, which we out-license globally. We were incorporated in 1998, and target an estimated $80 billion global skincare and dermatology market and a $30 billion global over-the-counter market as well as other healthcare / medical and consumer goods markets.
 With the research and development complete on forty products and numerous patents issued (technology and product patents), we are ready to monetize our investment. Our business model will continue to be to out-license our patented prescription and over-the-counter (“OTC”) products featuring Invisicare to established manufacturers and marketers of brands internationally and to maximize profits from the products we have already out-licensed. We have also formed a commercial subsidiary, Kintari Int. Inc. with subsidiaries Kintari USA Inc. and Kintari Canada Inc., in order to take our cosmeceutical and select OTC products with Invisicare to market.
 The opportunity for us to license our products continues to be a viable model as the need for pharmaceutical companies to access external R&D companies for new products due to their own down-sizing or elimination of internal R&D departments. The demand for our products is enhanced due to the granting of key US and international patents and the completed development of a number of unique products.
 

On November 27, 2017, we announced that we had entered into a non-binding term sheet regarding a proposed merger of our company with and into Quoin Pharmaceuticals Limited (“Quoin”) subject to approvals, tax, accounting, legal, regulatory, and other considerations. Our proposed merger with Quoin Pharmaceuticals Inc., if consummated, will result in a new company focused on addressing major societal issues including the opioid epidemic and the military veteran suicide rate (PTSD). Our shareholders will own 27.5% of the new company and Quoin will own 72.5% post-merger. This division of ownership is prior to a private placement investment for clinical development and approximately 50% of Skinvisible’s debt conversion. The discussions continue.
 
Our Flagship Product
 
Pivotal to our success is our patented polymer delivery system technology Invisicare. Invisicare is a patented polymer delivery system that enhances the delivery of active ingredients for topically applied skin care products. Its patented technology has a unique formula and process for combining active ingredients with a delivery system that extends the duration of time the product remains on the skin and active.
 Invisicare is specifically formulated to carry water insoluble active and certain cationic active ingredients in water-based products without the use of alcohol, silicones, waxes, or other organic solvents. Products utilizing Invisicare have the proven ability to bond active ingredients to the skin for up to four hours and longer. They are non-occlusive and allow normal skin respiration and perspiration while moisturizing and protecting against exposure from a wide variety of environmental irritants.

When topically applied, these formulated products adhere to the skin's outer layers, forming a protective bond, resisting wash-off, and delivering targeted levels of therapeutic or cosmetic skincare agents to the skin. They allow enhanced delivery performance for a variety of skincare agents resulting in improved efficacy, longer duration of action, reduced irritation and lower dosage of active agent required. The "invisible" polymer compositions wear off as part of the natural exfoliation process of the skin's outer layer cells.
 
The advantage of products formulated with Invisicare is (1) Invisicare’s ability to bind active ingredients (the drug) to the skin, forming a protective bond on the skin, for extended periods of time - some up to eight hours or more; (2) Invisicare can deliver targeted levels (high or low) of therapeutic or cosmetic ingredients to the skin in a controlled release; (3) Invisicare can help to reduce the irritation of some active ingredients due to how it controls the slower release of that active ingredient; and (4) Invisicare science proves that it provides a protective skin barrier which helps retain the natural moisture content of the skin, while still allowing it to breathe. These benefits present an excellent opportunity for clear scientific advantages and marketing messages which resonate with physicians and consumers.
 
The Market
 
The dermatology market is large, with over 80% of Americans affected by some kind of skin condition in their lifetime. The worldwide market for dermatology products including prescription, OTC and cosmeceuticals is estimated at $80 billion.
Company History
 
We formed Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Skinvisible”), in March 1998 and purchased the exclusive worldwide manufacturing and marketing rights for a polymer delivery system invention now called Invisicare® from the inventor for $2 million. We have continued to develop the Invisicare technology and subsequent product development resulting in over seven series of Invisicare and over forty unique, patented formulations offering distinctive benefits that differentiate them significantly from other leading products in the marketplace.
What We Do
 
We have positioned ourselves in the $80 billion worldwide prescription and over-the-counter dermatology and skincare market. We generate revenue by:
 

DIRECT SALES: We develop topical over-the-counter products enhanced with Invisicare
to sell directly into the market through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Kintari Int. Inc. These products are also sold online at
www.Kintari.com as well as having the potential to be private labeled for companies outside of the USA and Canada;
LICENSING: We develop topical prescription and over-the-counter products enhanced
with Invisicare to license to pharmaceutical and consumer goods companies around the world for an upfront fee and ongoing royalties;
CO-DEVELOPMENT: We assist pharmaceutical clients in the early development of the
most optimal formulation, which they then take forward into clinical testing;
LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT: We provide cost-effective solutions to global pharmaceutical
companies by reformulating their products coming off patent with a new Invisicare patent and new product benefits and line extensions.
Pharmaceutical companies are under a lot of pressure to develop innovative strategies to counteract the revenue loss from their
drugs coming off patent.

Corporate Ownership
 
We are a publicly traded company under the symbol SKVI, quoted on the OTC markets since February 1999 and currently trading on the OTCQB in the United States.
 
We carry on business primarily through our wholly owned subsidiaries: Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals, Inc. a Nevada corporation, and Kintari Int. Inc., a Canadian corporation.

Patents
 
We have fourteen patents granted, including comprehensive patents on Invisicare, the foundation of all of our products; three in the United States, and internationally in Canada, Europe (4), China, India, Australia, Hong Kong, and Korea. The Invisicare patents cover manufacturing, composition and use. Additionally, we have been granted product specific patents in the United States for dermal barrier products, sunscreens (photostability of avobenzone) ,retinoids (stabilization), cationic products and acne products.
 
Our value lies in our ability to continually generate new IP on dermatology and medical products formulated with Invisicare. Patent approvals are sought (initially in the United States. and later internationally) for all products developed. All patents with Invisicare are owned by us.
 
Trademarks
 
When developing new products using Invisicare, we file for both patent and trademark protection. We have been granted trademarks in the U.S. and Canada for the following names:
 
- Skinvisible® w Invisicare® w JUSTCARE® w Work Gluv® w Bare Sunless Tanning® w Kintari® w Skinbrella®
 
Revenue generation: We receive a combination of five revenue streams including:
 

Sales of our cosmeceutical product line through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Kintari Int. Inc. Research and development fees; Upfront license fee; Ongoing royalties based on product sales; Licensees purchase Invisicare polymers from us. The polymers make up 6-8% of each final product formulation for OTC and cosmetic formulas and less for prescription formulas.

Kintari Int. Inc. was incorporated in the Province of Alberta, Canada. The company was formed to develop, market and sell Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s patented skincare products initially in the United States. Kintari Int. Inc. is our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
DermSafe®, our hand sanitizer formulated with Invisicare® and chlorhexidine gluconate has been launched in Canada by our subsidiary Kintari Canada Inc. where it has Health Canada approval. We launched DermSafe in August, 2016 in Canada through our Kintari Canadian website for retail customers only. DermSafe is an alcohol free hand sanitizer that products against 99% of all germs. We are currently seeking licensees and/or distributors to begin the sale of DermSafe in South America and in the EU.
 
Kintari Products in China:
 Skinvisible has an agreement in place with InterSpace Global, Inc. InterSpace Global Inc. is an exporter of “Made in USA” products and has offices in Salt Lake City, Utah and Shenzhen, China. This agreement provides for an efficient export of Skinvisible’s products from the USA and Canada into Greater China (Includes China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Korea and Thailand).
 According to the agreement, InterSpace Global Inc. will sell Kintari products to Chinese consumers through a network of online shopping malls and other channels.
 In addition to DermSafe, Skinvisible will supply its Kintari –branded portfolio of globally patented skincare products made with its Invisicare® delivery technology.
 The Kintari product portfolio consists of two anti-aging products to help fight the signs of aging, a broad spectrum sunscreen along with our latest Hand & Body Lotion products. All products are made with our patented Invisicare technology.
 Our anti-aging products have been developed using proven anti-aging ingredients with scientific evidence of their effectiveness at reducing the look of fine lines and wrinkles resulting in youthful looking skin. These potent ingredients will be powered by patented Invisicare technology, providing consumers with unique, effective products, which we believe cannot be duplicated.
 Our sunscreen is a broad spectrum SPF 30 known as Skinbrella®. We completed independent testing to validate our broad spectrum sunscreen claims according to the labeling guidelines of the FDA, which are designed to help reduce the incidents of skin cancer in the U.S. Our claims are as follows:
 

Claim # 1 – Broad-Spectrum: According to the FDA, in order for a sunscreen to be labeled
“broad spectrum” it must prove it protects against both UVA and UVB rays by having an SPF (Sun Protection Factor) of
at least 15 and a critical wave length of at least 370 nm. Our sunscreen has surpassed both of these criteria, allowing our broad
spectrum sunscreen label to also state “prevents sunburn, skin cancer and aging due to the sun.”

Claim # 2 – Water-Resistant 80 Minutes: The FDA sunscreen water resistant claim requires
that a sunscreen must have the same SPF after being in water or sweating for 40 or 80 minutes. Our testing was conducted at an
independent laboratory specializing in sunscreen testing. The test involved human subjects that applied sunscreen to their arm,
followed by the immersion of the arm into a Jacuzzi for 80 minutes (10 minutes in / 10 minutes out). Our sunscreen successfully
completed this testing and is allowed to use “Water-resistant for 80 Minutes” on its sunscreen label, the longest length
of time allowed by the FDA.


Claim # 3 – Unique Patented Technology / Eight-Hour Photostability: As previously
announced, we were granted a patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office entitled “Sunscreen Composition with
Enhanced UVA Absorber Stability and Methods”, which provides protection until November 2029. Skinvisible successfully formulated
a unique Invisicare® delivery system specifically for stabilizing avobenzone; the key sunscreen used in the USA. Data submitted
to the US patent office proved that our sunscreen provides a minimum of eight hours of photostability.


Our Hand & Body Lotion is formulated with five moisturizers including aloe, shea butter, glycerin, coconut oil and jojoba oil, and to help smooth your skin the powerful antioxidant Vitamin E. These ingredients restore and nourish your skin from head to toe.
 
Cannabis Products
 
On September 15, 2016, we licensed the exclusive world rights to our topical and transdermal cannabis products formulated with Invisicare to CannaSkin, LLC, a cannabis product licensing company with international contacts in the medical marijuana industry. This agreement was canceled on June 28, 2017 and all rights reverted back to Skinvisible.
 
In September 2017 Skinvisible formed a wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary called Ovation Science Inc. (“Ovation”). Ovation was subsequently granted worldwide rights to Invisicare products formulated with cannabis or hemp seed oil. A license agreement with Canopy Growth Inc. for the Canadian rights was also assigned to Ovation. This was followed by a license agreement with Lighthouse Strategies, LLC for the US rights in dispensaries and the non-exclusive rights outside of dispensaries in the USA. A term of the potential merger agreement with Quoin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. involves Skinvisible Related Parties to assume Skinvisible’s ownership in Ovation in lieu of payment of a portion of outstanding debt.
 
Capitalize On Current Licensees:
 
We have: Avon Products globally and Women’s Choice Pharmaceuticals in the United States.
 
We continue to work diligently with our licensees to ensure they have a smooth manufacturing process, ongoing R&D support and marketing feedback.
 
Avon Products, Inc.
 
Product: We have a long-term contract with Avon globally for over ten years to provide Invisicare polymer for their long-lasting lipsticks.
 
Sales: Invisicare polymers are purchased directly from Skinvisible.
 
Women’s Choice Pharmaceuticals
 
Product: ProCort®, long lasting prescription hemorrhoid cream launched in the United States August 2011.

Sales and Royalties: Skinvisible receives a royalty based on net sales of ProCort. Women’s Choice has been successfully growing their sales of ProCort®
 
Additional Skinvisible Products
 
Sunless Tanning Products
 
We have developed a sunless tanning mousse / foam which uses a unique foam with Invisicare®, developed specifically for its foaming properties. This adds to Skinvisible’s line of sunless tanning products which includes sunless tanning lotions (light, medium and dark), pre-sun moisturizer and after-sun moisturizer along with sunless tanning spray products for commercial use. The addition of a sunless tanning mousse enhances this line of products.
Sunscreen Products
 
We have developed 3 broad spectrum sunscreens, with SPF 15, 30 and 50 (the highest SPF allowed by the FDA). All are formulated with Avobenzone, the only UVA sun filter allowed under the US FDA monograph. This UVA/UVB sunscreen was granted a patent from the United States patent office in 2013. Avobenzone is known for breaking down in the sun after only two hours – thus the requirement to reapply every 2 hours. Skinvisible’s patent was granted based on Invisicare's® minimum 8 hour photo stability. For countries outside the United States, Skinvisible has additionally patented UVA/UVB sunscreens formulated with Tinosorb S.
Increasing The Value of Skinvisible’s Pipeline: 
 
We have a pipeline of over forty products which are available for licensing. Testing is conducted in-house generating proof of concept including release of the active ingredient as well as long term shelf life (stability). Additional studies conducted on specific products including skin sensitivity, toxicity and product efficacy are outsourced to FDA compliant laboratories. These studies are critical in attracting potential licensees. Our clinical strategy is to:

Our clinical strategy is to find a partner for our prescription product portfolio. This
would allow for a partner to seek FDA approval using the 505b2 pathway for one or more of our products.


Expand the availability of our DermSafe® hand sanitizer in China and other countries
internationally. A strategy is being developed along with a larger global strategy to bring DermSafe to the EU and Asia.

Secure Additional Licensees:
 We are in discussions and undergoing internal discussions with various pharmaceutical companies for licenses.
 To facilitate further expansion, we are seeking an exclusive license with a proven US or global based Pharmaceutical Company for our existing Rx product formulations. The licensee would be expected to pay all costs in getting FDA approval. The licensee would pay Skinvisible for the license in milestone payments as Clinical Phases are proven.
Competition
 
Market research indicates there is reasonably limited direct competition for Invisicare and patented products in terms of performance capabilities for topically administered skin products. Many companies are seeking unique delivery systems to enhance their portfolio and purchasing companies that have delivery technology.
 
Some of the companies involved in developing delivery technology are listed below. However, none of these competitors offer the same advantages of Invisicare principally the “long-term staying power” and the ability to control the release of active ingredients on the skin.

GSK through its subsidiary, Stiefel Laboratories Inc., purchased Connetics Corporation for
approximately $640 million in the fall of 2006. (Subsequently in 2009, Stiefel, with $900 million in sales, was purchased by GlaxoSmithKline
for $3.9 billion – at 4 times revenue). Connetics has a patented foam delivery technology.


Foamix Ltd is a drug development company with its head office in Israel. It has developed
five platforms which use a foam delivery technology and is used in products like Rogaine®.


A.P. Pharma sold its acne and actinic keratosis products made with its patented Microsponge®
delivery system to two companies for a reported $30 million; Johnson & Johnson purchased the Retin-A Micro® product line,
with revenues of $110 million in the US in 2006 and sanofi-aventis purchased Carac®, a product used to treat actinic keratosis,
with $11 million in sales in 2001.

Government Regulation
 
Cosmetic and Skin Care Regulation 
 
Depending upon product claims and formulation, skin care products may be regulated as cosmetics, drugs, devices, or combination cosmetics and drugs. We currently only market cosmetic skin care products and are evaluating entry into the pharmaceutical market. The FDA has authority to regulate cosmetics marketed in the United States under the FDCA and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (“FPLA”) and implementing regulations. The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) regulates the advertising of cosmetics under the FTCA.
 
The FDCA prohibits the marketing of adulterated and misbranded cosmetics. Cosmetic ingredients must also comply with the FDA’s ingredient, quality, and labeling requirements and the FTC’s requirements pertaining to truthful and non-misleading advertising. Cosmetic products and ingredients, with the exception of color additives, are not required to have FDA premarket approval. Manufacturers of cosmetics are also not required to register their establishments, file data on ingredients, or report cosmetic-related injuries to the FDA.
 
We will be responsible for substantiating the safety and product claims of the cosmetic products and ingredients before marketing. The FDA or FTC may disagree with our characterization of one or more of the skin care products as a cosmetic or the product claims. This could result in a variety of enforcement actions which could require the reformulation or relabeling of our products, the submission of information in support of the product claims or the safety and effectiveness of our products, or more punitive action, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If the FDA determines we have failed to comply with applicable requirements under the FDCA or FPLA, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions from public warning letters, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil penalties to seizure of our products, total or partial shutdown of our production, and criminal prosecutions. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us. If the FTC determines we have failed to substantiate our claims, it can pursue a variety of actions including disgorgement of profits, injunction from further violative conduct, and consent decrees.
 
Domestic State and Local Government Regulation 
 
Some states and local governments in the United States regulate the labeling, operation, sale, and distribution of our skin care products. To the extent additional state or local laws apply, we intend to comply with them.
Foreign Government Regulation 
 
In general, we will need to comply with the government regulations of each individual country in which our products are to be distributed and sold. These regulations vary in complexity and can be as stringent, and on occasion even more stringent, than FDA regulations in the United States. The level of complexity and stringency is not always precisely understood today for each country, creating greater uncertainty for the international regulatory process. Furthermore, government regulations can change with little to no notice and may result in up-regulation of our product(s), thereby creating a greater regulatory burden for us. We have not yet thoroughly explored the applicable laws and regulations that we will need to comply with in foreign jurisdictions. As a result it is possible that we may not be permitted to sell our products in foreign markets or expand our business into one or more foreign jurisdictions.
Environmental Laws
 
We are not subject to any significant or material environmental regulation in the normal operation of our business.
 
Employees
 
Currently, we have four employees, including our CEO Terry Howlett. All our employees with the exception of our bookkeeper are full-time employees.
 
Subsidiaries
 
We conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Skinvisible Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Kintari Int. Inc.
