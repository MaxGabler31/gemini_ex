ITEM 1. Business.
General
Hexcel Corporation and its subsidiaries (herein referred to as “Hexcel”, “the Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), is a global leader in advanced lightweight composites technology. We propel the future of flight, energy generation, transportation, and recreation through excellence in providing innovative high-performance material solutions that are lighter, stronger and tougher, helping to create a better world for us all. Our broad product range includes carbon fiber, specialty reinforcements, prepregs and other fiber-reinforced matrix materials, honeycomb, resins, engineered core and composite structures for use in commercial aerospace, space and defense, and industrial applications.
We serve international markets through manufacturing facilities, sales offices and representatives located in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, India, and Africa. We also have a presence in Malaysia where we are a partner in a joint venture which manufactures composite structures for Commercial Aerospace applications.
 We are a manufacturer of products within a single industry: Advanced Composites. We have two reportable segments: Composite Materials and Engineered Products. The Composite Materials segment is comprised of our carbon fiber, specialty reinforcements, resin systems, prepregs and other fiber-reinforced matrix materials, and honeycomb core product lines and pultruded profiles. The Engineered Products segment is comprised of lightweight high strength composite structures, RF/EMI and microwave absorbing materials, engineered core and specialty machined honeycomb products with added functionality and thermoplastic additive manufacturing.
 
Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, we have seen the impacts of COVID-19 on our markets and operations, including significant decreases in air traffic, temporary shutdowns of our customers’ and suppliers’ facilities and decreased demand from our customers. Our operations, margins and results have been adversely impacted by lower demand for our products due to substantial reductions in original equipment manufacturer build rates combined with a move to reduce inventory throughout our supply chain, particularly carbon fiber. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and may have further negative impacts on our operations, supply chain, transportation networks and customers, all of which may continue to compress our margins, even after the preventative and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments have taken and may take in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets globally and has contributed to volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for our products, services and raw materials, which could continue for an extended period of time.
In 2021, the Commercial Aerospace market began to see signs of recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including an increase in domestic air travel and the conclusion of supply chain inventory destocking. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to adversely impact our business, potentially diminishing the signs of recovery that began in 2021, depends on future developments, including availability of effective vaccines and medical treatments for all age groups and the rate of vaccinations and their effectiveness against new variants of COVID-19, as well as any other new information concerning the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain or mitigate the effects of COVID-19 and the emergence and impact of new variants of COVID-19. The uncertainty over the future economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 means the future financial impact to the Company cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
The following summaries describe the ongoing activities related to the Composite Materials and Engineered Products segments as of December 31, 2021.
Composite Materials
The Composite Materials segment manufactures and markets carbon fibers, fabrics, and specialty reinforcements, prepregs and other fiber-reinforced matrix materials, structural adhesives, honeycomb, molding compounds, tooling materials, polyurethane systems and laminates that are incorporated into many applications, including commercial and military aircraft, transportation (including automotive, marine and trains), wind turbine blades, recreational products, and other industrial applications.

The following table identifies the principal products and examples of the primary end-uses from the Composite Materials segment:


SEGMENT | PRODUCTS | PRIMARY END-USES 
COMPOSITE MATERIALS | Carbon Fibers |  Raw materials for prepregs, fabrics and specialty reinforcements Filament winding for various aerospace, defense and industrial applications 
 | Fabrics, Multi-axials and Specialty Reinforcements |  Raw materials for prepregs Composites and components used in aerospace, defense, wind energy, automotive, recreation, marine and other industrial applications

Carbon Fibers: HexTow® carbon fibers are manufactured for sale to third-party customers as well as for our own use in manufacturing certain reinforcements and composite materials. Carbon fibers are also woven into carbon fabrics, used as reinforcement in conjunction with a resin matrix to produce pre-impregnated composite materials (referred to as “prepregs”). Carbon fiber is also used in filament winding to produce finished composite components. Key product applications include structural components for commercial and military aircraft and rotorcraft, space launch vehicles, and certain other applications such as recreational and industrial equipment.
 Fabrics, Multi-axials and Specialty Reinforcements: HexForce® fabrics, multi-axials and specialty reinforcements are made from a variety of fibers, including carbon, glass, aramid and other high strength polymers, quartz, ceramic and other specialty fibers. These reinforcements are used in the production of prepregs and other matrix materials for aerospace and select industrial markets including wind energy blades, automotive components, oil exploration and production equipment, boats, surfboards, skis and other sporting goods equipment.
Prepregs: HexPly® prepregs are manufactured for sale to third-party customers and for internal use by our Engineered Products segment in manufacturing composite laminates and monolithic structures. Prepregs are used in primary and secondary structural aerospace applications such as wing components, horizontal and vertical stabilizer components, fairings, radomes, engine fan blades and cases, engine nacelles as well as overhead storage bins and other interior components. They are also used in many of the industrial and recreational products noted above.  Prepregs are manufactured by combining high-performance reinforcement fabrics or unidirectional fibers with a resin matrix to form a composite material that, when cured, has exceptional structural properties not present in either of the constituent materials individually. Prepregs are applied via hand layup, automatic tape layup and advanced fiber placement to produce finished composite components. Prepreg reinforcements include glass, carbon, aramid, quartz, ceramic and other specialty fibers. Resin matrices include bismaleimide, cyanate ester, epoxy, phenolic, polyimide and other specialty resins.

Other Fiber-Reinforced Matrix Materials: Fiber reinforced matrix developments include HexTool®, a specialized form of quasi-isotropic carbon fiber prepreg for use in the cost-effective construction of high temperature resistant composite tooling. HexFIT® film infusion material is a product that combines resin films and dry fiber reinforcements to save lay-up time in production and enables the manufacture of large contoured composite structures, such as wind turbine blades.
Resins: HexFlow® polymer matrix materials are sold in liquid and film form for use in direct process manufacturing of composite parts. Resins can be combined with fiber reinforcements in manufacturing processes such as resin transfer molding, resin film infusion or vacuum assisted resin transfer molding to produce high quality composite components for both aerospace and industrial applications, without the need for customer investment in autoclaves.
Structural Adhesives: We manufacture and market a comprehensive range of HexBond® film and paste adhesives. These structural adhesives, which bond metal to metal and composites and honeycomb structures, are used in the aerospace industry and for many industrial applications.
Honeycomb: HexWeb® honeycomb is a lightweight, cellular structure generally composed of a sheet of nested hexagonal cells. It can also be manufactured in over-expanded and asymmetric cell configurations to meet special design requirements such as contours or complex curvatures. Honeycomb is primarily used as a lightweight core material and acts as a highly efficient energy absorber. When sandwiched between composite or metallic facing skins, honeycomb significantly increases the stiffness of the structure, while adding very little weight.
We produce honeycomb from a number of metallic and non-metallic materials. Most metallic honeycomb is made from aluminum and is available in a selection of alloys, cell sizes and dimensions. Non-metallic materials used in the manufacture of honeycomb include fiberglass, carbon fiber, thermoplastics, non-flammable aramid papers, aramid fiber and other specialty materials.
We sell honeycomb as standard blocks and in slices cut from a block. Aerospace is the largest market for honeycomb products.
 Our HexWeb® Acousti-Cap® sound attenuating honeycomb provides dramatic noise reduction during takeoff and landing without a structural weight penalty, Acousti-Cap® incorporates a non-metallic, permeable cap material that is embedded into honeycomb core. In addition, we produce honeycomb for our Engineered Products segment for use in manufacturing finished parts for airframe original equipment manufacturers.
Polyspeed® Pultruded Profiles: Hexcel manufactures a wide range of pultruded sections including rods, flat sections, tubes and specific profiles that are usually made from carbon fiber but can also be made from glass, quartz, basalt or other fibers. The profile matrix is a Hexcel formulation of thermoset resin (epoxy or polyurethane). Hexcel pultruded profiles are used in a wide range of industrial applications.

Net sales for the Composite Materials segment to third-party customers were $1,019.4 million in 2021, $1,185.9 million in 2020, and $1,863.1 million in 2019, which represented about 80% of our net sales each year. Net sales for composite materials are highly dependent upon the number of commercial aircraft produced as further discussed under the captions “Significant Customers.” “Markets” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Engineered Products
The Engineered Products segment manufactures and markets composite structures and precision machined honeycomb parts primarily for use in the aerospace industry. Composite structures are manufactured from a variety of composite and other materials, including prepregs, honeycomb, and structural adhesives, using such manufacturing processes as autoclave processing, multi-axis numerically controlled machining, heat forming, infusion and other composite manufacturing techniques. Composite structures include HexAM® 3D printed parts, which offer significant weight cost and time-to-market reductions compared to incumbent metal or traditional composite technologies. This segment also provides advanced interference control materials, structural composites, and services; dielectric absorber foams and honeycomb; magnetic absorbers; and thermoplastics for commercial and defense applications.
 The following tables identify the principal products and examples of the primary end-uses from the Engineered Products segment:
   
SEGMENT | PRODUCTS | PRIMARY END-USES 
ENGINEERED PRODUCTS | Composite Structures |  Aircraft structures and finished aircraft components, including wing to body fairings, wing panels, flight deck panels, door liners, rotorcraft blades, spars and tip caps 
 | Engineered Honeycomb |  Aircraft structural sub-components and semi-finished components used in rotorcraft blades, engine nacelles, and aircraft surfaces (flaps, wings, elevators and fairings) 
 | RF Interference Control |  Military and aerospace applications 

 
Net sales for the Engineered Products segment to third-party customers were $305.3 million in 2021, $316.5 million in 2020, and $492.6 million in 2019, which represented approximately 20% of our net sales each year.
The Engineered Products segment includes a 50% ownership interest in a Malaysian joint venture, Aerospace Composites Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (“ACM”) with Boeing Worldwide Operations Limited. Hexcel historically purchased certain semi-finished composite components from the joint venture and performed inspection and additional assembly work prior to direct delivery to Boeing production lines. As part of Boeing's supply chain optimization, this assembly work has been transferred overseas in stages in 2020 and 2021 to other parts of the Boeing supply chain, including ACM. Effective January 1, 2022, all of this work was transferred and Hexcel no longer purchases semi-finished components from ACM. Under the ACM joint venture structure, 50% of ACM net income continues to accrue to Hexcel. ACM had revenue of $30 million in 2021, and $24 million and $61 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Significant Customers
 Approximately 33%, 33% and 39% of our 2021, 2020 and 2019 net sales, respectively, were to Airbus and its subcontractors. Of the 33% of overall sales to Airbus and its subcontractors in 2021, 29% related to Commercial Aerospace market applications and 4% related to Space & Defense market applications. Approximately 16%, 19% and 25% of our 2021, 2020 and 2019 net sales, respectively, were to Boeing and its subcontractors. Of the 16% of overall sales to Boeing and its subcontractors in 2021, 12% related to Commercial Aerospace market applications and 4% related to Space & Defense market applications.
Markets
Our products are sold for a broad range of end-uses where durability, strength and weight are important factors to our customers. We sell to three different markets: Commercial Aerospace, Space & Defense and Industrial.
 Commercial Aerospace
The Commercial Aerospace industry is our largest user of advanced composites. Commercial Aerospace represented 50% of our 2021 net sales. Approximately 82% of these revenues can be identified as sales to Airbus, Boeing, and their subcontractors for the production of commercial aircraft. Approximately 18% of these revenues were for business jets, regional and other commercial aircraft. The economic benefits airlines obtain from weight savings in both fuel economy and aircraft range, combined with the design enhancement that comes from the advantages of advanced composites over traditional materials, has resulted in the aerospace industry becoming the leader in the adoption and use of these materials. While military aircraft and spacecraft have led the development and adoption of these materials, Commercial Aerospace has greater production volumes and has commercialized the use of these products. Accordingly, the demand for advanced composites structural material products is closely correlated to the demand for new commercial aircraft.
The use of advanced composites in Commercial Aerospace is primarily in the manufacture of new commercial aircraft. These composite materials are designed to last the life of the aircraft and engine so as a result, the aftermarket for these products is minimal. The demand for new commercial aircraft is driven by two principal factors, the first of which is airline passenger traffic (the number of revenue passenger miles flown by the airlines) which affects the required size of airline fleets. Growth in passenger traffic requires growth in the size of the fleet of commercial aircraft operated by airlines worldwide.
A second factor, which is less sensitive to the general economy, is the replacement rates for existing aircraft. The rates of retirement of passenger and freight aircraft, resulting mainly from obsolescence, are determined in part by the regulatory requirements established by various civil aviation authorities worldwide as well as public concern regarding aircraft age, safety, noise, and emissions. These rates may also be affected by the desire of the various airlines to improve operating costs with higher payloads and more fuel-efficient aircraft (which in turn is influenced by the price of fuel) and by reducing maintenance expense. In addition, pressure is increasing on airlines to replace their aging fleet with more fuel efficient and quieter aircraft to be more environmentally responsible. For example, aircraft operators subject to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) are facing significantly higher costs to purchase carbon credits for compliance compared to the cost a few years ago, which may influence fleet replacement plans to purchase lightweight new aircraft. Additionally, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) emission reduction mandates for international aviation become mandatory later this decade, which may influence fleet renewal in the coming years. When aircraft are retired from commercial airline fleets, they may be converted to cargo freight aircraft, used for parts, or scrapped.

An additional factor that may cause airlines to defer or cancel orders is their ability to obtain financing, including leasing, for new aircraft orders. This will be dependent both upon the financial health of the airline operators, as well as the overall availability of financing in the marketplace.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, aircraft manufacturers significantly reduced production rates during 2020 as demand for new aircraft decreased significantly. Select aircraft production rates began to modestly increase in 2021 but remain well below the pre-pandemic peak production rates of 2019. Additionally, the parked fleet of commercial aircraft reached record levels globally in April 2020 as passenger traffic fell and airlines reduced capacity. Since this time, aircraft continue to return to service but the parked fleet remains elevated due to the continuing impact on air travel from the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Each new generation of commercial aircraft has used increasing quantities of advanced composites, replacing metals and other materials. This follows the trend previously witnessed in military applications where composites now comprise the majority of the airframe of latest generation aircraft to enhance performance, range and payload, including the F-35 Lightning and the CH-53K heavy lift transport helicopter. Early versions of commercial jet aircraft, such as the Boeing 707, which was developed in the early 1950’s, contained almost no composite materials. One of the first commercial aircraft to use a meaningful amount of composite materials, the Boeing 767 entered into service in 1983, and contains approximately 6% composite materials, primarily comprised of interior secondary composite structures. Boeing’s legacy 777 aircraft, which entered service in 1995, is approximately 11% composite including composite flaps/ailerons and landing gear doors. The Airbus A380, which was first delivered in 2007, has approximately 23% composite content by weight as the tail structure was built of composites. The Boeing 777X was redesigned with composite wings and a new composite-rich engine and is more than 30% composites. Boeing’s B787, which entered into service in 2011, has a content of more than 50% composite materials by weight including composite wings and fuselage. The Airbus A350 XWB (“A350”) which has a composite content of 53% by weight was first delivered in December 2014.
Engines and nacelles are also an attractive market for both Hexcel Composite Materials and Engineered Products, including composite fan blades, cowlings, and the nacelle. Both Airbus and Boeing introduced new versions of their narrow body aircraft which utilize composite-rich engines and nacelles, but continue to incorporate metal wings and fuselages that were designed decades ago. Airbus’s A320neo had its first customer delivery in 2016 and Boeing’s B737 MAX entered into service in 2017. The LEAP engines and nacelles on both the A320neo and B737 MAX are composite-rich as is the GE9X engine on the Boeing 777X.
 It is expected that future aircraft platforms will offer more opportunities for composite materials than their predecessors, as the Commercial Aerospace industry continues to utilize a greater proportion of advanced composite materials with each new generation of aircraft and each new generation of engines and nacelles. We refer to this steady expansion of the use of composites in aircraft as the “secular penetration of composites” as it potentially increases our average sales per airplane over time.
The impact on Hexcel of Airbus and Boeing production rate changes is typically influenced by two factors: the mix of aircraft produced and the inventory supply chain effects of increases or reductions in aircraft production. We have products on all Airbus and Boeing planes. The shipset or dollar value of our materials varies by aircraft type and aircraft platform. Newer designed aircraft use more of our materials than older generations, and as a materials provider, larger aircraft use more composites by weight than smaller aircraft. On average, for established programs, we deliver products into the supply chain about six months prior to aircraft delivery, with a range between one and eighteen months depending on the product and specific aircraft platform. For aircraft that are in the development or ramp-up stage we will have sales as much as several years in advance of delivery.

Airbus and Boeing combined backlog at December 31, 2021 was 12,216 aircraft, or a 0.3% increase compared to December 31, 2020. The production rates in 2021 remained low due to the impact of COVID-19 on air travel, low production rates of the Boeing 737 MAX following the aircraft's grounding that was only lifted in select regions by the end of 2020 and low production rates of the Boeing 787 following a temporary cessation of deliveries that was implemented during the second half of 2021. The balance of our Commercial Aerospace sales is related to regional and business aircraft manufacture, and other commercial aircraft applications. These applications also exhibit increasing utilization of composite materials with each new generation of aircraft.
Space & Defense
The Space & Defense market has historically been an innovator in the use of, and source of significant demand for, advanced composites. The aggregate demand by Space & Defense customers is primarily a function of procurement of military aircraft that utilize advanced composites, primarily by the United States and certain European governments, including both commercial and military rotorcraft. We are qualified to supply materials to a broad range of military aircraft, commercial helicopter and space programs, including the Lockheed Martin F-35 (Lightning), Bell-Boeing V-22 (Osprey) tilt rotor aircraft, UH-60 Black Hawk and Airbus A400M military transport. The F-35, which is our largest program, represents less than 25% of revenues in this market. No other program accounts for more than 10% of our revenues in this market. The sales from these programs are dependent upon those that are funded and the extent of the funding. Space applications for advanced composites include solid rocket booster cases, fairings

and payload doors for both government funded and commercial launch vehicles, and satellite buss and solar arrays for military and commercial satellites.
Another growth generating trend for Hexcel is the further penetration of composites in rotorcraft blades, including both new and replacement blades. The UH-60 wide chord blade program and blades for the V-22 were the two largest blade programs in 2021. CH-53K is a future growth program, including the composite helicopter blades and new helicopter programs in development which use Hexcel composites in prototypes. The blades include Composite Materials products such as carbon fiber, prepregs, and honeycomb core to improve blade performance. In addition, our Engineered Products segment provides specialty value added services such as machining, sub-assembly, and even full blade manufacturing for rotorcraft.
 The Space & Defense market represented 33% of our 2021 net sales. While our Space & Defense market has been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact has been significantly less than the impact to our Commercial Aerospace market. As a result, our Space & Defense sales comprised a greater percentage of our 2021 net sales than Space & Defense sales have historically comprised prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the five fiscal years prior to the start of the pandemic, including 2015 through 2019, Space & Defense sales comprised between 16% and 19% of total net sales. When the Commercial Aerospace market recovers to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, we would expect Space & Defense sales to return to a range generally consistent with historical pre-pandemic percentages.
 Industrial
The Industrial market represented 17% of our 2021 net sales. The revenue from this market includes wind turbine blades, automotive, a wide variety of recreational products, consumer electronics, marine and other industrial applications. A number of these applications represent emerging opportunities for our products. In developing new applications, we seek those opportunities where advanced composites technology offers significant benefits to the end user, often applications that demand high engineering performance. This includes carbon fiber and resin formulations that we produce as well as glass fiber we purchase from third parties that we then combine with our resin and weaving expertise. Within the Industrial market, wind energy has historically comprised the largest submarket with Vestas Wind Systems A/S (“Vestas”) as our primary customer. Demand in our wind energy sub-market declined in 2021 due in part to the commoditization and outsourcing of blades with a change in technology from prepreg using glass fiber that we purchased from third parties to infusion. The Industrial market also includes sales to major end user sub-markets, in order of size based on our 2021 sales: general industrial applications (including those sold through distributors), transportation (e.g., automobiles, mass transit and high-speed rail, and marine applications) and recreational equipment (e.g., skis and snowboards, bicycles and hockey sticks). Our participation in Industrial applications complements our commercial and military aerospace businesses, and in many instances, technology or products now used in aerospace were started in Industrial. We are committed to pursuing the utilization of advanced structural material technology and introducing new innovations to support our customers in response to changing market dynamics in Industrial markets where it can generate significant value and we can maintain a sustainable competitive advantage.
Further discussion of our markets, including certain risks, uncertainties, and other factors with respect to “forward-looking statements” about those markets, is contained under the captions “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Forward Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors”.
Backlog
In recent years, our customers have demanded shorter order lead times and “just-in-time” delivery performance. While we have many multi-year contracts with our major aerospace customers and our largest Industrial customer, most of these contracts specify the proportion of the customers’ requirements that will be supplied by us and the terms under which the sales will occur, not the specific quantities to be procured or the specific dates for delivery. Our Industrial customers have always desired to order their requirements on as short a lead-time as possible. As a result, twelve-month order backlog is not a meaningful trend indicator for us.
Raw Materials and Production Activities
Our manufacturing operations are in many cases vertically integrated. One example of the benefits of our vertical integration is that it enables us to control both the carbon fiber surface structure and resin formulations to optimize their interaction and ensure excellent interfacial adhesion or bonding. We produce and internally use carbon fibers, industrial fabrics, composite materials, and composite structures as well as sell these materials to third-party customers for their use in the manufacture of their products.
We manufacture high performance carbon fiber from polyacrylonitrile precursor (“PAN”). The primary raw material for PAN is acrylonitrile. All of the PAN we produce is for internal carbon fiber production. We utilized between 55% and 60% by value of the carbon fiber we produced in 2021 and between 60% and 65% in 2020, with the remainder of our output sold to third-party customers.

However, as one of the world’s largest consumers of high-performance carbon fiber, we also purchase significant quantities of carbon fiber from external sources for our own use. The sources of carbon fiber we can use in any product or application are generally dictated by customer qualifications or certifications. Otherwise, we select a carbon fiber based on performance, price, and availability. With the increasing demand for carbon fiber, particularly in aerospace applications, in recent years we increased our PAN and carbon fiber capacity to serve the growing needs of our customers and our own downstream products. After a new production line starts operating, it can take up to a year to be certified for aerospace applications. However, these lines can start supplying carbon fiber for many industrial applications within a shorter time period.
We formulate a variety of resin systems that are tailored to specific applications and support the process for manufacturing composite parts. The type of epoxy and curative used in the resin systems vary depending on the application being considered, including the required service temperature, mechanical performance, and rate of cure. We continually focus on innovation that will help our customers reduce their cycle time and increase their production through put, including lower curing temperatures, faster curing times, and enhancing the flow characteristics of the resin formulations, particularly for infusion manufacturing processes.
 We purchase glass yarn for our aerospace and industrial markets from a number of suppliers in the United States, Europe and Asia. We also purchase aramid and high strength fibers which are produced by only a few companies, and during periods of high demand, can be in short supply. In addition, epoxy and other specialty resins, aramid paper and aluminum specialty foils are used in the manufacture of composite products. A number of these products have only one or two sources qualified for use, so an interruption in their supply could disrupt our ability to meet our customer requirements. When entering into multi-year contracts with aerospace customers, we attempt to get back-to-back commitments from key raw material suppliers. While we are not dependent on any one supplier for the majority of our raw materials, we are highly dependent on our suppliers in order to meet commitments to our customers. During 2021, as a result of the challenges created by global transportation issues, the COVID-19 pandemic and market volatility, we experienced minor supply disruptions and anticipate that supply disruptions and material shortages may continue. We continue to work with our key suppliers who have been impacted by these supply disruptions to ensure that we are able to meet our customer commitments. While we have not experienced materially significant issues in the purchase of key raw materials, we continue to monitor the availability (including transportation) and price of raw materials on a regular basis, as well as any potential impact on our operations.
 Our manufacturing activities are primarily based on “make-to-order”, or “demand pull” based on customer schedules, and to a lesser extent, “make-to-forecast” production requirements. We coordinate closely with key suppliers in an effort to avoid raw material shortages and excess inventories. However, many of the key raw materials we consume are available from relatively few sources, and in many cases the cost of product qualification makes it impractical to develop multiple sources of supply. The lack of availability of these materials could under certain circumstances have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.
Research and Technology; Patents and Know-How
Our Research and Technology (“R&T”) centers of excellence located globally support our businesses worldwide. Through R&T activities, we maintain expertise in precursor and carbon fiber, chemical and polymer formulation and curatives, fabric forming and textile architectures, advanced composite structures, process engineering, application development, analysis and testing of composite materials, computational design, and other scientific disciplines related to our worldwide business base.
Our products rely primarily on our expertise in materials science, textiles, process engineering and polymer chemistry. Consistent with market demand, we have been placing more emphasis on higher performing products and cost-effective production processes while seeking continually to improve the consistency of our products and our capital efficiency. Towards this end, we have entered formal and informal alliances, as well as licensing and teaming arrangements, with several customers, suppliers, external agencies, and laboratories. We believe that we possess unique capabilities to design, develop, manufacture, and qualify composite materials and structures, including trade secrets and extensive internal knowledge gained from decades of experience. It is our policy to actively enforce our proprietary rights. We believe that the patents and know-how rights currently owned or licensed by Hexcel are adequate for the conduct of our business. We do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any single patent or series of related patents, or by the termination of any single license agreement or series of related license agreements.
Environmental Matters
We view climate-change as an important social issue that presents some level of risk to our business while also creating opportunities for greater composite adoption. Our strategic and operational decision making is influenced by our commitment to reduce the environmental impact of our operations, including our carbon footprint, air and water emissions and waste reduction. We continue to improve our emissions profile through operational efficiency improvements that lessen our use of fossil fuels and by increasing our use of renewable power. We have implemented sustainable energy sourcing within certain of our operations, with

recent solar projects at our manufacturing sites in Neumarkt, Austria, Casa Grande, Arizona, and Casablanca, Morocco. The generation of solar power reduces our demand for fossil-fuel powered electricity, which supports our carbon and greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. We have applied this same approach to our product life cycle, implementing circular economic principles to reduce waste – both in our manufacturing and product packaging. At this time, we are not subject to carbon emission trading programs at any of our facilities, though we are actively monitoring country and region-specific regulations and trends to ensure pricing and capital expenditures are incorporated into our future product portfolio planning.
 
The increasing global emphasis on emissions reduction is a trend that is supportive of our advanced composite light weighting solutions for transportation applications. We also market composite solutions that reduce aircraft engine noise, which benefits local communities near airports, supports aircraft operators in geographies that are subject to local noise abatement programs, and enables more direct routes for aircraft that saves fuel rather than having to fly longer routes to avoid noise-sensitive areas.
 We are subject to various U.S. and international federal, state, and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. We are also potentially subject to liabilities arising under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”), the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and similar state local and international laws and regulations that impose responsibility for the control, remediation and abatement of air, water and soil pollutants and the manufacturing, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and waste. We believe that our policies, practices, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and associated financial liability. To date, environmental control regulations have not had a significant adverse effect on our overall operations.
    A discussion of environmental matters is contained in Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” and in Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other Regulatory Matters
 As a materials supplier for U.S. prime contractors, we are subject to certain U.S. government Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement, and associated procurement regulations. As a result of our acquisition of ARC Technologies LLC in 2019, we have expanded our portfolio of U.S. government contracts and thereby increased our federal legal and regulatory compliance obligations. Specifically, we must comply with certain laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts, including the government security requirements and additional government export control laws and regulations. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may be required to make additional capital expenditures and incur other costs. Furthermore, failure to comply may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages, civil penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions, or suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government.
 As a company with significant international operations, we are also subject to numerous laws and regulations, including U.S. export controls and sanctions laws, customs regulations, international treaties and local trade rules around the world. These laws, rules and regulations may impose significant costs of compliance on the Company and may impact our competitiveness through restricting our ability to do business in certain places or with certain entities and individuals. The consequences of any failure to comply with trade regulations could limit our ability to conduct business internationally.
 Sales and Marketing
A staff of salaried marketing managers, product managers and sales personnel, sell and market our products directly to customers worldwide. We also use independent authorized distributors for certain products, markets, and regions. In addition, we operate various sales representation offices globally.
Competition
In the production and sale of advanced composites, we compete with a number of U.S. and international companies on a worldwide basis. The broad markets for composites are highly competitive, and we have focused on both specific sub-markets and specialty products within markets. In addition to competing directly with companies offering similar products, we compete with producers of substitutes for composites such as metal, structural foam, and wood. Depending upon the material and markets, relevant competitive factors include technology, product performance, historical database of usage, delivery, service, price, customer preference for sole sourcing and customer preferred processes.

We believe that new competitors face significant barriers to entry into many of our markets. These barriers include the intellectual property and unique skills and expertise to design and manufacture carbon fiber and to formulate resin systems for aerospace applications, an extensive database of qualification and performance measurements of our products, the advantages of scale derived

from significant global manufacturing capacity for aerospace-grade carbon fiber, and long-term customer relationships developed over decades of designing, manufacturing and working closely with our customers on composite applications. Further, the aerospace industry has rigorous product certification requirements and quality programs including one hundred percent traceability of all raw material and finished goods, and high expectations for consistent on-time delivery, which all act as barriers to entry.
 Human Capital
We believe our success depends on the skills, experience, and industry knowledge of our key talent. As such, our management team places significant focus and attention on the attraction, development, and retention of employees, as well as ensuring our corporate culture reflects Hexcel’s values, and our board of directors provides oversight for various employee initiatives. Our Hexcel values guide our actions, reflect our culture, and drive our performance, as explained in our Code of Business Conduct posted on our website at www.hexcel.com. We have made and continue to make significant investments in training and professional development, and we have well-established performance management and talent development processes that encourage employees to aspire to different career opportunities and for our managers to provide regular feedback and coaching to develop employees.
 The health and safety of our employees is also a top priority. Over the past ten years, our focus on the reduction of injuries and illnesses has significantly improved our safety performance. We have attained these improvements by fostering a global safety culture supported with regular training and education that includes robust systems and philosophies centered on personal responsibility and accountability. There is a high-level of leadership engagement, ensuring appropriate safety equipment is installed and operational at all of our manufacturing sites worldwide combined with vigorous reviews of root causation and systemic corrective actions of any safety incidents that may occur.
 In response to the emergence of COVID-19 in early 2020, we implemented a proactive internal procedure and complied with local, federal and international governmental guidance that has enabled us to maintain a safe and healthy environment for our employees and site visitors. Our internal procedure has evolved with the pandemic as a risk-based approach and varies by facility and region, allowing for adjustment based on local transmission rates and worker vulnerability. The procedures range from temperature screening and pre-entry questionnaires to masking to disciplined distancing and workzone isolation procedures. There are also robust contact tracing programs in place, with strict adherence to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for COVID-19 isolation and quarantine.
An engaged, innovative, skilled, and collaborative workforce is critical to our continued leadership in the advanced composites industry. We operate globally under policies and programs that provide competitive wages, benefits, and terms of employment. We are committed to efforts to increase diversity and foster an inclusive work environment that supports our global workforce through recruiting efforts, equitable compensation policies, and educational workshops to promote a positive and collaborative culture. Our diversity recruitment efforts include targeted university recruitment and attendance at conferences promoting racial and gender diversity in engineering, which have historically been a major source of candidates for our summer internship program and Early Career Program for new hires.
 Employee levels are managed to align with business demand and management believes it currently has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. As of December 31, 2021, we employed 4,863 full-time employees and contract workers: 2,611 in the United States and 2,252 in other countries. We employ a minimal number of contract workers. Approximately 30% of employees in the United States and the majority of those in Europe are represented by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with employees, unions and works’ councils are good. The total number of full-time employees and contract workers as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 4,647 and 6,977, respectively.
