Marketing Program
 
The primary objective of our marketing program is providing property management and maintenance, rehabilitation as well as construction equipment rental. We plan to accomplish our business objectives through a multi-faceted marketing program consisting of the following elements:

• | Face to face meetings and calls;
--+---------------------------------


• | Advertising;
--+-------------


• | Links to web source: http://arendasklad.biz 
--+---------------------------------------------

 
We have designed our public relations program to gain more customers, increase visibility, and heighten awareness of us and our services and capabilities. We will use regional business press to carry out our public relations program. The goals of our public relations program are:
 

• | Clearly establish us as a provider of property management and rental equipment services; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Differentiate us and our services from competitors; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Create a greater awareness with potential clients and partners; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Identify us as strong, trusted, and progressive through our partnerships and services. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Industry Background 
 
The property management service in Ukraine develops and grows. We believe the market for our property management and, as well as our construction equipment rental initially consists of small individual building owners who lack the time or proficiency to manage their own properties in a profitable manner or adequately repair damaged properties. Kharkov, along with Kiev, Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa and multiple other cities offer pockets of dense population and areas where we believe building owners will benefit from our services.
Advertising
 
Our advertising campaigns will generally focus on web, presentations, meetings, calls and leads. We have identified these forms of advertising as being the most effective means for reaching potential clients in our target markets. We also use the website www.arendasklad.biz as a means of advertising and as an electronic brochure for generating sales leads and increasing market awareness. We do not manage the properties pictured on our web site, which are examples of the types of properties we expect to manage in the future and are provided for marketing purposes. We will also consider other means of advertising.
 
We are implementing procedures to control advertising and promotions. These procedures are necessary to assure our proper representation and include review of all advertising material and restrictions on how our clients and others can advertise using our brand.
 
Business Strategy
 
We intend to provide property management, maintenance, rehabilitation to meet our clients’ needs. Our strategy is to leverage broad geographic reach, long-term client relationships, and full-range and service offerings to become a large, robust property management firm. We have adopted a multi-step growth plan:

-


• | Offering property management services for both commercial and residential spaces. The infrastructure across Ukraine is being adversely impacted by the conflict with neighboring Russia, thus requiring high quality, cost efficient solutions to make such properties usable again. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Offering construction equipment rental for those properties that already have their own maintenance teams but don’t own their own equipment outright. The inventory of equipment that we will hold for rental will also be available for use with our property rehabilitation and property management services. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are first offering our services in Kharkov, and plan to expand our reach on a city-by-city basis, expanding geographically to meet the demand for property management and as well as property rehabilitation and construction equipment rental. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We seek to be a ‘one-stop shop’ for the building owners. Additionally, for those building owners who either cannot afford a full-time property manager, or have so few properties that they prefer to manage themselves, we offer property management and rehabilitation services to help those building owners make the most of their time and extract the most value from their property.

Pricing
 
Costs associated with the customer acquisition, retention, overhead and management and continued servicing are budgeted individually for each project. Contingencies are allowed for as deemed necessary. Then our pricing will be reviewed based on competitors’ prices, along with a market survey of the satisfaction with these prices and the associated services. We are of the opinion that the pricing of our services will represent a savings to the customer and yet provide us a better-than-market sales price.
Sales Objectives
 
We are introducing our services to the marketplace, which we believe will benefit us because of the opportunities that are presented due to the current political and military situation in Ukraine. Our sales strategy looks to convert sales in the following ways, depending on the perceived needs of individual building owners:
 
Sales Process 1: Construction equipment rental
 
Sales Process 2: Upsell to property rehabilitation
 
Sales Process 3: Property rehabilitation
 
Sales Process 4: Post rehabilitation property management
 
Sales Process 5: Post rehabilitation property management consulting
 
Sales Process 6: Property management
 
Sales Process 7: Property management consulting
 
Sales Process 8: Upsell to property rehabilitation or construction equipment rental.
 
Also, we intend to introduce our products and services for existing and new clients to capture revenue streams from new clients as well as utilizing existing relationships, and obtain new revenues as the market matures. We believe our path to revenue and growth will be through acquiring clients:

• | from organizations with which our management has existing relationships; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | from competitors by demonstrating superior, quality, and reliability at a lower cost; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | by implementation of our marketing plan. 
--+---------------------------------------------

 
The foregoing does not include all of the ways we expect to convert leads to sales.
 
Strategic Partners and Alliances
 
We expect to leverage sales and delivery alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own, either by enhancing our services, or by helping extend offerings to new geographies. By combining alliance partners’ products and services with our capabilities and expertise, we intend to create innovative, high-value business solutions for our clients. Some alliances will be specifically aligned with our offerings, thereby adding skills, technology and insights that are applicable across the real estate and construction industries. Currently, we do not have any strategic partners or alliances.

Governmental Regulation
 
Laws and regulations impose environmental zoning restrictions, use controls, disclosure obligations, and other restrictions that affect the management, development, use, and/or sale of real estate. Such laws and regulations tend to discourage sales and leasing activities. Transactions in which we are involved may be delayed or abandoned as a result of these restrictions.
 
In Ukraine, legislation is not good developed that governs a foreign entity conducting business within the country. Even though we are headquartered and operate in Ukraine, the laws applicable to us as a Nevada USA corporation include requirements that (a) we take out liability insurance on behalf of any full-time employees and (b) we maintain adequate books and records and periodic financial statements. We are also subject to various consumer protection laws that prohibit the use of fraudulent or deceptive practices.
 
Competition
 
The property management, property rehabilitation and construction equipment rental businesses are competitive and have relatively low barriers to entry. We compete locally, and expect to eventually compete on a countrywide basis, with a variety of primarily local companies that offer similar services. Based on our review of advertisements, we believe the majority of these companies engage in real estate sales and offer property management services, but not property rehabilitation construction equipment rental and some are affiliated with the owners or operators of properties where they provide their services. Many of our competitors have had many more years of business experience, may have proprietary processes and have greater financial and personnel resources including marketing and sales organizations, and may provide their services at lower rates. We do not believe any one company holds a dominant share of the local or countrywide market on which we are focused.
Employees
 
 Mr. Guzii is our only employee at the date of this registration statement. We do not have an employment agreement with Mr. Guzii. He devoted his time and efforts as needed when operations and funding are available. We anticipate hiring additional employees in a future on a commission basis only. We will hire necessary personnel based as needed only on a per contract basis to be compensated directly from revenues. Mr. Guzii will work on a fulltime basis once we have enough revenue to sustain his full-time employment. At the present time, he is spending whatever time is necessary, to further develop our business.
