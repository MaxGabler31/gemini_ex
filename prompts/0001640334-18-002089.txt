On January 10, 2018, our company, Analog Nest Technologies, Inc. (“Analog Nest”) and the shareholders of Analog (the “Analog Nest Shareholders”) closed a transaction pursuant to a share exchange agreement dated January 10, 2018, whereby our company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Analog Nest (the “Analog Nest Stock”) from the Analog Nest Shareholders. In exchange for the Analog Nest Stock our company issued 100,000 shares of our common stock to the Analog Nest Shareholders.

Product Lines
 
Analog Nest operates primarily in the computer/software applications industry and specifically in the development of Android and iOS apps for mobile devices. In the past five years the number of total apps on the Google Play Store has increased from around 200,000 in 2011 to around 1.6 million in 2015 and currently about 2 million apps in the Apple’s App store as well. The Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store are generally referred to herein as an “App Store”.
 
Analog Nest generates revenue from selling certain apps in the App Stores and from displaying advertisements in certain applications. Approximately eighty percent (80%) of Analog Nest revenue is generated from the sales of Apps and the remaining revenue comes for advertising.
 
Market Opportunity
 
With the mobile market still booming, there are billions of mobile devices for which we can offer Apps. Given this large number of available devices, even the smallest App ideas have the potential to generate millions of downloads for its developer.
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that the Apps have a solid reputation in the App Stores - some Apps are within the top 1,000 of their categories in the US and also top 10,000 out of all apps on the Google Play Store. We believe that our Apps are for most part unique with solid source codes. Many of the other apps on the market are copycat apps, as opposed to a majority of Analog Nest Apps which are original and unique in their region. We attempt to distinguish the Apps by providing prompt customer services.
Customers and Marketing
 
Analog Nest has an aggregate of approximately nine million downloads of its Apps from users around the globe, with the US taking the majority of that share. 
 
So far no specific marketing for our Apps has been done. Due to the high ranking and ratings of the Apps, the optimized app store app descriptions, the user's acquisition is done either directly through play store search or via deep linking from within the other Apps in the portfolio. Having a large portfolio of Apps helps drive more downloads, since each App can serve ads for the other Apps on the portfolio.
 
With the introduction of Google’s Universal app campaigns a new marketing opportunity has been given to the app vendors to better target audiences through the Google Ad network in an efficient and cost effective way.
 
Using Google’s Universal app campaigns, the goal is to target 1 million new installs or downloads in the next 12 months. To achieve this number of installs a marketing budget of at least $100,000 USD will be required to generate a lot of installs on a cost per install (CPI) basis.
 
Competition
 
The app industry is highly competitive, with low barriers to entry and we expect more companies to enter the sector and a wider range of apps to be introduced. In addition, we have limited experience in developing apps for mobile and other platforms and our ability to succeed on those platforms is uncertain. As we continue to devote resources to developing apps for those platforms, we will face significant competition from established companies and new-comers.
Regulatory Matters
 
Google and Apple are responsible for regulating their respective app stores. Their stringent rules and guidelines make it so that app developers are mostly shielded from government regulatory bodies as each app goes through a manual approval process before being published on the store. If Google or Apple believe that such app could be in breach of any laws, they simply do not approve it.

Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding consumer protection, intellectual property, export and national security, that are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws outside the United States. For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted or the content provided by users.
Employees
 
Other than our directors and officers, who provide their services to our company and independent consultants, we have no full time employees.
