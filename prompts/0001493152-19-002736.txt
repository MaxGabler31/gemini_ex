ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Corporate History and Structure
 
Avant Diagnostics, Inc. (“Avant”, “we” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) was incorporated on October 16, 2008 in the State of Nevada as “Oreon Rental Corporation”. At the time of its incorporation, the management of the Company intended to operate electronics rental stores in Ternopil and other similar cities throughout Ukraine. However, at the time of its incorporation and its initial public offering of common stock in October 2008, the Company did not own any such stores, nor did it have any ongoing business operations. The Company underwent a change in management in January 2010. Following the change in management, the Company decided not to proceed with its original plan of operations and to shift its business focus to that of an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition, drilling and production of oil and natural gas properties and prospects. During 2014, the Company wound down its oil and natural gas operations and decided to complete a reverse recapitalization with Avant Diagnostics, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (“Avant-NV”) established in 2009. Avant-NV was originally named Arrayit Diagnostics, Inc. which was formed as a majority owned subsidiary of Arrayit Corporation (“Arrayit”) through a technology transfer in July 2009. In January 2013, the Company effected a name change to Avant Diagnostics, Inc.

Acquisition of Avant Diagnostics, Inc.
 
Effective December 29, 2014, Avant Diagnostics, Inc. completed a reverse recapitalization, as agreed in the definitive Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, of 100% of the outstanding equity interests of the Company. Avant stockholders received 74,354,139 shares of common stock for a 93% equity interest in the Company. Such share exchange was calculated based on a one-for-one conversion ratio after a 1 for 17 reverse stock split of the Company which was subsequently effected in March 2015. The split affected the Company’s common stock and not the common stock of Avant Diagnostics, Inc. All references in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to the number of shares, options and other common stock equivalents, price per share and weighted-average number of shares outstanding of common stock have been adjusted to retroactively reflect the effect of the reverse stock split. Per the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, the Company was delivered with zero assets and $70,000 in liabilities at time of closing. Following the reverse merger, we changed the name of the Company to “Avant Diagnostics, Inc.” The transaction was regarded as a reverse recapitalization whereby Avant Diagnostics Inc. was considered to be the accounting acquirer as it retained control of the Company after the exchange. Although the Company is the legal parent company, the share exchange was treated as a recapitalization of the Company. Avant Diagnostics, Inc. is the continuing entity for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations reflected in the financial statements are those of Avant Diagnostics, Inc. for all periods presented.
 
As of September 30, 2018, there remained a total of 3,510,000 shares of common stock that still had not been converted by Avant Diagnostics, Inc. stockholders as part of the reverse recapitalization. The Agreement and Plan of Reorganization does not provide for cash in lieu of exchange of shares and provides that upon the merger, the stockholders acquired their rights in the Company’s common shares and all outstanding shares of Avant Diagnostics, Inc. were deemed to be cancelled. There is no timeframe as to when the stockholders must convert their shares and, as of the date of this report, the shares have not been issued.
 
Business Model
 
The Company is a commercial-stage molecular data-generating company that focuses on the development and commercialization of a series of proprietary data-generating assays that provide important actionable information for physicians and patients, as well as biopharmas, in the areas of oncology. The Company’s near-term goal is to commercialize the technology originally developed by Theranostics Health, Inc. (“Theranostics” or “THI”), a company whose assets Avant acquired in May 2016. These products differentiate themselves by:

● | Exclusive license agreement with George Mason University (“GMU”), that has well-published scientists in our area of expertise; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Having access to the Ph.D.’s at GMU who have done pioneering work in phosphoproteomic-based biomarkers diagnostics; 
● | Domain expertise in cancer biomarker and data-generating laboratory testing data; 
● | Development of proprietary, cutting edge assays focused on precision oncology care; 
● | Building revenue streams based on our proprietary technology TheraLink®. 
● | Having a patent portfolio licensed from GMU and the NIH. 

 
Avant is advancing proprietary technology in the field of phosphoproteomic research, a sector which has emerged as one of the most exciting new components in the high-growth field of precision molecular diagnostics. The TheraLink® platform makes it possible to generate an accurate and comprehensive portrait of protein pathway activation in diseased cells from each patient, and thereby determine which individuals may be better responders to certain targeted molecular therapies. The platform enables the quantitative measurement of the level of activation. Moreover, the sensitivity is many times greater than conventional mass spectrometry and other protein immunoassays. Initially spun-out of GMU in 2006, and subsequently brought to the federal government’s Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (“CMS”) Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) standards, the diagnostics suite is highly relevant for oncology patient management today by improving (i) chemotherapy drug selection; (ii) immunotherapy drug selection; and (iii) optimization of combination therapy selection.
 
The biomarker and data-generating tests provide biopharmas, clinical scientists and physicians with molecular-based guidance as to which patients will benefit from the new, molecular targeted therapeutics being developed and used to treat various life-threatening oncology diseases, as well as existing treatment standards that are recognized as the standard of care in the oncology treatment community. This addresses the core aspect of precision treatment today – identifying which individuals are more likely to respond to specific targeted molecular therapies, thus forming the basis for personalized medicine.

The technology is based upon the pioneering work of three noted scientists, Drs. Lance Liotta, Emanuel Petricoin and Virginia Espina in proteomic-based diagnostics. Avant benefits from a portfolio of intellectual property derived from licensing agreements with:
 

● | The US Public Health Service (“PHS”), the federal agency that supervises the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), which provides the Company with broad protection around its technology platform; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | George Mason University (“GMU”) which provides access to additional intellectual property around improvements to the technology platform and biomarker signatures that form the basis for future diagnostic products. 

 
Avant is committed to advancing the technology from GMU and the NIH as a platform for the development of new clinical biomarkers and diagnostics. These diagnostic and monitoring products have the potential to provide biopharmas and doctors with critical molecular-based knowledge to make the best therapeutic decisions based on a patient’s unique, individual medical needs.
 
Milestones
 
The Company intends to focus on key milestones planned to be executed upon in the next 12 months, driving value for both investors and the healthcare industry alike. These milestones include:

● | Moving the laboratory equipment to Golden, Colorado; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Completing the leasehold improvements and setting up all laboratory equipment to CLIA and College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) standards; 
● | Hiring a Medical Director, Pathologist, Lab Director, Assistant Lab Director, Research Scientist, Q/A Consultant, Biostatistical Consultant, Histotech, CFO, two Business Development consultants and an Office Manager; 
● | Begin the formation of a Medical and Scientific Advisory Board; 
● | Establishing a CAP/CLIA lab, in coordination with GMU scientists, that accesses tumor samples and other medical specimens, such as hair follicles, that provide the basis to drive revenue channels; 
● | Continuing to validate the TheraLink® cancer biomarker technology under CAP/CLIA standards to provide personalized medicine regarding treatment options for biopharmas, clinical oncologists and their cancer patients; 
● | Complete partnerships with pharma companies to perform oncology-related data-generating testing services to create revenue; and 
● | Begin revenue generation from pharma companies. 

 
THERALINK® Technology
 
Market Overview
 
Avant’s TheraLink® technology focuses on the oncology discipline of molecular pathology. Within oncology, Avant intends to initially focus on breast cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer.
 
Within the clinical diagnostics space, Avant aims to be a leading companion diagnostics provider by delivering assays that are intended to assist physicians when making pharmaceutical treatment decisions for a given patient.
 
For therapy selection, companion diagnostics results are intended to elucidate the efficacy of a specific drug or drug class for specific cohorts of patients within which a given patient is placed. Companion diagnostic’s companies are of particular interest to both drug development companies as well as physicians. The former benefit because the results of companion diagnostic assays improve a drug development’s accuracy in selecting patients who are most likely to benefit. The latter benefit because they can improve their decision-making information on matching the specific patient with what is likely to be the most effective drug for that patient. The basis of the effectiveness of companion diagnostic assays is built upon surrogate biomarkers, which are intended to measure an effect of a specific pharmaceutical treatment and its correlation to a biomarker, or endpoint. To aid in therapy selection, Avant believes the most effective method is by taking a phosphoproteomic approach to tumor analysis.

Asset Description & Intellectual Property
 
Background
 
Theranostics was a privately held company founded in 2006. Its core technologies were focused on the quantitative measurement of proteins comprising key signaling pathways in disease and include pre-analytical processing of preclinical and clinical samples, Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), and Reverse Phase Protein Microarray (RPMA). The application of the technology enables TheraLink® to work with both freshly frozen and formalin-preserved research and clinical samples.

LCM is used to isolate specific cell populations from the many different types of cells usually present in a clinical biopsy tissue sample. Therefore, information derived from subsequent molecular assays is specific to that targeted cell population. RPMA enables sensitive, quantitative, calibrated, multiplexed analysis of cellular proteins from a limited amount of starting materials, such as clinical specimens. Theranostics Health had an exclusive license from the National Institute of Health (NIH) to commercialize LCM isolation of cells with proteomic analysis for cancer diagnostics and companion diagnostics of which Avant now is the licensee.
 
Patent Portfolio
 
We own or have exclusively licensed 8 granted U.S. patents, 7 foreign patents and no pending U.S. patent applications. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application.
 
The patent positions of companies such as ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of method of use patents or reformulation patents has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States are also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and enforce the patent rights that we license, and also could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use, or the manufacture of those products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and the issued patents that we in-license and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents that we own or exclusively in-license. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing, and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.

GMU License Agreement
 
Our exclusive license agreement with GMU (1) Grants an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under the Licensed Inventions to make, have made, import, use, market, offer for sale and sell products designed, manufactured, used and/or marketed for all fields and for all uses, subject to the exclusions discussed below, (2) Grants an exclusive option to license to past, existing, or future inventions in the field of TheraLink®, from inventors that are obligated to assign to GMU and who have signed a memorandum of understanding acknowledging that developed intellectual property will be offered, subject to the exclusions discussed below (3) The license and option granted specifically excludes biomarkers for lung, ovarian, and breast cancers in a diagnostic field of use and GMU inventions developed using materials obtained from third parties under agreements granting rights to inventions made using said materials and (4) Grants right to assign or otherwise transfer license so long as such assignment or transfer is accompanied by a change of control transaction and GMU is given 14 days prior notice. In addition, the Company is required to make an annual payment of $50,000 to GMU as well as pay GMU (i) a quarterly royalty equal to the net revenue multiplied by one and one-half percent (1.5%), due on a quarterly basis or (i) a quarterly sublicense royalty equal to the net revenue multiplied by fifteen percent (15%). In addition, Avant has the right of first refusal for all technology associated with RPPA technology from GMU.
NIH License Agreement
 
Our license agreement with NIH grants an exclusive United States license. In addition, the Company is required to make an annual payment of $6,000 to NIH as well as pay NIH a royalty equal to the net sales multiplied by three percent (3.0%) every June 30th and December 31st of the year. In addition, a sublicense royalty equal to the net revenue multiplied by ten percent (10%) will be payable upon sublicensing.
 
Regulatory Approvals – CAP/CLIA and FDA
 
Upon commencement of laboratory operations, the Company can transact with certain counterparties such as biopharmaceutical companies for the processing of data-generating services for research use only (RUO). These counterparties will be the initial clients and source of initial service revenues.
 
Upon attainment of the CAP/CLIA and other certifications for the laboratory, the Company can expand its data-generating services from our single lab to address a broader range of clients. Specifically, either as a direct provider of diagnostic services to hospitals and chronic care providers for precision health screening by oncologists, or indirectly as a reference laboratory, thereby increasing potential diagnostic services revenues. The oncologists would eventually be using our data-generating services to optimize potential treatment protocols for breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer patients. The Company estimates that it will attain such certification by late 2019, after which time it will ramp-up related marketing and sales efforts.
 
The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) are federal regulations for United States based clinical laboratories to provide industry standards for testing of human samples for diagnostic purposes. These amendments were added to the laboratory requirements outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations, 42 CFR 493. Three federal agencies are responsible for ensuring compliance of laboratories to CLIA: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Center for Disease Control (CDC).
 
Further, a laboratory can pursue a higher level of quality by becoming accredited by a recognized accreditation agency. The College of American Pathologists (CAP) is such an agency. The CAP releases its own requirements building upon CLIA ‘88 regulations. Compliance is assessed by a peer group site inspection every two years. Meeting these criteria ensures that industry specific standards for laboratory operation are upheld in the lab. These requirements can also point out areas for improvement in order to reach the highest level of quality.
 
Subsequently if Avant receives FDA approval, the Company can further expand its data-generating services with the opening of additional laboratory sites to include, for example, oncologists using precision therapy selection in hospitals and chronic care provider groups. These oncologists would be using the data-generating services to optimize potential treatment protocols for breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer patients once the TheraLink® assays are fully developed for these applications.
 
The attainment and timing of key regulatory approvals are critical and precedent requirements to the related commencement of marketing and subsequent realization of revenues. The Company has provided estimates above which are subject to change based on a variety of factors, including subsequent changes in regulations and the timing and cost for the Company to attain the requirements and receive approval(s) as required.

Goals for 2019 & Beyond
 

● | Goal to attain FDA, other regulatory approvals for breast cancer in 2021-2022; commence mass marketing; finalize international partnerships and start to open Canada, Asia, Europe and Israel; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Explore and pursue FDA, other regulatory approvals for other indications in 2022-2023; 
● | Increase mass marketing and market share in all approved jurisdictions, 2022 & 2023. 

Commercialization Strategy
 
TheraLink® is a micro-volume multi-marker tumor analysis platform that has been developed to improve upon the limitations of current techniques (such as western blot, immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and next generation sequencing (NGS)) that produce low resolution information with modest gains in predictive power on which to base treatment plans. TheraLink® significantly improves decision-making for the biopharma, the oncologist and the patient because it recommends therapeutic options that are optimized for a patient’s specific tumor. The TheraLink® proprietary micro-volume protein expression platform can potentially improve the management of over 800,000 cancer patients in the US alone based on figures provided by the American Cancer Society. It is anticipated that TheraLink® will be brought to CAP/CLIA standards for breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer in the future, and eventually for most cancers, including possibly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
 
TheraLink® works along the entire continuum of drug development – from discovery, to pre-clinical through to drug commercialization.
 
Research Use Only segment
 
For RUO, its target customers fall into two main groups – those requiring discovery and early stage drug development, and those requiring later stage drug development.
 

A. | For customers in the early stage drug development, TheraLink® provides target identification and validation, model system validation (cells, xenografts), and optimization of compounds in specific absorption rate (SAR) studies. Because TheraLink® is able to directly measure the drug target, this allows customers to make smarter decisions regarding the efficacy of their drug, and whether to move forward or not, thus allowing them to reduce cost. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
TheraLink®’s advantages over its potential competitors on the pre-clinical side include:
 

● | Ability to measure multiple endpoints simultaneously (over 300) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Flexibility in choice of endpoints (post-translational modifications) 
● | Ability to process different samples (cells, CSF, tissues, etc.) 
● | Sensitivity: nL sample, representing <2,000 cells 
● | Robust assay, reproducible, sensitivity, and specificity 
● | Calibration across experiments, direct comparison 


B. | For customers requiring later stage drug development, TheraLink® identifies markers for the customers to use in clinical validation, identifies pathway/marker sets with potential utility in clinical setting, validates selected efficacy markers in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials, identifies markers for patient stratification, and validates markers for future companion diagnostics. The value that TheraLink® provides these clients is to identify the appropriate individuals for the customer’s drug trials, i.e., those individuals that have the relevant activated pathways that make them most likely to be responsive to the drug. This will allow the customers to potentially reduce the size of their Phase III trials, allowing for a substantial cost and time savings.

TheraLink®’s advantages over its potential competitors on the clinical side include:
 

● | First in class profiling activated proteins in signaling pathways 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | One stop shop: from sample handling to LCM to data generation and final report 
● | Sensitivity allows use of small clinical biopsy (less than 30,000 cells). 
● | LCM allows purification of relevant cell populations 
● | Focus directly on relevant drug targets (marketed molecular therapeutics) and potential drug targets (those in development) 
● | Specific pathway signatures with focus on relevant nodes 
● | Advantage for combination therapy, high specificity on targeted pathway, monitor compensatory pathways, and activation through feedback signal 

 
CAP/CLIA certified laboratory segment
 
Sample processing is via a single certified laboratory. Strategically, the data-generating services can be delivered at two distinct channels and are not mutually exclusive (i.e. can execute at one or both levels). The “direct sales” channel typically refers to marketing, sales and execution of sample processing and specific diagnostic services to the end-user as the hospital and chronic care provider for precision health screening by oncologists. The “reference laboratory” channel typically refers to providing a subcontract service to one or more counterparties (who have CAP/CLIA certification) - so we are not direct to the end-user in this channel.
 
FDA approved laboratory segment
 
Sample processing will be through one or more certified laboratories that the Company manages. Again, there is the “direct sales” channel (same as above). In addition, there is the “companion diagnostic” aspect to the end-user as the hospital and chronic care provider for precision health screening by oncologists that is specifically related to a drug’s indication and efficacy for the patient’s specific cancer biomarkers. Avant’s involvement with biopharmas in various stages of drug development and RUO is related to the success of companion diagnostic marketing.
 
Our initial objective is to capitalize on the successful pilots with biopharmaceutical companies and leading medical schools in the clinical trial environment, by preparing TheraLink® for commercial launch by September 30, 2019. The aim is to gain rapid adoption as a differentiated technology in the personalized healthcare marketplace by leveraging the strong support of the many key opinion leaders and users of the pilot platform.
 
TheraLink® will be our flagship product for our commercial strategy focused on a precision health screening for oncologists. The assay to be launched to the market has been previously validated in a CAP/CLIA certified laboratory, and will be ready once re-validated.
 
The key ingredients to our commercial success will be:
 

1) | A proprietary technology that provides a credible point of entry to a well-defined medical market; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | A previous potential pipeline of commercial partners that believe in the viability of our technology; 
3) | Comprehensive protocols for cancer biomarkers positioned for seamless integration to established standards of care for oncologist treatment regimens; 
4) | Eventually a data friendly format and HIPPA compliance for ease of integration to monitoring systems and artificial intelligence (AI) modalities for oncologist teams to track precision diagnostics and monitor patient treatment outcomes.

A. Proprietary Technology for credible commercial point of entry
 
Avant’s focused technologies are of particular value to oncologist teams developing molecular targeted and/or combination therapies because of our ability to make very small and precise measurements in the cellular microenvironment. The platforms are based on assessing protein activation status (via post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, methylation, cleavage, etc.) of drug targets and receptors, their downstream signal transduction pathways, and potential compensatory or adaptive mechanisms within targeted cell populations. These commercial collaborations are critically important as they establish our company’s platform as a “must have” in specific cancers (e.g., breast cancer management), where precise and targeted chemotherapy, and immunotherapies can make a dramatic difference in patient outcomes. It is planned that we intend to be collaborating with top industry and medical school oncology experts, and key opinion leaders (KOL’s), who are focused on developing precision oncology therapeutics.
 
B. Strong pipeline of potential commercial partners
 
Avant intends to deliver a comprehensive precision cancer biomarker platform by seamlessly integrating its technology into the workflow of oncologists in various healthcare networked systems. Currently, the oncology precision tumor analysis market is dominated by genomic diagnostic companies such as Genomic Health and Foundation Medicine. Avant’s technologies provide a unique, complementary and actionable knowledge base to existing market players, seeking to improve the practice of medicine for oncologists and their patients. Our targeted commercial partners are seeking offerings that help differentiate their approach to oncology care, by using patient-centric solutions to enable better chronic patient management during and after treatment to maximize patient outcome and prevent recurrence. Avant sees this as a major commercial opportunity to serve both hospitals and primary care providers in the US who also have reach to cancer treatment programs abroad (i.e. Europe and Asia).
 
Avant is poised to solve that problem by establishing relationships with hospital/chronic care providers. Our approach to commercial partners with awareness of TheraLink®’s features and benefits and who are ready for deployment may yield a substantial amount of oncology treatment cases.
 
In the ultimate design and execution of its future commercialization strategy, the Company will seek to optimize accessible opportunities for the realization of revenue and the value of our IP. The details of the actual commercialization strategy are likely to vary from the range, combination and timing discussed above; and such variations may not produce the anticipated results.
 
Operations during the year ended September 30, 2018
 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, the Company curtailed its operations as a result of its limited operating capital. Since the end of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 through September 30, 2018, we have focused on executing our business plan by commercializing our proprietary data-generating technology in the area of oncology, as well as focusing on the relocation and opening of a revenue producing CAP/CLIA laboratory. The Company is focused on improving revenues in the pharma services business by acquiring customers with oncology-focused preclinical and clinical drug development programs. The Company is establishing business relationships with pharmaceutical companies in early and late stage clinical development.
 
In connection with the purchase of the business assets and certain liabilities of Theranostics, the Company acquired a CLIA laboratory located in Gaithersburg, Maryland. THI was a leading developer of proteomic technologies for measuring the activation status of key signaling pathways that are instrumental in the development of companion diagnostics for molecular-targeted therapies. THI has used these proteomic technologies to support the drug development programs of many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology drug development companies. THI was also providing these testing capabilities to clinical oncologists to advance personalized medicine through its TheraLink® data-generating assays.
 
As a result of the cost cutting measures taken during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, the Company substantially curtailed the use of the CLIA laboratory. As a result of these cost cutting measures, the Company was unable to timely make certain payments on the terms of the lease. As a result, the Company defaulted on its lease at the location of the Maryland laboratory and the landlord held the equipment located in the facility as collateral for amounts owed under the lease. AVDX Investors Group, LLC (“AVDX”), an entity controlled by Jeff Busch, our Executive Chairman (“Busch”), loaned the Company the capital to purchase the equipment. The note issued to AVDX is a demand promissory note that bears no interest and is secured by the equipment. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, AVDX, Busch and his affiliated entities also loaned and/or paid certain obligations amounts on behalf of the Company.

----


Once the Company reacquired the equipment for the laboratory, management undertook a review of the Company’s current operations and decided to move the CLIA laboratory from Maryland to Golden, Colorado (the “New Lab”) In connection with the relocation to the New Lab, the Company executed a lease, built out the space for the New Lab and moved the equipment from Maryland to Colorado. In connection with this relocation, management, in consultation with scientists from George Mason University, the licensor of the Company’s Theralink® technology (“Licensor”), evaluated the status of the Company’s equipment. It was determined that the equipment was not properly maintained and was left in poor working order by prior management. As a result, the Company had to spend approximately $152,209 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 to have the equipment refurbished for the New Lab, so the Licensor could assist management with the set up and validation of the equipment to be used for the technology. The Company continues to build out the lab and plans to have it operational during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.
 
Marketing and Pricing
 
The Company had derived its revenues from patients and from biopharma research and development contracts. These contracts required the Company to provide services directed towards specific objectives and include developmental milestones and deliverables. Up-front payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when milestones are achieved. The Company had been reimbursed for certain costs incurred in performing the specific research and development activities and recorded the reimbursement as revenues.
Market Opportunity
 
According to a study conducted by Quest Diagnostics, the largest clinical testing laboratory in the U.S., the laboratory testing market in the United States is approximately $50 billion market that is 60% controlled by testing performed by hospital-based laboratories. The remaining portion of this market is divided between independent clinical laboratories (35%) and physician office laboratories (POLs) that perform 5% of overall testing. Within the independent clinical laboratory segment, Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp are the two largest national reference labs and control approximately $12.5 billion of this $17.5 billion market segment. The remaining $5 billion is controlled by other national laboratories and smaller independent regional laboratories. Within this $50 billion market, most of the testing that is performed is for routine lab tests and anatomic pathology tests and services. However, recently there has been a dramatic increase in gene-based and esoteric testing. Esoteric tests include procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics, protein chemistry, cellular immunology, and advanced microbiology. Commonly ordered esoteric tests include viral and bacterial detection tests, drug therapy monitoring tests, autoimmune panels, and complex cancer evaluations.
 
The growth of these specialized tests has been made possible through new molecular diagnostic technologies that make it possible to detect diseases earlier, utilize genetic testing for disease predisposition, and advance the use of personalized medicine, such as the tailoring of cancer therapies to those individuals most likely to respond. Esoteric tests typically require highly-skilled technical personnel and generally require more sophisticated technology, equipment or materials. As a result, esoteric tests are generally reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests. This increase in specialized testing is evidenced by the shift in Quest Diagnostics’ esoteric testing revenues from less than 10% of total revenues to their current level of 20% over the past 9 years. In the case of LabCorp, the second largest clinical testing laboratory in the country, in 2009 esoteric testing accounted for 36% of their annual consolidated revenue, which they expected to grow to 40% within three to five years. In addition to Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, there are approximately 60 commercial laboratories that control the independent clinical laboratory market segment in the United States. There are also approximately 300 genetic testing laboratories in the U.S., with 80% of them affiliated with academic institutions. As a result of these new trends, molecular diagnostic testing that supports personalized medicine is now the fastest growing segment within the overall laboratory testing market.

There are a number of key trends that are having a significant impact on the clinical testing business and represent opportunities for companies that can develop novel diagnostic tests. Clinical laboratory testing is an essential healthcare service and is being favorably impacted by the following:
 

● | Demographics: The growing and aging population is increasing the demand for clinical testing; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increased testing: Physicians are increasingly relying on diagnostic testing to help identify disease risk, detect the symptoms of disease earlier, aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen, and monitor patient compliance and to evaluate treatment results; 
● | Advances in science and technology: Recent medical advances have allowed earlier diagnosis and treatment of diseases and continuing research and development in the area of genomics is expected to yield new, more sophisticated and specialized diagnostic tests. These advances also are spurring interest in, and demand for, personalized or tailored medicine; 
● | Prevention and wellness: There is an increased awareness of the benefits of preventative medicine and wellness. Consumers, employers, health plans, and government agencies are increasingly focusing on detecting diseases earlier and providing preventative care that helps avoid disease. 

 
As a result of these significant changes in the laboratory testing and IVD markets, it is evident that there is a significant commercial opportunity for companies that provide products or services that address the new needs of the evolving diagnostics marketplace. This is the market opportunity that the Company is addressing through its introduction of data-generating assays that use patented, patent-pending, and proprietary technology to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection, prevention, and treatment.
 
Our Strategy
 
The Company’s solution is to utilize the technology that it has exclusively licensed from GMU and the NIH to exploit the new opportunities that are evolving in the diagnostics industry, both for biopharmas and for oncologists and their patients. The Company was created to specifically commercialize reverse phase protein array (RPPA) assays and services that are focused on determining the right drug, for the right patient, at the right time. These novel data-generating technologies are based on patented and proprietary technology that is well-suited to be run in a central or regional laboratory utilizing samples that are collected by healthcare providers and sent to the authorized CAP/CLIA-certified testing facility for processing. This approach is similar to the business model that Foundation Medicine has utilized (which was recently purchased by Roche for $5.3 billion) with its genomic assays. However, whereas Foundation Medicine provides a genomic assay that is only 5% actionable by the oncologist, the Company will market data-generating assays that can be over 70% actionable by oncologists and will be used to determine which FDA-approved or investigational drug is most efficacious in which cancer. To achieve this goal of commercializing new data-generating opportunities, the Company is leveraging off the strategic relationships that have been established with organizations such as George Mason University and others to develop unique and high value-added data-generating assays.
Governmental Regulation
 
The services that we provide are regulated by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Failure to comply with the applicable laws and regulations can subject us to repayment of amounts previously paid to us, significant civil and criminal penalties, loss of licensure, certification, or accreditation, or exclusion from government health care programs. The significant areas of regulation are summarized below.
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation
 
Our clinical laboratory must hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. Laboratories in the United States that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease are subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or (“CLIA”). CLIA requires such laboratories to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure that testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. CLIA certification also is a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal health care programs, as well as many private insurers, for laboratory testing services. We plan on applying for CLIA certification once our lab is operational.

In addition, CLIA requires certified laboratories to enroll in an approved proficiency testing program if it performs testing in any category for which proficiency testing is required. Our laboratory will periodically test specimens received from an outside proficiency testing organization and then submit the results back to that organization for evaluation. If our laboratory would fail to achieve a passing score on a proficiency test, it could lose its right to perform testing. Further, failure to comply with other proficiency testing regulations, such as the prohibition on referral of a proficiency testing specimen to another laboratory for analysis, can result in revocation of our laboratories’ CLIA certification.
 
As a condition of CLIA certification, our laboratory is subject to survey and inspection every other year, in addition to being subject to additional random inspections. The biennial survey is conducted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), a CMS agent (typically a state agency), or a CMS-approved accreditation organization. Our laboratory will also apply for accreditation by the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”), which is a CMS-approved accreditation organization.
 
CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law. Our laboratory will be licensed by the appropriate state agency in Colorado, if such licensure is required. If a laboratory is out of compliance with state laws or regulations governing licensed laboratories, penalties for violation vary from state to state but may include suspension, limitation, revocation or annulment of the license, assessment of financial penalties or fines, or imprisonment. We believe that we will be in material compliance with all applicable licensing laws and regulations when we become operational.
 
Food and Drug Administration
 
Although the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has consistently claimed that it has the authority to regulate laboratory-developed tests (“LDTs”) that are developed, validated and performed only by a CLIA certified laboratory, it has historically exercised enforcement discretion by not otherwise regulating most LDTs. Nevertheless, the FDA recently indicated that it is promulgating draft guidance for FDA regulation of most LDTs in the future.
 
After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
 

● | compliance with the QSR, which require manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, record maintenance, including maintenance of complaint and related investigation files, and other quality assurance controls during the manufacturing process; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and 
● | medical device reporting obligations, which require that manufacturers investigate and report to the FDA adverse events, including deaths, or serious injuries that may have been or were caused by a medical device and malfunctions in the device that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. 

 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions, including but not limited to, warning letters; fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of the device; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new devices; withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals; and civil or criminal prosecution. To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre-scheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA.

HIPAA and other privacy laws
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), established comprehensive federal protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations: health plans, healthcare clearing houses, and healthcare providers which conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically (“Covered Entities”). Title II of HIPAA, the Administrative Simplification Act, contains provisions that address the privacy of health data, the security of health data, the standardization of identifying numbers used in the healthcare system and the standardization of certain healthcare transactions. The privacy regulations protect medical records and other protected health information by limiting their use and release, giving patients the right to access their medical records and limiting most disclosures of health information to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose. The HIPAA security standards require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures.
 
On February 17, 2009, Congress enacted Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. HITECH amends HIPAA and, among other things, expands and strengthens HIPAA, creates new targets for enforcement, imposes new penalties for noncompliance and establishes new breach notification requirements for Covered Entities. Regulations implementing major provisions of HITECH were finalized on January 25, 2013 through publication of the HIPAA Omnibus Rule (the “Omnibus Rule”).
 
Under HITECH’s new breach notification requirements, Covered Entities must report breaches of protected health information that has not been encrypted or otherwise secured in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the “Secretary”). Required breach notices must be made as soon as is reasonably practicable, but no later than 60 days following discovery of the breach. Reports must be made to affected individuals and to the Secretary and in some cases, they must be reported through local and national media, depending on the size of the breach. Breach reports can lead to investigation and enforcement.
 
We are currently subject to the HIPAA regulations and we will maintain an active compliance program that is designed to identify security incidents and other issues in a timely fashion and enable us to remediate, mitigate harm or report if required by law. We are subject to prosecution and/or administrative enforcement and increased civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, including a new, four-tiered system of monetary penalties adopted under HITECH. We are also subject to enforcement by state attorneys general who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH. To avoid penalties under the HITECH breach notification provisions, we must ensure that breaches of protected health information are promptly detected and reported within the company, so that we can make all required notifications on a timely basis. However, even if we make required reports on a timely basis, we may still be subject to penalties for the underlying breach.
 
In addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to our clinical laboratories. Many states have also implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and protecting test results by strictly limiting the disclosure of those results. State requirements are particularly stringent regarding predictive genetic tests, due to the risk of genetic discrimination against healthy patients identified through testing as being at a high risk for disease. We believe that we will have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations, including genetic testing and genetic information privacy laws in all jurisdictions, both state and federal.
 
We are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. For example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the U.S. This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service, the United States Postal Service and the International Air Transport Association. We will use third-party vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and radioactive materials and contractually require them to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

International regulations
 
We may market our assays outside of the United States and will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing laboratory licensure, human clinical testing, use of tissue, privacy and data security, and marketing approval for our tests. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the United States and may require us to implement additional compliance measures or perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. On September 26, 2012, the European Commission released the first drafts of the new European Union (“EU”) regulations for medical devices and IVDs that if finalized will impose additional regulatory requirements on IVDs used in the EU. In many countries outside of the United States, coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required. We are also required to maintain accurate information and control over sales and distributors’ activities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions.
 
Reimbursement and Billing
 
Reimbursement and billing for diagnostic services is generally highly complex. Laboratories must bill various payors, such as private third-party payors, including MCOs and state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and each may have different billing requirements. Additionally, the audit requirements we must meet to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our internal compliance policies and procedures, add further complexity to the billing process. Other factors that complicate billing include:

● | variability in coverage and information requirements among various payors; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | missing, incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians; 
● | billings to payors with whom we do not have contracts; 
● | disputes with payors as to which party is responsible for payment; and 
● | disputes with payors as to the appropriate level of reimbursement. 

 
Depending on the reimbursement arrangement and applicable law, the party that reimburses us for our services may be:
 

● | a third party who provides coverage to the patient, such as an insurance company or MCO; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | a governmental payor; or 
● | the patient. 

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
A variety of federal laws prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”), and various state agencies. In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly use a variety of contractors to review claims data and to identify improper payments as well as fraud and abuse. Any overpayments identified must be repaid to the Medicare program unless a favorable decision is obtained on appeal. In some cases, these overpayments can be used as the basis for an extrapolation, by which the error rate is applied to a larger universe of claims, and which can result in even higher repayments.

Anti-Kickback Laws
 
The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program. “Remuneration” is broadly defined to include anything of value, such as, for example, cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies or equipment. The Anti-Kickback Statue is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry.
 
Recognizing the breadth of the Anti-Kickback Statute and the fact that it may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the OIG has issued a series of regulations, or safe harbors. Compliance with all requirements of a safe harbor immunizes the parties to the business arrangement from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a business arrangement to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the arrangement is illegal or that the OIG will pursue prosecution. Still, in the absence of an applicable safe harbor, a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may occur even if only one purpose of an arrangement is to induce referrals. The penalties for violating the Anti-Kickback Statute can be severe. These sanctions include criminal and civil penalties, imprisonment and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payor, including private third-party payors.
 
Physician Self-Referral Bans
 
The federal ban on physician self-referrals, commonly known as the Stark Law, prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare patients to an entity providing certain designated health services, which include laboratory services, if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationship with the entity. Several Stark Law exceptions are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including: (1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; (2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; (3) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that satisfy certain requirements; and (4) personal services arrangements. Penalties for violating the Stark Law include the return of funds received for all prohibited referrals, fines, civil monetary penalties and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. In addition to the Stark Law, many states have their own self-referral bans, which may extend to all self-referrals, regardless of the payor.
State and Federal Prohibitions on False Claims
 
The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information. Specific intent to defraud is not required. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action. Penalties include payment of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each false claim, as well as possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. In addition, various states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state health care programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to any payor.

Civil Monetary Penalties Law
 
The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or the CMP Law, prohibits, among other things (1) the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; (2) employing or contracting with an individual or entity that the provider knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal health care program; (3) billing for services requested by an unlicensed physician or an excluded provider; and (4) billing for medically unnecessary services. The penalties for violating the CMP Law include exclusion, substantial fines, and payment of up to three times the amount billed, depending on the nature of the offense.
Employees
 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Company had two active employees, one who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the other who is the Company’s Executive Chairman. The Company has not experienced any work disruptions or stoppages and it considers relations with its employees to be good. No employee of the Company is covered by a collective-bargaining agreement.
