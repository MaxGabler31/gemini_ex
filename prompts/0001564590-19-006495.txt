Overview
 We are a leader in the design, development and marketing of advanced high-speed communications integrated circuits, or ICs, for Ethernet connectivity in the data center, enterprise infrastructure, access and automotive markets. Our Ethernet solutions provide a critical interface between the high-speed analog signals transported over wired infrastructure and the digital information used in computing and networking equipment. Our products are designed to cost-effectively deliver leading-edge data speeds for use in the latest generation of communications infrastructure to alleviate network bandwidth bottlenecks caused by the exponential growth of global Internet Protocol, or IP, traffic. Many of our semiconductor solutions have established benchmarks in the industry in terms of performance, power consumption and density. Our innovative solutions enable our customers to differentiate their product offerings, position themselves to gain market share and drive the ongoing equipment infrastructure upgrade cycles in the data center, enterprise infrastructure, access and automotive markets.
 Ethernet is a ubiquitous and evolving standard of network connectivity that is characterized by its reliability and backward compatibility, which enables easy upgrades and continuity of operation through upgrade cycles. One Gigabit Ethernet, or 1GbE, has been deployed as a mainstream wired connectivity standard for over a decade. However, 1GbE is increasingly insufficient to meet the bandwidth requirements that can accommodate the exponential growth of global IP traffic and demand for high-speed data transfer. As a result, the 1GbE infrastructure is currently undergoing an upgrade cycle that is driven by the need to alleviate bandwidth bottlenecks on the wired side of networking equipment, including the data center (servers and switches), the enterprise infrastructure (wireless access points, or APs, and switches), the access (client connectivity for personal computers, or PCs, and service provider carrier access) and automotive (in-vehicle networking, or IVN) markets. Based on projections by Crehan Research, Inc., 650 Group LLC, IDC, Dell’oro Group, Inc. and Strategy Analytics, we estimate that across these applications, the total available market for multi-gig Ethernet connectivity will reach about 2 billion ports annually by 2022. Historically, the transition to the next Ethernet generation has been led by the introduction of IC solutions that reliably and cost-effectively meet the new Ethernet standard. We believe that the current upgrade cycle will follow the same course. 
 As the data rate of PHY devices continues to increase, the technical challenges of designing high-speed communications ICs require a significantly new architectural approach. In order to meet next-generation performance requirements with low power consumption and a small footprint, our differentiated architecture combines our two fundamental innovations: Mixed-Mode Signal Processing, or MMSP, which partitions signal processing across analog and digital domains, and Multi-Core Signal Processing, or MCSP, which incorporates multiple customized units to more efficiently process digital signals. We also implement patented techniques in Analog Front-End, or AFE, algorithms, power management and programmability in the design of our products. Our Ethernet solutions are being developed by one of the most innovative design teams in the semiconductor industry, with deep expertise across multiple disciplines that range from analog and mixed-mode design to digital signal processing and communication theory. We leverage the expertise of our design team to achieve technological breakthroughs and bring what we believe to be best-in-class semiconductor solutions to market, anticipating the future technological needs of our customers and helping them shape their product roadmaps. Our best-in-class semiconductor solutions provide the functionalities that meet customers’ requirements, as well as the relevant Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, or IEEE, standard. For example, in 2012 we created a novel technology that we call AQrate, which has since been adopted by the IEEE as the baseline for the IEEE 802.3bz standard that was ratified in September 2016 as the industry specifications for 2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T products made by different manufacturers to be compatible with each other. This technology is currently being deployed in the enterprise infrastructure, access and automotive markets.
 We are a fabless semiconductor company. We have shipped tens of millions of ports to customers across multiple advanced semiconductor process generations

Industry Background
 Exponential Growth of Global IP Traffic
 Demands on global networking infrastructure are being driven by the exponential growth of data from video, social networking and advanced collaboration applications. The Cisco Visual Networking Index estimates that global IP traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 26% from 2017 to 2022. Globally, mobile data traffic is also estimated to increase at a CAGR of 46% from 2017 to 2022. The advent of the Internet of Things, or IoT, will also increase pressure on the network infrastructure as a wide variety of electronic devices become connected to the Internet in order to collect and exchange information. 
Transition to 10 Gigabit Ethernet
 Since its inception more than 40 years ago, Ethernet has grown into a global, widely-deployed communications protocol. More specifically, copper Ethernet cables and the associated Ethernet connector, have permeated the vast majority of Internet networks, including data center, enterprise, campus, small and medium-sized business, small-office and home-office (SOHO) and the home. We believe that each transition to higher speeds has enabled the semiconductor company that has been at the forefront of the technological transformation in each upgrade cycle to significantly scale its operations: from National Semiconductor Corporation in the early 1990s, with the transition to 10 Megabit Ethernet, or 10MbE; to Broadcom Corporation in the mid-1990s, with the transition to 100MbE; and to Marvell Semiconductor, Inc. in the early 2000s, with the transition to 1GbE. We believe a similar opportunity now exists with the transition to 10GbE and beyond in the data centers, enterprise infrastructure, access and automotive markets.
 In the early 2000s, the transition from 100MbE to 1GbE was driven by the availability of the technology as a local-area network, or LAN, on motherboard, or LOM, solution for PC applications. A LOM solution allowed every PC manufacturer to offer a 1GbE port on desktops and laptops, which led to a very rapid transition to 1GbE in the entire networking ecosystem. Today, the 1GbE technology has reached broader markets beyond the traditional networking industry, extending into a wide variety of new applications and markets, including home and automotive networking, security camera, signage and smart television connectivity, and high-density wireless environments, such as stadiums and airports. Gigabit Ethernet has now been deployed as a mainstream wired connectivity standard for over a decade and is currently undergoing an upgrade cycle that is driven by the need to alleviate bandwidth bottlenecks on the wired side of networking equipment, including the data center and the enterprise.
 Ethernet Connectivity Solutions
 In order to connect Ethernet networking equipment, such as servers, switches, storage appliances, high-resolution sensors or routers, network engineers have generally used either optical-based glass or plastic fiber cabling or electrical-based copper cabling. Optical interconnect solutions involve the combination of electronics with optical components, such as optical transmitters, optical receivers, optical couplings, packaging and optical fibers. As a result, optical solutions generally have higher relative cost of materials compared to electrical interconnect solutions. Due to the extremely low absorption loss of optical fibers, optical signals can be sent through fiber over very long distances, which are typically hundreds of kilometers or more, making the higher cost of optical solutions a less significant concern for long-reach interconnects. However, for shorter distances within data centers, which are typically less than 100 meters, optical interconnect solutions can be cost-prohibitive. As a result, optical solutions are typically only used in data centers when a comparable electrical solution has not been developed or the distance is too great for the electrical solution to cover.
 Electrical interconnect solutions involve the combination of only a silicon-based IC, a connector and a copper cable. The most prevalent copper interconnect is based on twisted-pair copper cables, also commonly known as Ethernet cables. These cables are relatively inexpensive, but present a number of technical challenges due to significant impairments suffered by the signal as it is transmitted, such as attenuation, crosstalk and echo. As transmission speeds continue to increase to keep up with the exponential growth of global IP traffic, the amount of processing required to be performed in the silicon layer to address these transmission impairments increases correspondingly, leading to greater design complexity and higher power consumption. In recent years, advancements in lithography and manufacturing process technologies have allowed for significantly reduced transistor geometries, resulting in considerably lower power consumption per IC and a greater level of integration. These advancements, as well as additional innovations in the area of digital signal processing, have enabled the use of copper cabling for high-speed data transmission.
 9


Ethernet cable, in its present form, was devised with the standardization by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, or IEEE, of 1MbE in 1986, which was the first of a long line of standards that pushed the speed limits carried over copper cabling. Most recently, the standard evolved into a technology commonly referred to as BASE-T, which started with the introduction of 10BASE-T (speeds of 10 megabits per second, or Mbps) and eventually evolved into the current standard, 10GBASE-T (speeds of 10 gigabits per second, or Gbps). A unique characteristic of BASE-T is its backward compatibility with earlier Ethernet standards. A 10GBASE-T transceiver, for example, is capable of working at the lower speeds of the previous two standards, 1000BASE-T (speeds of 1000Mbps) and 100BASE-T (speeds of 100Mbps). As a result of this backward compatibility, network engineers and IT managers are able to install new equipment in phases and can, for example, purchase 10GBASE-T servers that connect to a legacy 1000BASE-T switch, with the links running at 1GbE. Then, once the switch is replaced with a new 10GBASE-T version, all the links would run at 10GbE.
 The Data Center Market
 Data centers can be categorized as corporate data centers and cloud, or hyperscale, data centers. For both corporate and hyperscale data centers, servers and switches are the two main components of the data center architecture. Traditionally, servers have been located in vertical racks placed side by side in long rows of equipment. Server ports are connected to Ethernet switches, which have the function of directing the traffic to either an upper layer of aggregation (typical of the older client server North-South traffic model) or to other server nodes (typical of the increasing server-to-server East-West traffic model). In the North-South model, traffic flows down to the lower levels for routing services and then back up to reach its destination. In the East-West model, traffic flows are spread across multiple server nodes, requiring hosts to traverse network interconnection points. In either case, the connectivity between the server and the switch ports in a data center is rather short, typically just a few meters, and at most 100 meters. In contrast, the connectivity between switches in the next layers can be quite long depending on the overall topology. As more data is consolidated and processed in data centers, the need for higher performance server nodes has been met with constant innovation in both processor computing power and increased use of server virtualization, both resulting in an increased demand for higher bandwidth connectivity in servers. According to Crehan Research, approximately 80% of all connections currently are between switches and servers (the two main components of data center architecture), and 80% of those connections are electrical, resulting in electrical interconnect solutions accounting for more than 60% of data center connections.
Corporate Data Centers
 Corporate data centers are very cost sensitive and, as a result, have historically made use of Ethernet cabling. Crehan Research estimates that, in 2017, 64% of all server-class Ethernet networking connections shipped were 1GbE connections, 90% of which were 1000BASE-T. We believe that this significant penetration of 1GbE over twisted-pair copper cabling is directly correlated with the preference by corporate IT managers for this medium. In networking infrastructure, cost is a major driver for upgrade cycles and transitions to the newer interconnect technologies. Today, as the cost of 10GbE over twisted-pair copper cabling, or 10GBASE-T, is approaching twice that of 1000BASE-T, network engineers are transitioning their focus to purchasing equipment that supports the faster speed, allowing them to improve performance, increase work efficiency of their organizations and prepare their network for future improvements, which is driving the current upgrade cycle. 
The Enterprise Infrastructure Market
 In the early 2000s, the enterprise infrastructure market experienced a very rapid transition from 100MbE to 1GbE. The adoption of 1GbE as the preferred connectivity between PCs and the Ethernet switches located in server rooms was facilitated by the ease of deployment of Ethernet cables in the ceilings and walls of the enterprise. Category 5e, or Cat5e, and Category 6, or Cat6, cables were, and continue to be, widely deployed, representing more than 90% of the worldwide base of cables installed between 2003 and 2014. In the past 10 years, the enterprise infrastructure market has also seen an increasing number of wireless LAN, or WLAN, APs being deployed throughout buildings, airports, shopping malls and stadiums, driven by the proliferation of smartphones, laptops and other portable devices. These APs generally connect through a 1GbE infrastructure to the wiring closet or campus Ethernet switch using the same Ethernet cabling infrastructure, and often the same switches, used by desktop PCs.
 10


1GbE connections have historically been sufficient to carry the wireless traffic over the wired infrastructure due to the limited bandwidth of the WiFi standards 802.11 b/g/n and even the first wave of 802.11ac. However, WLAN AP manufacturers have commenced the deployment of the second wave of 802.11ac and more recently the following standard, 802.11ax, which has throughput of about 5 to 10Gbps. As a result, for the first time in over a decade, IT managers are faced with the challenge of carrying these bandwidths in excess of 1GbE, or Multi-Gig, over legacy Ethernet infrastructure that is designed to only support 1Gbps. Network administrators have traditionally had three options when confronted with this bottleneck: (1) leave the legacy infrastructure in place and aggregate data traffic over more cables; (2) upgrade to data center-class Ethernet cables that support 10GBASE-T; or (3) upgrade to optical interconnect solutions. The first option presents scalability challenges. The latter two pose significant cost barriers and entail considerable disruption to the physical plan of any building or campus. As a result, there is a need in the enterprise infrastructure market for a scalable, lower-cost alternative to support this network upgrade cycle. 
 The Access Market
 The access market is composed of two sub-categories: client connectivity (PC) and service provider access gateways.
 Client connectivity —As Multi-Gig technology starts permeating the enterprise infrastructure as a PHY solution, replacing the legacy 1GbE connections on Ethernet switches, the need for PCs to adopt this Multi-Gig solution has emerged. Despite the trends towards lighter and thinner machines such as notebooks and laptops, IDC projects that PCs will continue to be equipped with Ethernet ports for the foreseeable future, estimating that 194 million PCs, or approximately 80% of the total market, will ship with an Ethernet port by 2020, driven by enterprise buyers and gamers. Inside PCs, the PHY is typically integrated with an Ethernet data link layer function, as defined in the Open Systems Interconnection model, or OSI model, called a network controller or Media Access Control, or MAC, device. We believe that integrated solutions combining both the PHY and the controller are likely to become the preferred choice of PC original equipment manufacturers.
 Carrier access —Our targeted carrier access market focuses on the last 100 meters between the carrier or service provider termination device, which is typically located in the basement of an apartment complex or the entry-door cabinet in an individual home, and the residential gateway box which is typically owned or leased by the consumer. This last 100 meters is also called wide-area-network, or WAN, and the local-area-network, or LAN, side of the gateway. As carriers and service providers deploy “last-mile” high bandwidth technologies, such as Passive Optical Network, or PON, Digital Subscriber Line, or DSL, and cable modem, the need has arisen to provide high-bandwidth, low-cost, easy-to-deploy solutions to connect termination devices and gateway boxes. The bandwidth requirement is now exceeding 1 Gbps in an increasing number of deployments, on distances that are typically within 100 meters between the termination device and the gateway box. In addition, we anticipate that the availability of Multi-Gig Ethernet on PCs, Network-Attach Storage, or NAS, as well as 802.11ac/ax WiFi extenders and wireless routers, will drive the need for gateways to migrate from 1GbE to Multi-Gig Ethernet on the LAN side as well. 
 The Automotive Market
 The automotive market is undergoing a transformation with the development of self-driving cars. Developing a fully autonomous vehicle requires innovation in the areas of image processing, fast and multi-dimensional decision-making processes, and deep learning, similar to some of the most advanced facial recognition algorithms or complex model simulations being handled by super computers in hyperscale data centers today. As a result, systems that are being contemplated by the car industry to deliver such capabilities will likely need high-speed signaling connecting together end points such as cameras and other sensors, processing units, and an array of switches for rich connectivity and redundancy. Ethernet is one of the most promising technologies to deliver the high-speed connectivity required for making the self-driving car a reality. The car environment has its own very stringent set of requirements such as low weight, low power consumption, limited electro-magnetic emissions and susceptibility, ability to support higher spread of environmental temperature, and low cost. In terms of connectivity, this matrix of requirements is well served by high-speed Multi-Gig Ethernet over copper cabling. The potential market opportunity for Ethernet in the car is considerable, with shipment estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of ports by 2022, according to Strategy Analytics. We are currently shipping products into this market but do not expect significant volume production to occur before 2020.

Our Solution
 We have developed a differentiated architecture that leverages our deep technical design expertise to create integrated high-performance connectivity solutions that address the significant opportunities present in the data center, enterprise infrastructure, access and automotive markets. Our Ethernet PHY solutions provide a critical interface between the high-speed analog signals transported over wired infrastructure and the digital information used in computing and networking equipment. Our architecture combines our two fundamental innovations, MMSP and MCSP, as well as several other patented techniques in AFE design, algorithms, power management and programmability.
 Key features of our highly integrated, mixed-signal ICs include:
  
• | Advanced Analog Front-End Design. Our small form factor, low-power, high-speed and high-resolution data acquisition circuits include the analog-to-digital converter, or ADC, and digital-to-analog converter, or DAC, which provide the interface between the real-world signal coming from the cables and the digital processing engine. Our world-class team of analog engineers designed these complex AFE building blocks to be power efficient, highly reusable across many of our products, and easily scalable with advanced CMOS processes as they emerge.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mixed-Mode Signal Processing Architecture. We have designed a novel analog architecture that we call MMSP, which provides a different partitioning of signal processing between the analog and digital domains. MMSP reduces the complexity of data acquisition circuitry and, as a result, reduces the die size and power consumption of the overall AFE. MMSP also simplifies the digital signal processing logic that follows the ADC.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Multi-Core Signal Processor Architecture. We estimate that the total amount of processing required to counteract the effect of impairments on a Multi-Gig signal as it is transmitted over copper cabling is approximately 10 Tera-operations per second, which is approximately 200 times more than 1GbE. Processing such a large amount of data with a traditional architecture would be highly inefficient and costly. We use our proprietary transistor-level implementation and mapping techniques to create highly efficient multi-core processing engines, which we call MCSPs. Our MCSPs deliver high performance with low power consumption and a small footprint.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extensive Development of Proprietary Advanced Signal Processing Algorithms. The process of detecting and decoding the desired data from a noisy environment requires sophisticated digital signal processing, or DSP, and algorithms that we have developed over the last 10 years with our team of DSP engineers. We believe these algorithms are critical to the performance and the stability of the end customer solution.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advanced Power Management Techniques. Designing a multichannel Ethernet PHY interface that can handle data transfer speeds up to 10Gbps while minimizing leakage power across smaller process geometries presents a significant challenge. However, by combining innovative techniques, our engineers have been able to significantly reduce the impact of static and dynamic leakage power.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fully Configurable Programmable Architecture. We design our semiconductor solutions to operate in a variety of environments and applications. By keeping our architecture programmable, we enable our customers to use the same device in different applications and enjoy the optimum benefits of our solutions. This programmable architecture also enables us to scale across multiple markets and improve our time to market.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While the corporate data center market provides an opportunity for us to serve both server applications and switching applications, historically our core focus has been on, and a significant majority of our data center market revenue has been generated from, the server portion of that market, primarily supporting our relationship with Intel. We initially used these core innovations in the development of 10GBASE-T PHY devices, and subsequently in custom ASICs for Intel that integrate our PHY devices with various elements of Intel’s proprietary technologies. These custom ASICs are driving the transition to 10GbE networking from legacy 1GbE technology in corporate data center server applications. More recently, we employed our fundamental PHY expertise to develop AQrate, our technology designed to improve transmission speeds from 1GbE to 5GbE over existing copper cabling infrastructure in the enterprise infrastructure, access and automotive markets. We are currently developing solutions for Multi-Gig Ethernet over copper to serve the potential automotive market opportunity.

Products
 Our products currently address the data center, enterprise infrastructure, access and automotive markets. We initially focused on the development of 10GBASE-T PHY devices and later, custom ASICs that integrate our PHY devices with customer IP for data center server applications, to lead the transition to 10GbE networking from legacy 1GbE technology. We leveraged our advanced connectivity technology to develop AQrate, a proprietary product designed to significantly improve transmission speeds from 1Gbps to 5Gbps over existing cabling infrastructure in the enterprise infrastructure market. Most recently, we introduced multiple lines of products to serve the access market composed of client connectivity for PCs and service provider access gateways, as well as multi-gig PHY and controller products for automotive
. 
 Corporate Data Center Products
 Our differentiated architecture, combining MMSP and MCSP, was first implemented in the 10GBASE-T line of products, shipping to corporate data center environments. Our architecture’s characteristic low-power, high-performance, and high-density enabled us to demonstrate the world’s first single-chip 10GBASE-T product in 90nm standard CMOS process. This 90nm generation was the first 10GBASE-T product to be deployed in a corporate data center-class Ethernet switch in 2010.
 The follow-on 40nm process generation, unveiled in 2012, led to the world’s first fully integrated 10GBASE-T MAC and PHY products for corporate data center servers. This allowed our server customers to deploy the technology for the first time as a LOM solution as part of the Romley server platform cycle. These ICs were also designed on add-on Network Interface Controller cards. The 40nm process generation, in combination with our architecture, allowed us to deliver the highest density 10GBASE-T quad-port solution for 48-port top-of-rack, or ToR, switches. We have shipped the 40nm generation of products in millions of ports to our server and switching customers, contributing to making 10GBASE-T a mainstream technology in corporate data centers.
 We have since transitioned to the 28nm process generation, continuing to lead the industry, and delivered the world’s first 28nm 10GBASE-T in 2013. While the majority of our revenue was generated by our 40nm products in 2015, our 28nm products are beginning to account for an increasingly significant portion of our revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, 28nm products accounted for 79% and 65% of total revenue, respectively.

Enterprise Infrastructure Products
 The development of the AQrate product line, based on the novel 2.5GbE/5GbE protocol invented by Aquantia, started in 2012 and led to the sampling of our first product in November 2013. This innovative product line was quickly adopted by Cisco and other major switching and WLAN AP OEMs in the ensuing months. Our AQrate product line is composed of single-, dual- quad- and octal-port configurations. The single- and dual-port devices are designed for use in applications ranging from WLAN APs, compact switches, client PCs, storage devices and security cameras, and the quad- and octal-port versions are designed for use in enterprise and campus Ethernet switches. We are currently in full production for our entire line of AQrate products, all of which are manufactured in 28nm and support five Ethernet speeds, including 100M, 1000BASE-T, 2.5GBASE-T, 5GBASE-T and 10GBASE-T. 
Access Products
 - Client Connectivity. We anticipate that, over time, PC OEMs will adopt solutions that integrate the PHY and MAC controller. Our product road map for PC OEMs includes the AQC line (standard product), AQS line (SFP+ modules), and AQN line (NIC), which are all based on our GEN2 AQrate PHYs. These PHYs are low-power, high performance 5-speed 10GBASE-T/5GBASE-T/ 2.5GBASE-T/ 1000BASE-T/ 100BASE-TX transceivers. Our products deliver 2.5GbE and 5GbE network connectivity speeds through 100 meters of Cat 5e cabling. Using a 30-meter Cat 6a cable, 10GbE speeds are achievable. These products are compliant with IEEE 802.3an/802.3bz standards to perform all the physical layer functions required to implement 10GBASE-T/5GBASE-T/ 2.5GBASE-T/1000BASE-T/100BASE-TX transmission over twisted pair cabling.
 - Carrier Access. Our PHY products are designed to also serve the carrier and service provider applications, with their implementation mainly on home gateways potentially replacing 1GbE WAN and LAN ports with multi-gig Ethernet.
 Automotive Products
 As we anticipate that the development of Level 4 and 5 of autonomous vehicle architectures would require bandwidth in excess of 1Gbps, we set out to develop and productize a new product family of multi-gig Ethernet PHYs and MAC controllers, called AQcelerate, specifically for the automotive industry. The AQcelerate line of products allows the transport of data at 2.5GbE, 5GbE and 10GbE over automotive-grade copper cabling. 
Our Customers
 We sell our products directly to IC suppliers, OEMs, original design manufacturers, or ODMs primarily through direct sales. We work closely with our OEM customers throughout their design cycles, and we are able to develop long-term relationships with them as our technology becomes embedded in their products. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned to be designed into their current systems and to continually develop next generation Ethernet solutions for their future products. 
 Across the corporate data center, enterprise infrastructure, access and automotive markets, our customers include Brocade (now part of Extreme Networks), Cisco, Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Intel, Juniper and NEC, among others. Intel is the industry leader in server microprocessors, Cisco is the industry leader in networking infrastructure, and collectively, our customer base represents a significant majority of market share in these industries.
 We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, Intel accounted for approximately 49%, 60%, and 68% of our revenue and Cisco accounted for 27%, 28% and 21% of our revenue, respectively. Our 10 largest customers collectively accounted for 93%, 97% and 98% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No other single customer directly or indirectly accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.
 Sales to customers in Asia accounted for 98%, 99% and 99% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Because many of our customers or their ODMs are located in Asia, we anticipate that a significant portion of our products will continue to be sold to Asia.

Sales and Marketing
 Our design cycle from initial engagement to volume shipment typically ranges from 18 months to three years, depending on whether we are developing an ASSP or an ASIC, with product life cycles of four years or more. For many of our products, early engagement with our customers’ technical staff is critical for success. To ensure an adequate level of early engagement, our application and development engineers work closely with our customers to identify and propose solutions to their systems’ challenges.
 We work closely with our customers, including technology leaders such as Intel and Cisco for the data center and enterprise infrastructure markets, to anticipate end customer market needs. We also participate actively in setting industry standards with organizations such as IEEE to ensure that we have a voice in the definition of future market trends.
 We sell our products worldwide through multiple channels, including our direct sales force, a network of third-party sales representatives and distributors. For major accounts in the United States and some overseas markets, we rely on our direct sales team located in the United States and Taiwan, while for others, we collaborate with third-party sales representatives and distributors in the United States, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
 Manufacturing
 We operate a fabless business model and use third-party foundries and assembly and test manufacturing contractors to manufacture, assemble and test our semiconductor products. This outsourced manufacturing approach allows us to focus our resources on the design, sale and marketing of our products. In addition, we believe that outsourcing many of our manufacturing and assembly activities provides us with the flexibility needed to respond to new market opportunities, simplifies our operations and significantly reduces our capital commitments.
 We subject our third-party manufacturing contractors to qualification requirements to meet the high quality and reliability standards required of our products. We carefully qualify each of our partners and their processes before applying the technology to our products. Our engineers work closely with our foundries and other contractors to increase yield, lower manufacturing costs and improve product quality.
  
• | Wafer Fabrication. We currently utilize a wide range of semiconductor process generations to develop and manufacture our products. For most of our products, we use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, and GLOBALFOUNDRIES for semiconductor wafer production.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Package, Assembly and Testing. Upon the completion of processing at the foundry, we use third-party contractors for packaging, assembly and testing, including Amkor, STATS ChipPAC and ASE in Taiwan and Korea.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Warehousing. JSI in Hong Kong warehouses our products, providing easy transport and accessibility from the assembly and test sites.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research and Development
 We believe that our future success depends on our ability to introduce enhancements on our existing products and to develop new products for both existing and new markets. As such, a significant majority of our operating expenses has been allocated to this effort. Our research and development efforts are directed to the development of additional high-performance connectivity semiconductor solutions across a range of process technologies.
 We have assembled a core team of experienced engineers and systems designers in five design centers located in the United States, Canada, India, the Netherlands and Russia. Our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $56.0 million, $44.8 million and $36.6 million, respectively.

Competition
 The global semiconductor market in general, and the data center and wireless communications infrastructure in particular, is highly competitive. We compete in different target markets on the basis of a number of competitive factors. We expect competition to increase and intensify as additional semiconductor companies enter our markets, and as internal silicon design resources of large OEMs grow. Increased competition could result in price pressure, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could harm our business, revenue and results of operations.
 Our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products to smaller companies specializing in narrow market verticals. In the enterprise and data center markets, our primary competitors are Broadcom and Marvell. We expect competition in our current markets to increase in the future as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new competitors enter these markets. In addition, our future growth will depend in part on our ability to successfully enter and compete in new markets. Some of these markets will likely be served by only a few large, multinational OEMs with substantial negotiating and buying power relative to us and, in some instances, with internally developed silicon solutions that can be competitive to our products.
 Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including industry and general economic trends. During past periods of downturns in our industry, competition in the markets in which we operate intensified as our customers reduced their purchase orders. Many of our competitors are substantially larger, have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support and other resources, are more established than we are and have significantly better brand recognition and broader product offerings which may enable them to better withstand similar adverse economic or market conditions in the future. Any such development may materially and adversely affect our current and future target markets and our ability to compete successfully in those markets.
 We compete or plan to compete in different target markets to various degrees on the basis of a number of principal competitive factors, including:
  
• | product performance;
--+---------------------


• | power budget;
--+--------------


• | features and functionality;
--+----------------------------


• | customer relationships;
--+------------------------


• | size;
--+------


• | ease of system design;
--+-----------------------


• | product roadmap;
--+-----------------


• | reputation and reliability;
--+----------------------------


• | customer support;
--+------------------


• | research and development;
--+--------------------------


• | high-level talent, including our management team and engineers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | price.
--+-------

 We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. We maintain our competitive position through our ability to successfully design, develop and market complex Ethernet connectivity solutions for the customers we serve.

Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, and contractual protections, to protect our core technology and intellectual property. As of December 31, 2018, we had 99 issued patents, 87 of which are U.S. patents, and 28 pending and provisional U.S. patent applications. The 87 issued patents in the U.S. generally expire between 2024 and 2037. Our issued patents and pending patent applications relate to both our 10GBASE-T PHYs, our AQrate PHYs, controller and QuantumStream technologies.
 We may not receive competitive advantages from any rights granted under our patents, and our patent applications may not result in the issuance of any patents. In addition, any future patents may be opposed, contested, circumvented, designed around by a third party or found to be unenforceable or invalidated. Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies, duplicate our proprietary technologies or design around patents owned or licensed by us. Further, we may be required to license certain of our patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms to our competitors due to having promoted the adoption of certain IEEE standards.
 We generally control access to and use of our confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors and customers. We rely in part on the laws of the United States and international laws to protect our work. All employees and consultants are required to evaluate confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment and consulting relationships with us. We also require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived or made in connection with the employment or consulting relationship.
 Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary intellectual property. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited to foreign countries.
 The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions, which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. We have in the past received and, particularly as a public company, we expect that in the future we may receive, communications liability for damages that may invalidate our proprietary rights and harm our business and our ability to compete. Any litigation, regardless of success or merit, could cause us to incur substantial expenses, reduce our sales and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. In the event we receive an adverse result in any litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, seek licenses from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, cease sale of products, expend significant resources to develop alternative technology or discontinue the use of processes requiring the relevant technology.
