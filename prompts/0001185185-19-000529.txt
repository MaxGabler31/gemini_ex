ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Our Corporate History and Background
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 5, 2013. Our original business plan was to sell freshly squeezed juices from mobile stands in London, United Kingdom, but this business was not successful and we did not generate any revenue from this business.
 
On April 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of PGL and as a result, PGL became our wholly-owned subsidiary and the former shareholders of PGL became the holders of approximately 98.4% of our issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully-diluted basis. We changed our name to Porter Holding International, Inc. on May 8, 2017 to more accurately reflect our new business. For accounting purposes, the transaction with PGL was treated as a reverse acquisition, with PGL as the acquirer and the Company as the acquired party. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this report to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the reverse acquisition, we are referring to the business and financial information of PGL and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
As described below in more detail, through our PRC VIEs that have contractual arrangements with PGL’s subsidiary, Qianhai Porter, we are at the early stage of developing our O2O (Online to Offline) business and our goal is to become a leading innovative O2O business platform operator providing both online E-commerce and offline physical business facilities to our customers.
 
Our Corporate Structure
 
PRC laws and regulations prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of companies that operate Internet information and content, Internet access, online games, mobile, value added telecommunications and certain other businesses in which we are engaged or could be deemed to be engaged.  Consequently, we conduct certain of our operations and businesses in the PRC through our VIEs.
 
PGL, a Seychelles holding company, was formed on October 13, 2016. The share capital of the company is $50,000 divided into 500,000,000 ordinary shares of $0.0001 par value each. On December 6, 2016, the authorized and issued capital of PGL increased to $725,000 divided into 7,250,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.0001 each. PGL was owned and controlled by the same control group as PPBGL and Portercity.
 
On November 29, 2016, Mr. Zongiian Chen, the sole shareholder of PPBGL, transferred 100% of the outstanding shares of PPBGL to PGL. The share transfer has been accounted for as a common control transaction. Other than its 100% ownership of PPBGL, PGL has no significant assets and no other business operations.
 
PPBGL was incorporated in Hong Kong on September 21, 2016 as a company with limited liability as an investment holding company. Upon incorporation, PPBGL issued 1 ordinary share at HK$1. Also on September 21, 2016, an additional 9,999 ordinary shares were issued, and Mr. Zongjian Chen held all the 10,000 ordinary shares of PPBGL on behalf of the original investors of Portercity. PPBGL is currently controlled by Mr. Zongjian Chen and other investors and has no significant assets or business operations.
 
Qianhai Porter was incorporated in the PRC as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise with limited liability on November 21, 2016. Qianhai Porter was set up by PPBGL. Qianhai Porter was incorporated to control the shareholders’ voting interests in Portercity and become the primary beneficiary of Portercity and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Porter E-Commerce, Porter Consulting and Porter Commercial.
 
Portercity was held by Mr. Zonghua Chen (brother of Mr. Zongjian Chen) and Ms. Xiaomei Xiong (spouse of Mr. Zongjian Chen) on behalf of other investors, including Mr. Zonghua Chen himself.
 
On December 1, 2016, Portercity acquired a 100% equity interest in Porter Consulting, from Shenzhen Porter Holdings Co., Ltd., for a cash consideration of $144,154 (RMB1,000,000).

On December 15, 2016, our indirectly wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary, Qianhai Porter, Portercity and the shareholders of Portercity entered into the following commercial arrangements, or collectively, VIE Agreements, pursuant to which we have contractual rights to control and operate the businesses of Portercity and Portercity’s three Chinese subsidiaries, Porter E-Commerce, Porter Consulting and Porter Commercial:
 

● | Pursuant to a commission management and consulting services agreement, or the Service Agreement, Qianhai Porter agreed to act as the exclusive management and advisory consultant of Portercity and provide client management, marketing promotion counseling, corporate management and counseling, finance counseling and personnel training services to Portercity. In exchange, Portercity agreed to pay Qianhai Porter a management and consulting fee to be equivalent to the amount of net profit before tax of Portercity; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursuant to an exclusive right and option to purchase agreement, or the Option Agreement, the shareholders of Portercity granted to Qianhai Porter the exclusive right and option to purchase, at any time during the term of the Option Agreement, all of the assets of and equity interests shares in Portercity, at the exercise price equal to the lowest possible price permitted by Chinese laws;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursuant to a shareholders’ voting rights proxy agreement, or the Voting Rights Agreement, each of the shareholders of Portercity irrevocably appointed the representatives designated by Qianhai Porter to exercise its exclusive voting right of shareholders in the general meeting of shareholders of Portercity; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursuant to an equity interest pledge agreement, the Pledge Agreement, the shareholders of Portercity pledged all of the equity interests in Portercity and any and all legitimate income generated from such equity interests to Qianhai Porter to ensure the rights, privileges and concessions of Qianhai Porter under this and the above contractual arrangements.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The foregoing description of the VIE Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the VIE Agreements, a copy of each of the VIE Agreements is incorporated by reference as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.4 hereto.
 
As a result of the above contractual arrangements, or the Contractual Arrangements, we maintain substantial control over the VIEs’ daily operations and financial affairs, election of their senior executives and all matters requiring shareholder approval.  Furthermore, as the primary beneficiary of the VIEs, we are entitled to consolidate the financial results of the VIEs in our own consolidated financial statements under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 810 and related subtopics related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, or ASC Topic 810.
 
In the opinion of Guang Dong LianRui Law Firm, our PRC legal counsel:
 

● | the ownership structures of our wholly-foreign owned enterprise and VIEs in China do not and will not violate any applicable PRC law, regulation, or rule currently in effect; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the contractual arrangements between our material wholly-foreign owned enterprise, our material variable interest entity and the variable interest entity equity holders governed by PRC laws are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws, rules, and regulations currently in effect, and will not violate any applicable PRC law, regulation, or rule currently in effect.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
However, we have been further advised by our PRC legal counsel, Guang Dong LianRui Law Firm, that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities may, in the future, take a view that is contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel. We have been further advised by our PRC legal counsel that if the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our Internet-based business do not comply with PRC government restrictions on foreign investment in the aforesaid business we engage in, we could be subject to severe penalties including being prohibited from continuing operations. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to our Commercial Relationship with VIEs.”

The chart below presents our corporate structure as of the date of this report: 
 


Our principal executive offices are located at 36th Floor, Shenzhen Development Center, #2010, Renmin South Road, Luohu District, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, 518001. The telephone number at our principal executive office is 86-755-22230666.
 
Our Business Plan 
 
With the development of mobile Internet, e-commerce, social networks, physical stores and the coming of big data economy era, the online and offline worlds are becoming increasingly more integrated. The Online to Offline (O2O) business model that contains the original business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C) and consumer-to-consumer (C2C) is in the rapid development., O2O is no longer a one-way consumption model, which neither merely guides traditional purchasers to consume online nor only leads online consumers to enjoy offline experience or service.
 
However, the O2O commerce solutions industry in China is still in its early stages of development and is heavily fragmented with a wide range of services being introduced. The O2O category stretches to include on-demand services like Didi Chuxing, the Chinese equivalent of Uber, Meituan and Dianping, China’s Groupon and Yelp, as well as click-and-collect services offered by traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. In China O2O also covers all manner of services that might not be cost effective to offer in Western markets, including pick-up dry cleaning, home haircuts or wholesale and fresh market delivery services.
 
We are a commercial platform provider that offers “O2O (network + entity)*service” and only focus on commodities and merchants. First, we provide commodities with concrete platforms and operation in terms of online marketing coverage and offline marketing services. The online marketing coverage refers to services such as global display of commodities information, sales, procurement, payment. The offline marketing services include offline storage, logistics, distribution, exhibition, order, wholesale, retail, brokerage, purchasing, after-sales services, which can certainly be synchronized with the online marketing coverage.
 
Secondly, we provide merchants with concrete platforms and operation in terms of online marketing coverage and offline marketing services. The online marketing coverage for merchants refers to services such as global promotion of corporate brand & image of merchants, layout of distributor and agency channels, sharing of supply and demand information, creation of commercial credit, recruitment of talents. The offline marketing services are offered to merchants with value-added services such as brand marketing, financial services, credit guarantees, capital market access and public listing, training, education, summits, government relations, and third-party professional services referrals.

Specifically, we are currently developing and plan to provide following core products and services to our customers:
 
1. Our PT37.com platform (also known as "platform business opportunity" with ICP qualification, established and went into operation at 2009), is a commercial cloud platform, in which all kinds of global small and medium-sized enterprises can apply for access and obtain services free of charge. It is a professional information-supply-and-demand platform with high degree of flexibility, in which enterprises could achieve enterprise informatization within a short time. Through the platform, the enterprises can internally realize IMIS information management and externally release information, display product and services. At present, the categories of products on the pt37.com platform include books, videos, instruments, household appliances, electronic products, home furniture, clothing, automobiles, toys, food and beauty. Each category could be further divided into sub-categories with various search criteria and parameters, allowing merchants to accurately search for information and increase the relevance of searched results. Currently, there are millions of member companies registered on the platform. We do not charge them but we will select high-quality merchant customers based on the transaction volume to enter our O2O platform for operation. In other words, this is a customer resources screening pool as well as the starting point of our "O2O (Network + Entity) * Services" business model.
 
2. Our 17yugo.com platform (also known as: Porter E-Mall, with ICP qualifications, established and went into operation at 2018) is the online section of our "O2O (Network + Entity) * Services" business model. Currently hundreds of merchants have been selected from member enterprises and thousands of goods of origin have been stationed. In the future, these merchants and products will be stationed in offline Port City simultaneously, and the layout of Porter E-Mall will be synchronized with the physical Port City.
 
3. Our Port City platform is offline section of our "O2O (Network + Entity) * Services" business model. Regional center cities are top choices of Port City, which may cover more than 1 million square meters. Each Port City will have functions including exhibition, brokerage, procurement, wholesale, order, hotel, conference, warehousing, logistics, distribution and payment. At the same time, within the 200-kilometer range around the Potter City, the traditional 50-square-meter physical stores will be upgraded to form “satellite” physical stores in Porter City with in-depth sales and other services.
 
Port City platform is built by third parties or through cooperation with third-party property owners. We conduct management and profit earning through operating the platform. The first physical Port City is currently under construction, and the upgrades of nearly thousands of “satellite” stores have been completed.
 
4. Our payment platform is dedicated to the development of internet software and hardware services for enterprises and individuals. At present, the external services include Internet payment, mobile payment, POS machine receipt, electronic technology development, and Internet marketing services, while the internal services are to provide payment services for our own O2O platform.
 
Since 2017 and 2018, we have carried out a large number of value-added services for all of our merchant members and customers based on the simultaneous operation of the “O2O (Network + Entity) * Service” business model, and thus earned revenues. In 2017, by collecting conference fees, we organized member companies to conduct new economic summits and forums to preach and disseminate our “O2O (network + entity) * service” business model. In 2018, we began to screen member merchant enterprises to enter our O2O platform, and provided them with “O2O (network + entity) * service” commercial operation services. For those qualified enterprises, we offer public listing consulting services, which help us achieve good returns. At the beginning of 2019, we began to expand the global trade and commodity import and export business of the stationed enterprises.
 
Investment and Corporate Management Consulting Services 
 
According to the development demand and future goals of our customers, in 2018 we started to offer a series of services such as business planning, financial guidance, business matching and guidance for listing primarily in the United States. At present, in our customer pool, many small and medium-sized enterprises have increased their public awareness. They are seeking the potential advantages of being a listed company and striving for obtaining the recognition of international capital to accelerate their corporate expansion. But many enterprises themselves may not be familiar with the listing requirements, laws and regulations of different capital markets, and the process of obtaining financing from overseas markets.
 
In order to help our customers who intend to access to the overseas capital market, we have a team of experienced professionals who have professional knowledge of the listing rules and regulations of various capital markets. We will make full use of our expertise and resources in the capital markets to assist these customers to achieve their goals.

Starting from the second quarter of 2018, through Portercity and Porter Commercial, we have been providing investment and corporate management consulting services to our clients, especially those who have the intention to be public listed in the stock exchanges in the United States and other countries. We categorize our consulting services into three phases:
 

● | Phase I consulting services primarily include due diligence review, market research and feasibility study, business plan drafting, accounting record review, and business analysis and recommendations. We estimate that Phase I normally takes around three months to complete based on our past experiences.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase II consulting services primarily include reorganization, pre-listing education and tutoring, talent search, legal and audit firm recommendation and coordination, VIE contracts and other public-listing related documents review, merger and acquisition planning, investor referral and pre-listing equity financing source identification and recommendation, independent directors and audit committee candidates recommendation. We estimate that Phase II normally takes about five months to complete based our past experiences.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase III consulting services primarily include shell company identification and recommendation for customers expecting to become publicly listed through reverse merger transaction; assistance in preparation of customers’ registration statement under IPO transactions or Form 8-K under reverse merger transactions; assistance in answering comments and questions received from regulatory agencies. We believe it is very difficult to estimate the timing of this phase of service as the completion of Phase III services is not within our control.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Each phase of consulting services is standalone and fees associated with each phase are usually clearly identified in service agreements. Revenue from providing Phase I and Phase II consulting services to customers is recognized ratably over the estimated completion period of each phase only when we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Otherwise, such revenue is recognized at a point in time when services are delivered and accepted by customers. Revenue from providing Phase III consulting services to customers is recognized upon completion of reverse merger transaction or IPO transaction, which is evidenced by filing of an 8-K for reverse merger transaction or receipt of effective notice from regulatory agencies for IPO transactions. Revenue that has been billed and not yet recognized is reflected as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets.
 
Depending on the complexity of the underlying service arrangement and related terms and conditions, significant judgments, assumptions and estimates may be required to determine when substantial delivery of contract elements has occurred, whether any significant ongoing obligations exist subsequent to contract execution, whether amounts due are collectible and the appropriate period or periods in which, or during which, the completion of the earnings process occurs. Depending on the magnitude of specific revenue arrangements, adjustment may be made to the judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding contracts executed in any specific period.
 
On June 28, 2018, Portercity and Mr. Zhibo Mao established Weifang Portercity in Weifang, Shandong Province, the PRC, with a registered capital of RMB1,000,000 (approximately $146,000). Portercity and Mr. Zhibo Mao hold 60% and 40% equity interest in Weifang Portercity, respectively. Weifang Portercity is intended to be engaged in the business of providing various consulting services to its clients, especially to those who have the intention to be publicly listed in the stock exchanges in the United States and other countries. As of December 31, 2018, Weifang Portercity has not commenced operations.
 
Our Customers
 
Currently, through our VIE entity, Porter Consulting, we partner with China Payment, a third-party online payment service provider, to promote China Payment’s online payment platform to companies and businesses in Shenzhen and in return share a portion of the processing fees earned by China Payment as commission. 
 
In addition, Porter Consulting partners with Shenzhen Tongfu, a third-party online payment service provider, under which Porter Consulting agreed to promote Shenzhen Tongfu’s online payment platform, including the Point of Sale (POS) system, to companies and businesses in China and in return obtain a certain amount of commission based on the volume of trading through such online payment platform.
 
Starting from the second quarter of 2018, through Portercity and Porter Commercial, we have been providing investment and corporate management consulting services to our clients, especially those who have the intention to be publicly listed in the stock exchanges in the United States and other countries. They are usually small and medium-sized enterprises based in China.

We registered www.17yugo.com and www.pt37.com as our domain names on March 16, 2010 and September 16, 2008, respectively.
 
Our Competition
 
Our competitors in China include (i) major e-commerce companies, such as Alibaba Group, which operates taobao.com and tmall.com, and JD.com, Inc.; (2) major traditional brick and mortar shopping centers that aim to offer a one-stop shopping experience, such as Walmart China supercenters and Mixc malls. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry include network coverage, brand recognition and reputation, product quality, selection and pricing and quality of customer service.  While many of our current or potential competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources, longer operating histories and more established brand names and relationships than we do, we are confident that our business model will offer our customers one-stop services at a relatively low price and accordingly enhance our competitive position.
Regulation
 
Because all of our operating entities are located in the PRC, we are regulated by the national and local laws of the PRC. This section summarizes the major PRC regulations relating to our business.
The Telecommunications Regulations
 
The Telecommunications Regulations, promulgated by the PRC State Council on September 25, 2000 and amended on February 6, 2016, set out the general framework under which domestic Chinese companies such as the Company’s PRC subsidiaries and VIEs may engage in various types of telecommunications services in the PRC.  The regulations reiterate the long-standing principle that telecommunications service providers need to obtain operating licenses as a mandatory precondition to begin operation in this sector in China.  The Chinese government restricts foreign investment in Internet-related businesses.  Accordingly, we operate our Internet-related businesses in China through Portercity, our VIE operating in Shenzhen China.
Industry Catalogue Relating to Foreign Investment
 
The Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment, or the Catalogue, was promulgated and has been amended from time to time by the Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and Reform Commission. In Catalogue, Industries for foreign investment are divided into three categories: encouraged, restricted and prohibited.  Establishment of wholly foreign-owned enterprises is generally allowed in encouraged industries. Some restricted industries are limited to equity or contractual joint ventures, while in some cases Chinese partners are required to hold the majority interests in such joint ventures. In addition, restricted category projects are subject to higher-level government approvals. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category. Industries not listed in the Catalogue are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations.
 
 8


Through our subsidiaries and VIEs, we are engaged in certain industries that are classified as “restricted” or “prohibited” under the Catalogue. Pursuant to the latest Catalogue amended in March 2015, the provision of value-added telecommunications services falls in the restricted category and the percentage of foreign ownership cannot exceed 50% (excluding e-commerce).
 
Under PRC law, the establishment of a wholly foreign owned enterprise is subject to the approval of the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts and the wholly foreign owned enterprise must register with the competent industry and commerce bureau.
 
Foreign Investment in Value-Added Telecommunications Businesses
 
The Regulations for Administration of Foreign-invested Telecommunications Enterprises promulgated by the PRC State Council in December 2001 and subsequently amended in February 2016 set forth detailed requirements with respect to capitalization, investor qualifications and application procedures in connection with the establishment of a foreign-invested telecommunications enterprise. These regulations prohibit a foreign entity from owning more than 50% of the total equity interest in any value-added telecommunications service business in China and require the major foreign investor in any value-added telecommunications service business in China have a good and profitable record and operating experience in this industry.
The Measures for the Administration of Internet Information Services
 
The governing law for Internet information service is the Measures for the Administration of Internet Information Services, or the Internet Content Provider (“ICP”) Measures, which went into effect on September 25, 2000. Under the ICP Measures, any entity that provides information to online Internet users must obtain an operating license from Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (“MIIT”) or its local branch at the provincial level in accordance with the Telecom Regulations described above.
 
The ICP Measures further stipulate that entities providing online information services in areas of news, publishing, education, medicine, health, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment must obtain permission from responsible national authorities prior to applying for an operating license from MIIT or its local branch at the provincial or municipal level. Moreover, ICPs must display their operating license numbers in a conspicuous location on their websites.  ICPs must police their websites to remove categories of harmful content that are broadly defined. Currently, our VIE, Portercity holds an ICP license which was issued on March 7, 2014, expiring on March 7, 2019. We are currently in the process of renewing our ICP license.
 
Online Privacy
 
Chinese law does not prohibit internet service providers from collecting and analyzing personal information from their users if the users agree to do so. The PRC government, however, has the power and authority to order internet service providers to submit personal information of an internet user if such user posts any prohibited content or engages in illegal activities on the internet.
 
Under the Several Provisions on Regulating the Market Order of Internet Information Services (“Order”) promulgated by the MIIT which became effective on March 15, 2012, internet service providers may not, without a user’s consent, collect the user’s personal information that can be used, alone or in combination with other information, to identify the user, and may not provide any user’s personal information to third parties without the prior consent of the user. Internet service providers may only collect users’ personal information necessary to provide their services and must expressly inform the users of the method, scope and purpose of the collection and processing of such information. They are also required to ensure the proper security of users’ personal information, and take immediate remedial measures if such information is suspected to have been inappropriately disclosed. When a User registers to our application, we require our users to accept a user agreement whereby they agree to provide certain personal information to us. We will take other measures as necessary to comply with these provisions.
 
ICPs are also required to establish and publish their rules relating to personal information collection or use, keep any collected information strictly confidential, and take technological and other measures to maintain the security of such information. ICP operators are required to cease any collection or use of the user personal information, and de-register the relevant user account, when a given user stops using the relevant Internet service. ICP operators are further prohibited from divulging, distorting or destroying any such personal information, or selling or providing such information unlawfully to other parties. In addition, if an ICP operator appoints an agent to undertake any marketing and technical services that involve the collection or use of personal information, the ICP operator is still required to supervise and manage the protection of the information. As to penalties, in very broad terms, the Order states that violators may face warnings, fines, and disclosure to the public and, in most severe cases, criminal liability.

Foreign Currency Exchange
 
Under the Foreign Currency Administration Rules promulgated in 1996 and revised in 1997, and various regulations issued by state administration of foreign exchange (SAFE) and other relevant PRC government authorities, RMB is convertible into other currencies without prior approval from SAFE only to the extent of current account items, such as trade related receipts and payments, interest and dividends and after complying with certain procedural requirements. The conversion of RMB into other currencies and remittance of the converted foreign currency outside PRC for the purpose of capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, requires the prior approval from SAFE or its local office. Payments for transactions that take place within China must be made in RMB. Unless otherwise approved, PRC companies must repatriate foreign currency payments received from abroad. Foreign-invested enterprises may retain foreign exchange in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks subject to a cap set by SAFE or its local office. Unless otherwise approved, domestic enterprises must convert all of their foreign currency proceeds into RMB.
 
On October 21, 2005, SAFE issued the Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-raising and Reverse Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, which became effective as of November 1, 2005. According to the notice, a special purpose company, or SPV, refers to an offshore company established or indirectly controlled by PRC residents for the special purpose of carrying out financing of their assets or equity interest in PRC domestic enterprises. Prior to establishing or assuming control of an SPV, each PRC resident, whether a natural or legal person, must complete the overseas investment foreign exchange registration procedures with the relevant local SAFE branch. The notice applies retroactively. As a result, PRC residents who have established or acquired control of these SPVs that previously made onshore investments in China were required to complete the relevant overseas investment foreign exchange registration procedures by March 31, 2006. These PRC residents must also amend the registration with the relevant SAFE branch in the following circumstances: (i) the PRC residents have completed the injection of equity investment or assets of a domestic company into the SPV; (ii) the overseas funding of the SPV has been completed; (iii) there is a material change in the capital of the SPV. Under the rules, failure to comply with the foreign exchange registration procedures may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the violator, including restrictions on the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent company, and may also subject the violators to penalties under the PRC foreign exchange administration regulations.
 
On August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated Circular 142 which regulates the conversion by a foreign-funded enterprise of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. In addition, SAFE promulgated Circular 45 on November 9, 2011 in order to clarify the application of Circular 142. Under Circular 142 and Circular 45, the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Violations of Circular 142 and Circular 45 could result in severe penalties, such as heavy fines as set out in the relevant foreign exchange control regulations.  On July 4, 2014, SAFE promulgated SAFE Circular 36, which launched a pilot reform of the administration of the settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of foreign-invested enterprises in certain designated areas from August 4, 2014. However, SAFE Circular 36 continues to prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from directly or indirectly using the Renminbi converted from their foreign exchange capitals for purposes beyond its business scope.  On March 30, 2015, SAFE promulgated Circular 19, to expand the reform nationwide. Circular 19 will come into force and replace both Circular 142 and Circular 36 on June 1, 2015. Circular 36 allows enterprises established within the pilot areas to use their foreign exchange capitals to make equity investment and removes certain other restrictions provided under Circular 142 for these enterprises. Circular 19 will remove those restrictions for all foreign-invested enterprises established in the PRC. However, both Circular 36 and Circular 19 continue to prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from, among other things, using the Renminbi fund converted from its foreign exchange capitals for expenditure beyond its business scope, providing entrusted loans or repaying loans between non-financial enterprises.
 
Dividend Distributions
 
Under applicable PRC regulations, foreign invested enterprises (FIEs) in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a FIE in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until the accumulative amount of such reserves reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. The board of directors of a FIE has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.

After-tax profits/losses with respect to the payment of dividends out of accumulated profits and the annual appropriation of after-tax profits as calculated pursuant to PRC accounting standards and regulations do not result in significant differences as compared to after-tax earnings as presented in our financial statements. However, there are certain differences between PRC accounting standards and regulations and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, arising from different treatment of items such as amortization of intangible assets and change in fair value of contingent consideration rising from business combinations.
 
In addition, under the enterprise income tax (EIT) Law, the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Negotiated Reduction of Dividends and Interest Rates, which was issued on January 29, 2008, the Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion, which became effective on December 8, 2006, and the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation Regarding Interpretation and Recognition of Beneficial Owners under Tax Treaties, which became effective on October 27, 2009, dividends from our PRC operating subsidiaries paid to us through our Hong Kong subsidiary may be subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 10%, or at a rate of 5% if our Hong Kong subsidiary is considered a “beneficial owner” that is generally engaged in substantial business activities and entitled to treaty benefits under the Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion.
 
Laws and Regulations Related to Employment and Labor Protection
 
On June 29, 2007, the National People’s Congress promulgated the Employment Contract Law of PRC (“Employment Contract Law”), which became effective as of January 1, 2008 and amended on December 28, 2012. The Employment Contract Law requires employers to provide written contracts to their employees, restricts the use of temporary workers and aims to give employees long-term job security.
 
Pursuant to the Employment Contract Law, employment contracts lawfully concluded prior to the implementation of the Employment Contract Law and continuing as of the date of its implementation shall continue to be performed. Where an employment relationship was established prior to the implementation of the Employment Contract Law but no written employment contract was concluded, a contract must be concluded within one month after its implementation.
 
On September 18, 2008, the State Council promulgated the Implementing Regulations for the PRC Employment Contract Law which came into effect immediately. These regulations interpret and supplement the provisions of the Employment Contract Law.
 
Our standard employment contract complies with the requirements of the Employment Contract Law and its implementing regulations. We have entered into written employment contracts with all of our employees.
