Item 1. Business.
Business Overview
Innodata Inc. (NASDAQ: INOD) (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Innodata”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a global data engineering company. Our mission is to deliver the promise of AI to the world’s most prestigious companies.
We provide AI-enabled software platforms and managed services to companies that require high-quality data for training AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms. We also provide AI digital transformation solutions and platforms to help companies apply AI/ML to real-world problems relating to analyzing and deriving insights from documents. For industry-specific, document-intensive industry business processes, we provide AI-augmented software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms and discrete managed services.
Our platforms and services are powered by Goldengate, our proprietary AI/ML platform, as well as other technologies we have developed. In addition, we bring to bear more than 4,500 employees spanning eight countries with expertise in data pertaining to many professional fields. Our hybrid approach of using AI/ML in conjunction with human experts enables us to deliver superior data quality with even the most complex and sensitive data.
We developed our capabilities and honed our customer- and quality-centric culture progressively over the last 30 years creating high-quality data for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately six years ago, we formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to our large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, we began packaging the capabilities that emerged from our R&D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI/ML to drive performance benefits and business insights. We anticipate this strategy will enable us to accelerate growth.
Market Opportunities
AI Data Annotation
Companies across industry verticals are increasingly seeking to develop AI-based applications for an ever-increasing variety of use cases such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, automated medical diagnostics, digital assistants and chatbots, content moderation, robotics and contract review. These applications depend upon high-performing AI algorithms in areas such as speech recognition, image recognition, and text recognition.
Unlike traditional computer applications that are programmed in languages like Python and Java to tell computers what to do, AI applications can be created with little to no programming. Instead, AI applications are trained with large quantities of input data and expected output data. Leveraging such data, the AI application learns on its own from the data itself through a series of regressions. Developing high-quality training data is critical for the AI to perform correctly, but often requires technology and skilled human resources that data science teams lack. Moreover, developing high-quality data takes up 80% of the time for most AI and ML projects.1
We train AI algorithms for social media companies, robotics companies, financial services companies, and many others, working with images, text, video and audio. Data sciences teams seek partners that can perform data preparation functions for them at large-scale and at high quality, while using automated tools to minimize cost. Moreover, as AI projects become more specialized and mission-critical, data preparation is becoming increasingly complex, requiring deep domain knowledge and an infrastructure in which data security is assured. We believe that Innodata is ideally situated to be such a partner.
We utilize a variety of leading third-party image and video annotation tools. For text, we use our proprietary data annotation platform that incorporates AI to reduce cost while improving consistency and quality of output. Our proprietary text annotation platform features auto-tagging capabilities that apply to both classical and generative AI tasks. It also encapsulates many of the innovations we have conceived of in the course of our 30-year history of creating high-quality data. In November 2021 we announced the general availability of our text annotation platform for customer use which we anticipate will be a source of competitive differentiation and SaaS licensing revenue.
The AI data training market is expected to grow to $3.5 billion by the end of 2024,2 essentially proxying the enormous growth expected in AI system spending overall ($85.3 billion in 2021, $204 billion in 2025, a 24.5% CAGR).3 Similarly, the global data annotation tools market was valued at $695 million in 2019, projected to reach $6.5 billion by 2027, which is a CAGR of 33%.4

AI Digital Transformation
We also provide AI solutions and platforms to companies that intensively process textual data and seek to obtain the benefits of AI/ML technologies without having to develop AI/ML engineering capabilities in-house. For such companies, we often integrate one or more of our pre-trained text processing algorithms as a foundation for an overall solution. Our algorithms are accessible as microservices via application programming interfaces (APIs), enabling easy integration.
In conjunction with AI digital transformation, we often provide a range of data engineering support services, including data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data compliance, and master data management.
Our customers span a diverse range of industries and a wide range of AI use cases, benefiting from the short time-to-value and high economic returns our AI digital transformation solutions and platforms offer.
The document analytics market - a subset of the overall AI market - is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48.1% from 2020 to 2027, reaching $12.45 billion by 2027.5 Meanwhile, overall enterprise AI spend is projected to reach $53.06 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of 35.4% from 2019 to 2026.6
Industry AI Platforms
Our industry platforms address specific, niche market requirements that we believe we can fulfill in large part with our AI/ML technologies. We deploy these industry platforms as software-as-a-service (SaaS) and as managed services. To date, we have built an industry platform for medical records data extraction and transformation (which we brand as “Synodex®”) and an industry platform for public relations (which we brand as “Agility PR Solutions”).
Our Synodex industry platform transforms medical records into useable digital data organized in accordance with our proprietary data models or customer data models. At the end of 2021, we had 18 customers utilizing our Synodex platform, including John Hancock Insurance, the insurance operating unit of John Hancock Financial (a division of Manulife) and one of the largest life insurers in the United States. As we further integrate AI into the platform, we aim to address the needs of the healthcare sector, which is increasingly seeking to search, analyze, and interpret vast volumes of patient data, improve clinical documentation and make computer-assisted coding more efficient. The global artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare market is forecast to reach a market size of $67.4 billion by 2027, up from $6.9 billion in 2021, with a CAGR of 46.2%.7
Our Agility industry platform provides marketing communications and public relations professionals with the ability to target and distribute content to journalists and social media influencers world-wide and to monitor and analyze global news (print, web, radio and TV) and social media. Agility is now ranked by software review site G2 Crowd as meeting the requirements of customers better than its two largest competitors that have combined revenues of over $1 billion.8 Agility operates in the $4.8 billion media intelligence solutions market.9

Competitive Strengths
Our Data Quality
We believe we achieve industry-leading data quality by leveraging our technology, our large staff of human experts, and the culture we have cultivated over many years of providing high-quality data to the most demanding customers.
For the past six years, we have been designing and refining our approach for combining human experts and AI to produce large-scale, highly accurate data. In our approach, AI networks automatically perform much of the required processing and human experts perform processing that the AI cannot perform at a high level of confidence. The human output is fed back into the AI networks, which, as a result, “learn” and become “smarter” over time, achieving progressively greater levels of automation while maintaining the highest levels of quality. (See “Our Technology”, below.)
Our 4,000+ experts have deep domain knowledge in a wide diversity of data domains. They are selected on the basis of data acumen, analytical ability, and deep domain proficiency. (See “Our Domain Experts”, below.)
Our culture of quality is critical to achieving and sustaining high data quality. Our culture has been cultivated over our decades of experience performing data-related tasks for leading global companies, including the four largest global information companies with which we have 10-plus year relationships building and maintaining many of their leading data products.
We maintain independent quality assurance centers that comply with the ISO 9001:2008 quality management system standards.
Our Domain Experts
We have over 4,000 employees with deep data domain expertise in various fields, including law, sciences, health, finance, and technology. Many of them hold advanced degrees. They process data in over 25 languages. For annotating complex or sensitive data, our expert staff provides an attractive alternative to the crowdsourced labor pools utilized by many of our competitors typically for mundane tasks. They are especially well-suited for high-context data, such as legal contract classification, medical images, medical records, and scientific and legal literature.
Our Technology
Over the past five years, we have built a technology infrastructure that automates complex data annotation and other data engineering tasks. Our technology infrastructure combines advanced dataflow, deep learning (a branch of AI), and purpose-built applications used by human experts, which we refer to as “workbenches”. This infrastructure enables us to perform data annotation and other data engineering tasks at progressively higher levels of efficiency without compromising quality as it continuously learns from human experts.
Our proprietary, state-of-the-art Goldengate platform is our core AI technology stack. Goldengate accepts a wide range of documents – including images, PDFs, and web copy – and performs a series of cognitive tasks to extract intelligence and create analytical data that people can use for generating inferences and powering analytical applications. It serves up no-code AI with transfer learning built on generative language models we have developed over the past six years of deploying industrial deep neural networks. Goldengate serves as the foundational technology for the AI projects we perform for customers, as well as the AI-under-the-hood that powers our data annotation platform and our industry platforms. One of the main benefits of the platform is that it’s “no-code”, so it doesn’t require a large number of data scientists to build models or require a data science platform to orchestrate models and update models. Using Goldengate in combination with our SMEs, we are able to build high-performing, cutting-edge models that address real-world problems. In 2021 we further AI-enabled Synodex, Agility and our data annotation platform using Goldengate; in 2022, we intend to commercialize it further as both a customer-facing technology and as the engine under other potential industry solutions.
Goldengate functionality can be consumed as domain-specific and task-specific microservices each of which performs a discrete data-related task automatically. Each AI microservice may be invoked by the dataflow via a RESTful API. Many complex data problems can be solved with a combination of these microservices. Capabilities include deep sequence labelling, categorization, segmentation and sequence-to-sequence mapping. For each cognitive task an AI microservice performs, it provides a confidence score. A confidence score at or above an established accuracy threshold means no human expert review is required. A confidence score below an established accuracy threshold means human expert review is required. 
When expert review is required, the dataflow automatically routes data to an appropriate human expert. Our human experts use workbenches that enable them to quickly and efficiently review the data and make judgements. The workbenches then retroactively feed

back the expert-reviewed work into Goldengate’s deep neural network, enabling it to learn and become smarter. This feature is commonly known as “human-in-the-loop”. It results in continuous, predictable improvement and progressively greater levels of automation.
To support our Agility industry platform, we have built a fully scalable, cloud-based infrastructure that powers a SaaS experience for global customers on a 24/7 basis. It includes (i) an AI/ML-powered big data media intelligence platform that indexes two billion media items per year, powering media monitoring, media enrichment, and media database APIs; (ii) a full targeting workflow platform that integrates media targeting, content curation, content distribution, integrated newswires, and a newsroom; (iii) a comprehensive database of more than one million global media influencers and journalists; (iv) a media monitoring and analytics engine; and (v) a workflow platform for media database research combining AI and machine learning to streamline research workflows for discovery and maintenance of our database.
To support our Synodex industry platform, we have built technologies for transforming imaged medical records and HL7/FHIR electronic health records (EHR) systems into digital data conforming to proprietary insurance medical data dictionaries that span diseases and impairments, diagnostic tests, pharmacology and support industry standard codes such as ICD-10 as well as rules engines for processing, analyzing and displaying the digital data.
Our Infrastructure
Our infrastructure supports a range of strategies to suit our customers’ requirements for data security, compliance, scalability and reliability. Our user endpoints are secured with cloud-managed security solutions consisting of firewall, IDS/IPS, vulnerability scanning and patch management engines. We host data and applications in our own data centers at our operations centers, in our customers’ data centers, and on third-party cloud services that provide the benefit of “infinite scalability” of hardware resources. Our data operations are linked by multiple redundant network connections. Our Wide Area Network – along with our Local Area Networks, Storage Area Networks, Network Attached Storage and data centers – are configured with industry standard redundancy, often with more than one backup to establish 24x7 availability. In 2021, our Wide Area Network had 99.96% uptime excluding scheduled maintenance. We encrypt all sensitive information, both at rest and in transit, to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 or similar standard, and we employ a range of security features, including industry-leading managed firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention services. (See “Information Security”, below.)
Our Breath of Capabilities
We are able to address customers at their highest point of need. For example, we may provide data annotation for a data sciences team at a bank that is building an AI application to manage complex loan agreements. For another banking customer with the same requirement but without a sophisticated data sciences team, we might provide a full AI/ML solution built on our proprietary Goldengate AI platform that extracts key data points from the loan agreements and outputs normalized digital data via an API to the bank’s existing application. For still another banking customer that also lacked such an application, we might provide a data analytics platform.
Data science teams that utilize our data annotation services also often have other related needs that include data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data compliance, and master data management. Unlike many of our data annotation competitors – that are essentially staffing companies – as a full-service data engineering company we are able to address these attendant requirements.
Our Outcomes Orientation
We have developed a strong customer-centric culture and a set of values designed around achieving promised outcomes for our customers. This includes proactive communication, innovation, transparency, and empathy.
Growth Strategy
Our strategy for growth is to align to and serve large, dynamic and rapidly growing markets related to the deployment of AI/ML in businesses. Our solutions and platforms leverage the technology, human resources, and culture of fanaticism for data quality that we have developed over the past 30 years, as well as the AI/ML research and development we have invested in over the past six years.
We intend to invest significantly in scaling our sales and marketing. In 2021 we expanded our sales force by close to 400%, ending 2021 with a sales team of 115. We expect this will deliver significant returns in future years.

We also plan to continue to invest in our proprietary Goldengate AI/ML platform and in the continued development of new SaaS platforms as sources of competitive advantage. We have also invested in building a proprietary resource management platform geared specifically to managing remote staff and freelancers. Prior to the global pandemic, our operating model was to almost exclusively use full-time employees working from large production centers. Propelled by the need to shift to remote working, we are presently near 100% cloud-based and remote, which has enabled us to lower fixed operating costs and achieve greater scalability. 
We expect to fully fund these investments for growth from our internal resources without need for outside financing.
Our Customers
Our customers include leading businesses across multiple verticals including banking, insurance, financial services, technology, digital retailing and information/media. One customer in the DDS segment generated approximately 11% and 14% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, revenues from non-U.S. customers accounted for 45% and 54%, respectively, of the Company’s revenues.
We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers, and we have provided services to the customer referenced in the preceding paragraph for over ten years. Our track record of delivering high-quality services helps us to solidify customer relationships. Many of our customers are recurring customers, meaning that they have continued to provide additional projects to us after our initial engagement with them.
Our agreements with our customers are in many cases terminable on 30 to 90 days’ notice. A substantial portion of the services we provide to our customers is subject to their requirements.
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our solutions and platforms directly through our professional staff, senior management and direct sales personnel operating primarily from various locations in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Europe. In addition, we are increasingly developing and expanding our use of strategic partnerships and channel relationships for the establishment and development of new and existing customers.
In addition to our executive-level business development professionals and sales and marketing personnel, we also deploy solutions architects, technical support experts and consultants who support the development of new customers and new customer engagements. These resources work within teams (both permanent and ad hoc) that provide support to customers.
Our marketing department and sales professionals work together to generate leads. Our sales professionals identify and qualify prospects, securing direct personal access to decision makers at existing and prospective customers. They facilitate interactions between customer personnel and our service teams to define ways in which we can assist customers with their goals. For each prospective customer engagement, we assemble a team of our senior employees drawn from various disciplines within our Company. The team members assume assigned roles in a formalized process, using their combined knowledge and experience to understand the customer’s goals and collaborate with the customer on a solution.
Our marketing organization is responsible for developing and increasing the visibility and awareness of our brand and our service offerings, defining and communicating our value proposition, generating qualified, early-stage leads and furnishing effective sales support tools.
As part of our marketing strategy, we partner with media organizations to build awareness, establish a reputation as an industry thought leader and generate leads. Media partners include trade associations and publications, trade show producers and consulting organizations. These partnerships are particularly valuable in enterprise industries as we build our presence among digital content leaders and decision makers.
Primary marketing outreach activities include content marketing, event marketing (including exhibiting at trade shows, virtual summits, conferences and seminars), direct and database marketing, public and media relations (including speaking engagements), and web marketing (including integrated marketing campaigns, search engine optimization, search engine marketing and the maintenance and continued development of external websites).

Our Innodata Labs researches and develops AI-based technologies that we utilize in our operations and with our customers. The Innodata Labs team is comprised of data scientists, including data scientists who have published leading papers on discrete topics in data science and have earned PhD degrees in fields such as data entity extraction.
Environmental, Social, and Governance
We are values-driven company, committed to continuously improving how we perform as a steward of nature, manage relationships with our employees, suppliers, customers and communities, and conduct our business.
While we are driven by the vision of ushering in the promise of digital data and ubiquitous AI, we are cognizant that the disruption AI will inevitably cause will not be equitably distributed. Ironically, many of the communities in which we source human capital for AI projects – communities in India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka – are also more heavily dependent on manual labor and face greater potential disruption as a result of AI.
Therefore, as we set out on our AI journey six years ago, we made a concomitant commitment to do our part to help economically disadvantaged youth (especially young women) in these communities become technology-savvy. It was our aspiration that they become empowered beneficiaries of an AI-enabled world rather than its victims. 
From 2016 to 2021, our employees have contributed over 1,600 person days to our I-Hope program. I-Hope has built 14 fully-functional computer labs at schools across India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, and has donated over 110,000 books and other educational materials to schools and a public library. We believe these efforts stand to benefit approximately 70,000 students, teachers and the members of the general public. As a direct result of our work, we believe approximately 5,700 more children are now technology proficient and ready to take on challenges of navigating an increasingly AI-enabled world. In 2021, we were the proud recipients of the Corporate Excellence Awards in CSR Programs and Health, Safety, and Environment Programs 2020-2021 issued by Cebu IT-BTM Organization (CIB.O), and the DSWD Philippines (Department of Social Welfare & Development) Regional Citation Award.
Our goal is to technology-enable 24,000 children by 2025, and we will be devoting a portion of our revenue to this worthy goal.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 225 persons in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, and 4,706 persons in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Germany, and Israel, and we had 4,878 full-time employees. Many of our employees hold advanced degrees in specialized fields such as law, business, technology, medicine, and social sciences. No employees are currently represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
Corporate Offices
Our principal executive offices are located at 55 Challenger Road, Ridgefield Park, New Jersey 07660, just outside New York City, and our telephone number is (201) 371-8000. We were founded in 1988.
