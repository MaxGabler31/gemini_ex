Item 1. Business
Overview
Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. ("CBA") is the seventh largest craft brewing company in the U.S. and a leader in brewing, branding, and bringing to market world-class American craft beers.
Our distinctive portfolio combines the power of Kona Brewing Co., one of the top craft beer brands in the world, with strong regional breweries and innovative lifestyle brands, including Appalachian Mountain Brewery ("AMB"), Cisco Brewers, Omission Brewing Co., Redhook Brewery, Square Mile Cider Co., Widmer Brothers Brewing, and Wynwood Brewing Co. We nurture the growth and development of our brands in today’s increasingly competitive beer market through our state-of-the-art brewing and distribution capability, integrated sales and marketing infrastructure, and strong focus on innovation, local community and sustainability.
CBA was formed in 2008 through the merger of Redhook Brewery and Widmer Brothers Brewing, the two largest craft brewing pioneers in the Northwest at the time. Following a successful strategic brewing and distribution partnership, Kona Brewing Co. joined CBA in 2010. As part of CBA, Kona has expanded its reach across all 50 U.S. states and approximately 30 countries, while remaining deeply rooted in its home of Hawaii.
As consumers increasingly seek more variety and more local offerings, Craft Brew Alliance has expanded its portfolio and home markets with strong regional craft beer brands in targeted markets. In 2015 and 2016, we formed strategic partnerships with Appalachian Mountain Brewery, based in Boone, North Carolina; Cisco Brewers, based in Nantucket, Massachusetts; and Wynwood Brewing Co., based in the heart of Miami’s vibrant multicultural arts district. Building on the success of these partnerships, we acquired all three brands in the fourth quarter of 2018, fundamentally transforming our footprint and paving the way to increase our investments in their growth and drive shareholder value.
Publicly traded on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol BREW, Craft Brew Alliance is headquartered in Portland, Oregon and operates breweries and brewpubs across the U.S. For more information about CBA and its brands, see “Available Information” on page 14 of this report.
We proudly brew and package our craft beers in three company-owned production breweries located in Portland, Oregon; Portsmouth, New Hampshire; and Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. In 2018, we continued to leverage our contract brewing agreement with A-B Commercial Strategies, LLC (“ABCS”), an affiliate of Anheuser-Busch, LLC (“A-B”), through which we brew select CBA brands in A-B’s Fort Collins, Colorado brewery. Additionally, we own and operate five innovation breweries in Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Boone, North Carolina; and Miami, Florida, which are primarily used for small-batch production and limited-release beers offered primarily in our brewpubs and brands’ home markets.
We distribute our beers to retailers through wholesalers that are aligned with the A-B network. These sales are made pursuant to a Master Distributor Agreement (the “A-B Distributor Agreement”) with A-B, which extends through 2028. As a result of this

distribution arrangement, we believe that, under alcohol beverage laws in a majority of states, these wholesalers would own the exclusive right to distribute our beers in their respective markets if the A-B Distributor Agreement expires or is terminated. As competition puts increasing pressure on craft brands outside of their home markets, we are continuing our efforts to stabilize and strengthen Widmer Brothers and Redhook in the Pacific Northwest, while expanding distribution of Appalachian Mountain Brewery, Cisco Brewers, and Wynwood Brewing Co. across their respective home markets of North Carolina, New England, and South Miami.
Separate from our A-B wholesalers, we maintain an internal independent sales and marketing organization with resources across the key functions of brand management, field marketing, field sales, and national retail sales.
We operate in two segments: Beer Related operations and Brewpubs operations. Beer Related operations include the brewing, and domestic and international sales, of craft beers and ciders from our breweries. Brewpubs operations primarily include our seven brewpubs, six of which are located adjacent to our Beer Related operations, as well as other merchandise sales, and sales of our beers directly to customers.
Industry Background
We are one of the top seven brewers in the craft brewing segment of the U.S. brewing industry. The domestic beer market includes ales and lagers produced by large domestic brewers, international brewers and craft brewers. As the overall domestic market experienced a decrease in shipments of 1% in 2018, the craft beer segment began to show signs of a slowdown. Shipments of craft beer in the U.S. are estimated by industry sources to have decreased by only 0.6% in 2018 over 2017, compared to a 1.4% increase in 2017 over 2016. Of total beer shipped in the U.S., craft beer shipments were approximately 14.3% in 2018 and 14.2% in 2017. Approximately 29.0 million barrels and 29.2 million barrels, respectively, were shipped in the U.S. by the craft beer segment during 2018 and 2017, while total beer sold in the U.S., including imported beer, was 202.6 million barrels and 204.6 million barrels, respectively. Compared with the other segments of the U.S. brewing industry, craft brewing is a relative newcomer. Twenty years ago, Redhook and Widmer Brothers Brewery were two of the approximately 200 craft breweries in operation. By the end of 2018, the number of craft breweries in operation had grown to more than 7,000. Industry sources estimate that craft beer produced by regional and national craft brewers, similar to us, accounts for approximately two-thirds of total craft beer sales, with one-third of the production brewed by smaller craft breweries.
Our comprehensive portfolio and national scale provide a competitive advantage in today’s market environment, which includes craft brewers, domestic specialty beers, and imports. Our distinctive brand portfolio is positioned to address significant changes in consumer trends, including increased demand for innovative flavors and styles, a growing interest in sustainability, and the increasing importance of local relevance. As an example, Kona Brewing is one of the top craft brewers, with a broad portfolio of beers that reflect a uniquely Hawaii-inspired flavor profile, a recognized track record in sustainable business practices, and deep ties to its local community as Hawaii’s longest-running craft brewery.
Business Strategy 
At Craft Brew Alliance, we believe we have an advantaged strategy to sustain long-term growth in today’s increasingly complex beer market. 
The central elements of our business strategy include:

• | Increased focus on topline growth, driving our Kona Plus portfolio strategy, supporting our strong regional craft brands in their home markets, and unlocking the potential of Kona as a global lifestyle brand.


• | Building on healthy business fundamentals, including strong revenue management and improved supply chain execution to expand gross margin. 


• | Actualizing the future, through leveraging CBA’s enhanced partnership agreements with Anheuser-Busch to drive growth, value and cost savings, while continuing to explore potential new opportunities for innovation and to invest in our talent and culture.

Key Differentiators
Following are key differentiators that create competitive advantage for CBA in today’s rapidly evolving craft beer segment.

• | A distinctive portfolio of authentic craft beer brands anchored by Kona Brewing Co., which combines the power of one of the largest craft beer brands in the U.S with a strong stable of award-winning regional craft brands.


• | A transformational strategic relationship with Anheuser-Busch InBev, through which we have been able to gain access to the best route to market in the industry, optimize our brewery footprint, and support Kona’s global growth.

Index


• | A national brewing footprint that allows us to get our beers to market faster, fresher and more efficiently. We have significant flexibility to fully leverage the specific strengths of our distinct breweries and operations, as well as A-B's Fort Collins, Colorado brewery. Additionally, we guarantee the quality and consistency of all of our products through fine-tuned processes designed to ensure that everything, from brewing to quality-assurance to warehousing and distribution, meets our high standards. We believe that maximizing production under our direct supervision and through accomplished and expert partners is critical to our success. Further, we believe that our ability to engage in ongoing product innovation while controlling product quality provides critical competitive advantages. Each of our breweries is modern, has flexible production capabilities, and is designed to produce beer in smaller batches compared to the national domestic brewers, thereby allowing us to brew a wide variety of brand offerings. We believe that our investment in brewing and logistics technologies enables us to minimize brewery operating costs and consistently produce innovative beer styles.


• | Nationwide sales activation through robust partnerships with leading retailers. We leverage our national sales and marketing capabilities and complementary brand families to create a unique identity in the distribution channel and with the consumer.


• | National seamless distribution as an aligned brand within the Anheuser-Busch wholesaler network. This distribution footprint provides efficiencies in logistics and product delivery, state reporting and licensing, billing and collections. We have realized these efficiencies while maintaining full autonomy over the production, sale and marketing of our products as an independent craft beer company.


• | An experienced leadership team with expertise in the beer and beverage industries. The team has a proven ability to manage brand lifecycles, from development to turnaround, in both large and growth-company settings.


• | A commitment to innovation. In 2018, we launched the most comprehensive consumer research initiative in our company history, including pH, a quick test-and-learn product experiment, and two consumer-based studies with global consultancy Prophet and the Yale Center for Consumer Insights.

Strategic Partner Acquisitions
On October 10, 2018, we announced the acquisition of our three craft partner brands -- North Carolina-based Appalachian Mountain Brewery, Massachusetts-based Cisco Brewers, and Florida-based Wynwood Brewing Co. -- to begin unlocking the full potential of our expanded portfolio. The acquisitions build on our successful craft partnership strategy, launched in 2015. Over the past several years, the partnerships with AMB, Cisco, and Wynwood have bolstered CBA’s portfolio, anchored by Kona Brewing Co., with strong local brands and innovation breweries in key markets. Further, the partnerships helped propel CBA’s strategic brewery evolution by leveraging the production capability and location of the Portsmouth, New Hampshire brewery as CBA rebalanced its brewing footprint. 

• | Under the purchase agreement with AMB, CBA acquired the AMB brand, brewery, and pub. The transaction closed November 29, 2018.


• | Under the agreement between CBA and Cisco, which closed October 10, 2018, CBA acquired the intellectual property assets of Cisco relating to its malt beverage products. Cisco’s founders continue to own and operate the Cisco Brewers brewpub properties and retail merchandising, including the original brewery and grounds in Nantucket.


• | Under CBA’s agreement with Wynwood Brewing Co., which also closed October 10, 2018, CBA purchased the remaining 75.5 percent equity interest in the Miami-based brewery, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of CBA. Wynwood’s operations will continue under the leadership of Co-founders Luis and his father “Pops” Brignoni.

Collectively, the acquisitions represent a milestone in enabling CBA and its shareholders to fully participate in the value that the partners will bring as wholly owned CBA brands.
Brand Overview
Our portfolio includes national brands Kona Brewing Company and Omission Brewing, as well as regional craft brands Appalachian Mountain Brewery, Cisco Brewers, Redhook Brewery, Square Mile Cider Company, Widmer Brothers Brewing, and Wynwood Brewing Co. with deep community roots.
We produce a variety of specialty craft beers and ciders using traditional brewing methods complemented by American innovation and invention. We brew our beers using high-quality hops, malted barley, wheat, rye and other natural traditional and nontraditional ingredients. To craft our ciders, we use three apple varieties from the Pacific Northwest and then use a lager beer yeast to make a unique and easy-to-drink hard cider.

Below is an overview of our eight owned brands:
Kona Brewing Company
Kona Brewing Company was started in Kailua-Kona on the Island of Hawaii in the spring of 1994 by father and son team Cameron Healy and Spoon Khalsa, who had a dream to create fresh, local island brews made with spirit, passion and quality.
Today, Kona is Hawaii’s largest and favorite craft brewery, known for top-selling flagship beers Big Wave Golden Ale and Longboard Island Lager and award-winning innovative small-batch beers available across the islands. The Hawaii born and Hawaii-based craft brewery prides itself on brewing the freshest beer of exceptional quality closest to market. This helps to minimize its carbon footprint by reducing shipping of raw materials, finished beer and packaging materials. In 2019, Kona will open a new 100,000-barrel solar and battery-powered brewery in Kailua-Kona, which will allow Kona to brew more beer on the islands and meet increasing demand in its home state,while saving precious natural resources.
Kona Brewing Company has become one of the top craft beer brands in the world, while remaining steadfastly committed to its home market through a strong focus on innovation, sustainability and community outreach.
Omission Beer
Founded in 2012, Omission Brewing Co. is the first craft beer brand in the U.S. focused exclusively on brewing great-tasting beers with traditional beer ingredients, including malted barley, that are specially crafted to remove gluten. Each batch of Omission Beer is tested independently using the R5 competitive ELISA test to ensure that it contains gluten levels below the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) gluten-free standard of 20ppm or less. Omission’s line up of beers is the most awarded within the gluten reduced segment, and includes Omission Lager, Omission Pale Ale, Omission IPA, and Omission Ultimate Light Golden Ale, a full-flavored gluten-reduced ale with only 99 calories and 5 carbs, released in 2017.
Appalachian Mountain Brewery
Nestled in the High Country of North Carolina, Appalachian Mountain Brewery is Boone, NC’s beer pioneer. The brewery is dedicated to making seriously delicious craft beer while focusing its business model on community, sustainability and philanthropy. Through its beers, AMB supports a variety of non-profits that are dedicated to enriching the land, water, air and people of the High Country. Appalachian Mountain Brewery has earned numerous awards for its innovative craft beers and ciders, including Boone Creek Blonde Ale, which won a Gold Medal at the 2015 U.S. Open Beer Championships and a Gold Medal at the 2017 Great American Beer Festival Competition, as well as Not a Double IPA, which won a Silver Medal at the 2018 Great American Beer Festival. The brewery’s core portfolio also includes Long Leaf IPA, Spoaty Oaty Pale Ale, and Porter, which was a gold medal winner at the 2015 Great International Beer and Cider Competition.
Cisco Brewers
Located near Cisco Beach on the island of Nantucket, Cisco Brewers is Nantucket’s first craft brewery. Founded by hard-working, entrepreneurial islanders who began selling beer from their outdoor brewery in 1995, Cisco has carved out its own special place on Nantucket where they tough out the winters to celebrate the summers. Over the years they’ve attracted a cult following with visitors to the island and open the door to anyone willing to make the trek. Named a top travel destination by Time Magazine, Huffington Post, Travel & Leisure and Men's Journal, Cisco’s brewery is a common ground where people from all walks of life connect over classic and approachable craft beers like Whale’s Tale Pale Ale, Grey Lady Ale, Sankaty Light Lager, and most recently, Gripah IPA. In addition to its Nantucket location, Cisco operates a brewpub in Portsmouth, New Hampshire and opens seasonal pop-up pubs in New England.
Redhook Brewery
Redhook was born out of the entrepreneurial spirit of the early 1980s in the heart of Seattle. While the term didn’t exist at the time, Redhook became one of America’s first craft breweries with its focus on creating a better beer. From a modest start in a former transmission shop in the Seattle neighborhood of Ballard, to a Fremont trolley barn that housed The Trolleyman brewpub, to its current brewery in Seattle, Washington, Redhook continues its passion for brewing innovative beers that stand apart in today’s crowded craft beer marketplace.
Redhook opened Brewlab, an experimental 10-barrel brewery and pub, in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle in 2017.
Redhook’s beer lineup includes Big Ballard IPA, Bicoastal IPA, ESB, Long Hammer IPA and a variety of seasonal beers, including My Oh My Caramel Macchiato Milk Stout, Tangelic Halo Tangerine IPA, Winterhook, and more.
Square Mile Cider Company
Launched in 2013, Square Mile Cider is the hard cider for the modern-day pioneers celebrating the spirit of the Pacific Northwest. We set out to reinvigorate an enduringly classic American beverage with a blend of hand-selected apples combined with unique

Northwest ingredients. Square Mile Cider produces three varieties of hard cider: Original Apple Cider, Hopped Apple Cider, and Rosé Apple Cider, which debuted in 2017 as one of the first rosé ciders in the market.
Widmer Brothers Brewing
Widmer Brothers Brewing was founded in 1984 in Portland, Oregon. Brothers Kurt and Rob Widmer, with help from their father, Ray, helped lead the Pacific Northwest craft beer movement when they began brewing unique interpretations of traditional German beer styles. In 1986, Widmer Brothers Brewing introduced the original American-style Hefeweizen, which elevated the brewery to national acclaim. Since then, Hefe has grown to become Oregon’s favorite craft beer and the brewery has continued to push the boundaries, developing beers with an unapologetic, uncompromised commitment to innovation.
Widmer Brothers currently brews a variety of award-winning beers. Its flagship Hefe, has won more than 30 medals, including nine from the Great American Beer Festival. The brewery’s other beers include Upheaval IPA, Drop Top Amber Ale, and a full seasonal lineup.
Wynwood Brewing Company
Wynwood Brewing Company is Miami’s first craft production brewery. Founded by Luis Brignoni and his father Luis “Pops” Brignoni Sr., Wynwood is deeply rooted in its founders’ Puerto Rican heritage and the brewery’s namesake neighborhood, the vibrant Wynwood Arts District. Wynwood Brewing Co. operates a 15-barrel brewhouse and taproom in the heart of the Wynwood Art District and distributes a variety of year-round, seasonal and limited beer offerings throughout South Florida, including flagship La Rubia Blonde Ale, Laces IPA, and Pop’s Porter, which earned a Gold Medal at the 2014 Great American Beer Festival.
Developments in Brands and Packaging 
Our recent brand and packaging developments include:
Kona Brewing
In 2018, Kona Brewing Co. expanded its portfolio with two new national brands, Kanaha Blonde Ale, a refreshing ale made with real mango fruit, and Gold Cliff IPA, a bold, hoppy IPA with tropical pineapple. Building on increasing consumer trends around living an active lifestyle, Kanaha Blonde Ale is only 99 calories, 4 carbs, and 4.2% ABV.
As with all of Kona’s beers, Kanaha Blonde Ale and Gold Cliff IPA were named for real locations and experiences in Hawaii. The low-calorie and refreshing Kanaha was named for the popular kite-surfing beaches of Kanaha on the North Shore of Maui. And the bold, juicy 7.2% ABV Gold Cliff IPA pays homage to the southern tip of Lanai, where the island’s first pineapple field sits atop cliffs that overlook cobalt blue waters. 2018 represented another year of robust growth for Kona, which grew volumes by 7%, exceeding the growth rate for the overall craft category. Kona’s growth was primarily led by flagship Big Wave, which grew depletions by 8% over 2017, and Longboard Lager, with distribution across all 50 states and approximately 30 international markets. In response to continued demand for its flagships in its home market, Kona also released Big Wave Golden Ale and Longboard Lager in new 18-packs of 12oz cans in Hawaii.
Omission Brewing Co.
Omission Brewing Co. remains the market leader in the gluten-removed beer category. In 2018, Omission expanded distribution of its newest national brand, Omission Ultimate Light, a refreshing 5-carb, 99-calorie gluten removed golden ale. Ultimate Light joins Omission’s national portfolio which includes Omission IPA, Omission Lager, and Omission Pale Ale - which earned a Silver Medal at the 2018 Great American Beer Festival. In 2018, Omission continued to expand distribution of Ultimate Light in 12oz cans in four U.S markets, Austin, Boston, Denver, and Phoenix.
Widmer Brothers Brewing
In 2018, Widmer Brothers continued to focus on the brewery’s flagship Hefe, which is the best-selling craft beer in Oregon. The brewery celebrated Hefe Day in May 2018 with a celebration at the taproom and adjacent beer garden featuring $0.86 Hefe specials. In December 2018, Widmer Brothers launched co-branded Portland Trail Blazers 16oz. Hefe cans, building on the longest-running craft beer partnership in the NBA and further supporting their award-winning flagship, which picked up its ninth medal from the Great American Beer Festival Competition in 2018.
Widmer Brothers added fan favorites Deadlift Imperial IPA and Green & Gold Kolsch to their 2018 seasonal lineup. Deadlift Imperial IPA, a bold double IPA that packs a flavorful hop punch and a smooth finish, was originally brewed in 2010 under a different name. The beer released in 6-packs, 12-packs, and draft as the spring seasonal and transitioned to a year-round offering in the fall. Green & Gold Kolsch, a crisp, golden-colored beer with aromas of strawberry and cracked black pepper, released in April 2018 as Widmer Brothers’ summer seasonal.

As a tribute to the neighborhood and city that has supported the brewery for over 30 years, Widmer Brothers introduced the Portland Pub Series Variety Pack, featuring beers that originated in the 10-barrel innovation brewery, including Russell Street IPA, PDX Pils, Steel Bridge Porter, and Hefe X, a rotating series featuring the brewery’s flagship Hefe with additions of different hop varietals. Widmer Brothers also launched several small-batch cans and bottles from the innovation brewery throughout the year, including Closing Time IPA, brewed in collaboration with rideshare company Lyft, which included a unique code to receive a ride discount. The brewery also released Le Petit Brasseur, one of the first craft beers bottled in reusable 500ml bottles in partnership with Oregon Bottle Drop.
Redhook Brewery
In 2018, Redhook bolstered its year-round portfolio, which includes Big Ballard Imperial IPA, Long Hammer IPA, ESB, and Bicoastal IPA, adding four new beers to its seasonal and Brewlab Limited Release Series lineups. My Oh My Caramel Macchiato Milk Stout, a rich, espresso-driven milk stout brewed with coffee and dark malts, released in January as a spring seasonal, and Tangelic Halo IPA, a tangerine IPA packed with naturally citrusy hops, debuted in May as the summer seasonal.
Building on the success of the Brewlab Limited Release Series in 2017, in 2018 Redhook released two new Limited Release beers based on recipes first brewed on Brewlab’s innovation brewery: Peaches for Me IPA and Continuous Revelation Coffee IPA. Loaded with juicy peach and mango and amplified by a trio of hops, Peaches for Me IPA was released in 6-pack bottles and draft. Continuous Revelation Coffee IPA brings together two Pacific Northwest staples: great beer and great coffee, and the coffee-laced IPA hit shelves in 6-packs in the latter half of 2018. Both limited release brews, as well as Tangelic Halo IPA, were also included in seasonal Hoppy Hook Pack variety packs.
Redhook Brewlab, Redhook’s innovation brewery and pub in the vibrant Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, celebrated its one-year anniversary in August 2018, and was honored to be voted Best Brewery, Best Bar, and Best Happy Hour in Seattle Weekly’s 2018 Best Of issue.
Square Mile Cider Company
In 2018, Square Mile Cider Company added Rosé Apple Cider to its year-round lineup. First released in 2017 as a seasonal offering, Rosé Apple Cider is a dry apple cider made with rose hips and hibiscus for a rosé flavor and pink hue. Square Mile Cider Company, which finds its inspiration from the pioneering spirit of the original Oregon pioneers, continued to focus on distribution in 12 states with their three ciders: Original Apple Cider, a classic American hard cider; Hopped Apple Cider, a hopped version of the classic American hard cider, with the addition of Citra and Galaxy hops; and Rosé Apple Cider.
Brewing Operations
Brewing Facilities
We use highly automated brewing equipment at our owned production breweries and innovation breweries. As of December 31, 2018, our total owned production capacity was 855,000 barrels. Our breweries include:

• | Oregon Brewery. Our Oregon Brewery is our largest capacity production brewery, which has an annual capacity of 630,000 barrels. In 2018, we completed the installation of a new canning line, which will enable us to produce a variety of can sizes - such as 12oz, 16oz and 19.2oz - to meet consumer demand. The brewery utilizes a CO2 recovery system to capture and repurpose CO2 naturally produced during the brewing process, eliminating the need to purchase and transport CO2, thus further supporting our focus on sustainability.


• | New Hampshire Brewery. Our New Hampshire Brewery utilizes a 100-barrel brewing system, with an annual capacity of 215,000 barrels, and uses an anaerobic waste-water treatment facility with power co-generation that completes the process cycle.


• | Hawaii Brewery. Our current Hawaii Brewery utilizes a 25-barrel brewing system, with an annual capacity of 10,000 barrels, and a 229-kilowatt photovoltaic solar energy generating system to supply approximately 50 percent of its energy requirements through renewable energy. In 2018, we continued to make progress on construction of a new 100,000-barrel brewery located steps away from our existing brewery and pub in Kona. The new brewery, which is being built with best-in-class sustainability and innovation, is scheduled to go online in the latter half of 2019.


• | Innovation Breweries. In 2018, we continued to leverage a 10-barrel small-batch innovation brewery built for Redhook in Seattle. The heart of the new brewery is a High Efficiency Brewing System that uses a mash filter press, allowing us to use significantly less water and energy than a typical brewery. The brewery’s flexibility enables Redhook to produce hundreds of different beer recipes that can be tested in the pub and scaled for larger production based on popularity. Our Portland 10-barrel innovation brewery and New Hampshire 3-barrel innovation brewery - as well as our newly acquired 10-barrel brewery in North Carolina and 15-barrel brewery in Florida, continued to focus on producing small batch beers for the local markets.

Index

In addition to our owned brewing capacity, we continued to produce CBA beers in A-B’s Fort Collins, Colo. brewery as part of a brewing agreement with ABCS. This partnership, which began in 2016, allows us to produce up to 300,000 barrels at this location annually.
Packaging
We package our craft beers in cans, bottles and kegs. All of our production breweries, with the exception of the Hawaii Brewery, have fully automated bottling and keg lines, and our Portsmouth and Portland breweries both have canning capability. The bottle fillers at all of the breweries utilize a carbon dioxide environment during bottling, ensuring that minimal oxygen is dissolved in the beer and extending the beer’s shelf life. We offer an assortment of packages to highlight the unique characteristics of each of our beers and to provide greater opportunities for customers to drink our beers in more locations and at more events and occasions, matching the active lifestyles and preferences of our consumers. Additionally, in our Hawaii brewpub and Seattle brewpub, we package our small-batch and innovation beers for consumers in crowlers.
Quality Control
We monitor production and quality control at all of our breweries, with central coordination at the Oregon Brewery. All of the production breweries have an on-site laboratory where microbiologists and lab technicians supervise on-site yeast propagation, monitor product quality, test products, measure color and bitterness, and test for oxidation and unwanted bacteria. We also regularly utilize outside laboratories for independent product analysis. In addition, every batch of beer that we produce goes through an internal taste panel to ensure that it meets our taste and profile standards.
Ingredients and Raw Materials
We currently purchase a significant portion of our malted barley from two suppliers and our premium-quality select hops, mostly grown in the Pacific Northwest, from competitive sources. We also periodically purchase small lots of hops from international sources, such as New Zealand and Western Europe, which we use to achieve a special hop character in certain beers. In order to ensure the supply of the hop varieties used in our products, we enter into supply contracts for our hop requirements. We believe that comparable quality malted barley and hops are available from alternate sources at competitive prices, although there can be no assurance that pricing would be consistent with our current arrangements. We currently cultivate our own yeast supply for certain strains and maintain a separate, secure supply in-house. We have access to multiple competitive sources for packaging materials, such as labels, six-pack carriers, crowns, cans and shipping cases.
Contract Brewing
In an effort to absorb excess capacity, we enter into contract brewing arrangements under which we produce beer in volumes and per specifications as designated by the arrangements.
During 2018, we shipped 28,200 barrels under contract brewing arrangements, compared to 17,700 barrels in 2017 and 26,700 in 2016.
Innovation
In 2018, we launched a comprehensive consumer research effort, beginning with the pH Experiment, a test-and-learn initiative that enabled us to quickly gather insights around consumer taste preferences and consumption trends. Additionally, we embarked on two consumer research projects with global consultancy Prophet and the Yale Center for Customer Insights to help understand new segmentation strategies. Combined with the ongoing learnings from our innovation breweries in Boone, Kailua-Kona, Miami, Portland, Portsmouth, and Seattle, these initiatives will broaden our view of today’s changing consumer landscape and inform the evolution of our business model and portfolio in 2019 and beyond.
Brewpubs Operations
We own and operate brew-pub restaurants and retail stores in our brewery home markets that support consumer awareness and research and development. In the fourth quarter of 2018, as part of the acquisition of our strategic partners, we added the AMB brewpub in Boone, NC and the Wynwood Brewing Co. brewpub in Miami, Florida, expanding our total brewpubs to seven. Our brewpub restaurants allow us to interact directly with over 1.5 million consumers annually in our home markets, which support brand awareness and trial. Our brewers are continually experimenting with different varieties of hops and malts in all styles of beer, and our brewpubs allow us to bring those beers to market in test-size batches in order to evaluate their potential prior to releasing them on a wider basis.

Distribution
With limited exceptions, all brewers in the United States are required to sell their beers to independent wholesalers, who then sell the beers to retailers. We are the only independent craft brewer in the U.S. to have established a wholly aligned distribution network through our partnership with A-B. This partnership provides us national distribution, which results in both an effective distribution presence in each market and administrative efficiencies. Our beers are available for sale directly to consumers in draft, cans and bottles at restaurants, bars and liquor stores, as well as in cans and bottles at supermarkets, warehouse clubs, convenience stores and drug stores. We sell beer directly to consumers at our brewpubs and breweries.
We distribute in all 50 states, pursuant to a master distributor agreement with A-B that allows us access to A-B’s national distribution network. For additional information regarding our relationship with A-B, see “Relationship with Anheuser-Busch, LLC” below. Management believes that our competitors in the craft beer segment generally negotiate distribution relationships separately with wholesalers in each locality and, as a result, typically distribute through a variety of wholesalers representing differing national beer brands with uncoordinated territorial boundaries.
In 2018 and 2017, we sold approximately 653,300 barrels and 654,200 barrels, respectively, to the wholesalers in A-B’s distribution network, accounting for 87.4% of our shipment volume for the 2018 and 2017 periods.
Sales and Marketing
In addition to leveraging our owned brewpubs and retail locations, we promote our products through a national sales and marketing network that includes, but is not limited to, i) creating and executing a range of advertising programs; ii) training and educating wholesalers and retailers about our products; and iii) promoting our name, product offerings, brands, and experimental beers at local festivals, venues and brewpubs.
We advertise and promote our products through an assortment of media, including television, radio, billboard, print, digital and social media, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, in key markets and by participating in cooperative programs with our wholesalers. We believe that the financial commitment by the distributor helps align the distributor’s interests with ours, and the distributor’s knowledge of the local market results in an advertising and promotion program that is targeted in a manner that will best promote our products.
Our breweries also play a significant role in increasing consumer awareness of our products and enhancing our image as a craft brewer. Thousands of visitors take tours at our breweries each year and all of our production breweries have a retail restaurant or pub where our products are served. In addition, several of the breweries have meeting space that the public can rent for business meetings, parties and holiday events, and that we use to entertain and educate wholesalers, retailers and the media about our products. At our brewpubs, we sell various items of apparel and other merchandise bearing our trademarks, which creates further awareness of our beers and brands. To further promote retail canned and bottled product sales, and in response to local competitive conditions, we regularly recommend that wholesalers offer discounts to retailers in most of our markets.
Relationship with Anheuser-Busch, LLC
As a significant element of our business operations, we have entered into various contractual relationships with A-B as described in more detail below. With regard to agreements with A-B or one of its affiliates that provide for the payment of fees or other compensation in exchange for products or services, due to the related party nature of the agreements, the contract pricing may not be commensurate with amounts that an independent market participant would pay.
Distributor Agreement
The Master A-B Distributor Agreement (the "A-B Distributor Agreement"), as amended in August 2016, provides for the distribution of our brands in all states, territories and possessions of the United States, including the District of Columbia and, except with respect to Kona beers, all U.S. military, diplomatic, and governmental installations in a U.S. territory or possession. Under the A-B Distributor Agreement, we have granted A-B the right of first refusal to distribute our products, including any internally developed new products, but excluding new products that we may acquire. We are responsible for marketing our products to A-B’s wholesalers, as well as to retailers and consumers.
As amended in August 2016, the term of the A-B Distributor Agreement will expire on December 31, 2028. The A-B Distributor Agreement is also subject to immediate termination, by either party, upon the occurrence of standard events of default as defined in the agreement. Additionally, the A-B Distributor Agreement may be terminated by A-B, with six months’ prior written notice to us, upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

Index


• | we engage in incompatible conduct that damages the reputation or image of A‑B or the brewing industry;


• | any A-B competitor or affiliate thereof acquires 10% or more of our outstanding equity securities, and that entity designates one or more persons to our board of directors;


• | our current chief executive officer ceases to function in that role or is terminated, and a satisfactory successor, in A‑B’s opinion, is not appointed within six months;


• | we are merged or consolidated into or with any other entity or any other entity merges or consolidates into or with us without A-B’s prior approval; or


• | A-B, its subsidiaries, affiliates, or parent, incur any obligation or expense as a result of a claim asserted against them by or in our name, or by our affiliates or shareholders, and we do not reimburse and indemnify A-B and its corporate affiliates on demand for the entire amount of the obligation or expense.

A-B also has the right to deliver a revocation notice and reinstitute the terms of the A-B Distributor Agreement as they existed prior to August 23, 2016, following a “change of control event” that occurs or for which a definitive agreement is entered into prior to August 23, 2019, and is subsequently completed. A “change of control event” includes, with certain exceptions, (i) the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial ownership on a fully diluted basis of 50% or more of our equity securities (or the equity securities of the surviving entity in any merger, consolidation, share exchange or other business combination involving us), (ii) a change in the composition of our board of directors during any consecutive 12-month period such that the incumbent directors cease to constitute at least a majority of the board of directors, or (iii) the completion of a sale, lease, exchange, or other transfer of (A) the Kona brand or (B) 50% or more of our assets based on fair market value.
A-B would have a similar revocation right at any time following the earliest to occur of (x) our rejection of a “qualifying offer” by A-B, (y) the completion of a transaction implementing A-B’s qualifying offer, and (z) our failure to enter into a definitive transaction agreement with A-B within 120 days following receipt of A-B’s qualifying offer, with certain exceptions. A “qualifying offer” means an offer or proposal on customary terms and conditions, with certain exceptions, made by A-B (or one of its affiliates) for the acquisition of all of our outstanding common stock not owned by A-B or its affiliates, for a specified aggregate value (subject to adjustment for changes in capitalization). From and after August 24, 2018, the specified value for a qualifying offer must be at least $24.50 per share.
Under the A-B Distributor Agreement, we pay $0.25 per case-equivalent as a margin fee. Beginning on January 1, 2019, we will reinvest an aggregate amount equal to $0.25 per case-equivalent in sales and marketing efforts for our products. If A-B were to exercise its revocation right described above, the margin fee payable under the A-B Distribution Agreement would revert to $0.75 per case-equivalent.
International Distribution Agreement
On August 23, 2016, we also entered into an International Distribution Agreement (the “International Distribution Agreement”) with Anheuser-Busch Worldwide Investments, LLC (“ABWI”), an affiliate of A-B, pursuant to which ABWI will be the sole and exclusive distributor of our malt beverage products in jurisdictions outside the United States, subject to the terms and conditions of our agreement with our existing international distributor, CraftCan Travel LLC, and certain other limitations, in each case as set forth in the International Distribution Agreement. Under the International Distribution Agreement, following delivery of notice to us, ABWI may also elect to commence brewing outside of the United States some or all of the products to be distributed in the non-U.S. jurisdictions covered by the International Distribution Agreement. 
Under the terms of the International Distribution Agreement, with respect to our exported products produced by us, ABWI will pay us our costs of production plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses relating to export shipment costs. Additionally, ABWI will pay us an international royalty fee based on volume of our products sold by ABWI, equal to either $40 per barrel or $30 per barrel, depending on certain factors described in the International Distribution Agreement, which royalty fee will be subject to escalation annually, beginning in calendar year 2018, on the terms described in the International Distribution Agreement. In addition, for calendar years 2016, 2017 and 2018, ABWI has paid us one-time fees of $3.0 million, $5.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively. The sum of the fees is recognized in Beer Related Net sales on a straight-line basis over the 10-year contract term, while the fees are collected in the first quarter of the year following the applicable calendar year.
The International Distribution Agreement contains specified termination rights, including, among other things, the right of either party to terminate the International Distribution Agreement if (a) the other party fails to perform any material obligation under the International Distribution Agreement, subject to certain cure rights or (b) the Brewing Agreement (as defined below) is terminated pursuant to certain specified provisions thereof. In addition, ABWI has the right to terminate the International Distribution Agreement upon 90 days’ prior written notice to us following (i) a “change of control event” (as defined above) that occurs or for which a definitive agreement is entered into prior to August 23, 2019, and is subsequently completed, or (ii) the earliest of (x) our rejection of a “qualifying offer” (as defined above), (y) the completion of a transaction implementing a qualifying offer, and (z) our failure to enter into a definitive transaction agreement within 120 days following receipt of a qualifying offer, with certain

exceptions (each of the foregoing subclauses (x) through (z), a “qualifying offer lapse”). Following termination of the International Distribution Agreement due to a qualifying offer lapse, or any change of control event, ABWI shall have the right to purchase the international distribution rights for each of our brands then being distributed under the International Distribution Agreement at the fair market value of such rights, and on otherwise customary terms and conditions, as set forth in the International Distribution Agreement.
Under the International Distribution Agreement, ABWI will also be required to make a one-time $20.0 million payment to us on August 23, 2019. The payment is being recognized in Beer Related Net sales on a straight-line basis over the 10-year contract term. However, ABWI will not (subject to compliance with certain notice requirements) be obligated to make such one-time payment if, prior to that date, (i) a “change of control event” occurs or a definitive agreement for a transaction constituting a change of control event is entered into, (ii) ABWI (or an affiliate thereof) makes a qualifying offer and there is a qualifying offer lapse or (iii) we enter into a definitive agreement with ABWI (or an affiliate thereof) with respect to a qualifying offer but such agreement is subsequently terminated, other than for certain regulatory reasons (in which case the $20.0 million shall remain payable). Unless terminated sooner, the International Distribution Agreement will continue in effect until December 31, 2026.
Contract Brewing Arrangements
On August 23, 2016, we entered into a Contract Brewing Agreement (the “Brewing Agreement”) with A-B Commercial Strategies, LLC (“ABCS”), an affiliate of A-B, pursuant to which ABCS will brew, bottle and package up to 300,000 barrels of our mutually agreed products annually, in facilities owned by ABCS within the United States, for an initial term through December 31, 2026. Production of CBA's products in ABCS’s brewery in Fort Collins, Colorado, began in the second quarter of 2017. We share equally with ABCS in any cost savings arising from the Brewing Agreement, provided that our cost savings will equal at least $10.00 per barrel on an aggregate basis, following certain adjustments as set forth in the Brewing Agreement. The Brewing Agreement provides specified termination rights, including, among other things, the right of either party to terminate the Brewing Agreement if (i) the other party fails to perform any material obligation under the Brewing Agreement, subject to certain cure rights, (ii) the International Distribution Agreement (as defined above) is terminated pursuant to certain specified provisions thereof, or (iii) subject to certain conditions, if the A-B Distributor Agreement (as defined above) is terminated pursuant to certain specified provisions thereof.
In addition, ABCS has the right to terminate the Brewing Agreement, upon 90 days’ prior written notice to us, following (i) a change of control event (as defined above) that occurs or for which a definitive agreement is entered into prior to August 23, 2019, and is subsequently completed, or (ii) the earliest to occur of (x) our rejection of a “qualifying offer” (as defined above), (y) the completion of a transaction implementing a qualifying offer, and (z) our failure to enter into a definitive transaction agreement within 120 days following receipt of a qualifying offer, with certain exceptions.
On January 30, 2018, we also entered into a Contract Brewing Agreement with Anheuser-Busch Companies, LLC (“ABC”), another A-B affiliate, pursuant to which we agreed to brew, package, and palletize certain malt beverage products of A-B's craft breweries at our Portland, Oregon, and Portsmouth, New Hampshire breweries, as selected by ABC. Under the terms of this agreement, ABC pays us a per barrel fee that varies based on the annual volume of the specified product brewed by us, plus (a) our actual incremental costs of brewing the product, and (b) certain capital costs and costs of graphics and labeling that we incur in connection with the brewed products. The agreement, as extended, will expire on December 31, 2019, unless further extended by mutual agreement. The agreement also contains specified termination rights, including, among other things, the right of either party to terminate it if (i) the other party fails to perform any material obligation under the agreement or any other agreement between the parties, subject to certain cure rights, or (ii) the A-B Distributor Agreement is terminated.
Exchange Agreement
We have also entered into an Amended and Restated Exchange and Recapitalization Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with A-B, pursuant to which we have granted A-B certain contractual rights. The Exchange Agreement originally was entered into in 2004 as part of a recapitalization in which we redeemed preferred shares held by A-B in exchange for cash and the shares of our common stock currently held by A-B. A-B owned 6,069,047, or approximately 31.3%, of our outstanding shares of common stock at December 31, 2018.

The Exchange Agreement entitles A-B to designate two members of our board of directors. A-B also generally has the right to have a designee on each committee of the board of directors, except where prohibited by law or stock exchange requirements, or with respect to a committee formed to evaluate transactions or proposed transactions between A-B and us. The Exchange Agreement contains limitations on our ability to take certain actions without A-B’s prior consent, including, but not limited to, our ability to issue equity securities or acquire or sell assets or stock, amend our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, grant board representation rights, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, distribute our products in the United States other than through A-B or as provided in the A-B Distributor Agreement, or voluntarily terminate our listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
On August 23, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the Exchange Agreement with A-B providing it with rights, following a “change of control event” or a “qualifying offer,” similar to those described above under “Amendment to A-B Distributor Agreement.”
Fees
We pay fees to A-B in connection with the sale of our products, including margin fees, invoicing, staging and cooperage handling fees, and inventory manager fees. In addition, our contract brewing arrangements call for the payment of fees to the respective brewing partner, and A-B pays us distribution costs and fees and royalty fees under the International Distribution Agreement.
See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.
Seasonality
Our sales generally reflect a degree of seasonality, with the first and fourth quarters historically exhibiting low sales levels compared to the second and third quarters. Accordingly, our results for any particular quarter are not likely to be indicative of the results to be achieved for the full year.
Competition
We compete in the craft brewing market, as well as in the much larger alcoholic beverage market, which encompasses domestic and imported beers, flavored alcohol beverages, spirits, wine and ciders. Increasingly, we are also monitoring the impact of marijuana as more states pass legalization.
In 2018, the craft brewing industry continued to experience unprecedented change and competition, characterized by three trends: 1) the growing number and popularity of new local craft breweries that captured market share from established craft breweries; 2) continued acquisition and investment activity between craft brewers, large domestic and foreign brewers, and private equity firms; and 3) continued competitive pressure from international brewers, such as Crown, which target both domestic and craft beer drinkers. In 2018, according to industry sources, A-B and MillerCoors accounted for almost 80% of total beer shipped in the U.S., excluding imports. In addition, A-B and MillerCoors continued to invest in smaller craft breweries and nurtured separate craft-focused divisions in an effort to capitalize on the growing craft beer segment and consumer demand for locally produced products.
Competition varies by regional market. Depending on the local market preferences and distribution, we have encountered strong competition from microbreweries, regional specialty brewers and several national craft brewers that include MillerCoors’ Tenth and Blake Beer Company division (“Tenth and Blake”), Constellation Brands, and A-B’s craft division. A-B’s craft division includes Goose Island, Blue Point Brewing, 10 Barrel Brewing Company, Elysian, Golden Road, Shock Top, Karbach Brewing, Devil's Backbone and others. Because of the large number of participants and offerings in this segment, along with the accelerating consumer preference for local offerings, the competition for packaged product placements and especially draft beer placements has intensified. Although certain of these competitors distribute their products nationally and may have greater financial and other resources than we have, we believe that we possess certain competitive advantages. Our unique portfolio strategy combines strong national lifestyle brands with distinctive regional craft brands, supported by the scale and specialization of our production breweries, strategically distributed sales and marketing resources, and alignment within the A-B distribution network.
We also compete against imported brands, such as Heineken, Stella Artois, Corona Extra and Guinness, which typically have significantly greater financial resources than we have. Although imported beers currently account for a greater share of the U.S. beer market than craft beers, we believe that craft brewers possess certain competitive advantages over some importers, including lower transportation costs, no importation costs, proximity to and familiarity with local consumers, a higher degree of product freshness, eligibility for lower federal excise taxes and absence of exposure to currency fluctuations.
In response to the growth of the craft beer segment, the major domestic national brewers have invested in purchasing small craft breweries. The major national brewers, including Tenth and Blake through MillerCoors, and A-B craft brands through A-B, have 
12

Index

significantly greater financial resources than we do and have access to a greater array of advertising and marketing tools to create product awareness of their offerings.
In the past several years, several major distilled spirits producers and national brewers have introduced flavored alcohol beverages. Products such as hard seltzers, Smirnoff Ice, the hard soda category, and Mike’s Hard Lemonade have captured sizable market share in the higher-priced end of the malt beverage industry. We believe sales of these products, along with strong growth in the import and craft beer segments of the malt beverage industry, contributed to an increase in the overall U.S. alcohol market. These products are particularly popular in certain regions and markets in which we sell our products.
Competition for consumers of craft beers also comes from wine and spirits, which reflects today’s millennial consumers who typically drink across three alcoholic beverage categories in a single drinking occasion. Growth in this segment appears to be attributable to competitive pricing, targeted advertising, increased merchandising and greater consumer interest in local wine and craft spirits. Recently, the wine industry has been aided, on a limited basis, by its ability to sell outside of the three-tier system, allowing sales to be made directly to consumers. While the craft beer segment competes with wine and spirits, it also benefits from many of the same advantages enjoyed by wine and spirit producers, including consumers who allow themselves affordable luxuries in the form of high quality alcoholic beverages.
A significant portion of our sales continues to be in the Pacific Northwest and in California, which we believe are among the most competitive craft beer markets in the U.S., both in terms of number of participants and consumer awareness. We believe that these areas offer significant competition for our products, not only from other craft brewers but also from the growing wine market and from flavored alcohol beverages. Additionally, we are monitoring the impact of cannabis as more states legalize marijuana for retail sales. Our recent marketing efforts have been focused on promoting the national relevance of Kona as a leading lifestyle brand, the authenticity of our pioneering owned brands and the creativity of our partner brands, along with better segmenting our marketing strategies to communicate the attributes of our portfolio to our target consumers. We believe that our broad array of beers and brands enables us to offer an assortment of flavors and experiences that appeal to more people.
Segment and Enterprise-Wide Information
See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for the required segment and enterprise-wide information.
Regulation
Our business is highly regulated at federal, state and local levels. Various permits, licenses and approvals necessary for our brewery, wineries and pub operations and the sale of alcoholic beverages are required from a number of agencies, including the U.S. Treasury Department, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (“TTB”), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the FDA, state alcohol regulatory agencies, and state and local health, sanitation, safety, fire and environmental agencies. In addition, the beer industry is subject to substantial federal and state excise taxes.
The FDA issued a proposed rule in November 2015 on the use of “gluten-free” labeling for fermented and hydrolyzed foods and beverages that may affect our ability to market our Omission Beer as “crafted to reduce gluten.” The proposed rule was under review by the Office of Management and Budget and was expected to become final in late 2018 but no final rule was ever issued. It appears the adoption will continue to be delayed under the current administration’s executive order to reduce and freeze new regulations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.
We operate our breweries, and wineries to produce hard cider, under federal licensing requirements imposed by the TTB. The TTB requires the filing of a “Brewer’s Notice” upon the establishment of a commercial brewery and the filing of an amended Brewer’s Notice whenever there is a material change in the brewing or warehousing locations, brewing or packaging equipment, brewery ownership, or officers or directors. The TTB requires us to obtain a winery permit and registration for each facility we produce hard cider. Our operations are subject to audit and inspection by the TTB at any time.
Management believes that we have all the licenses, permits and approvals required for our current operations. Existing permits or licenses could be revoked if we fail to comply with the terms of such permits or licenses and additional permits or licenses may be required in the future for our current operations or because of expanding our operations.
Beginning January 1, 2018, the federal excise taxes imposed on domestic brewers, such as us, that produce less than 2 million barrels annually, were reduced from $7.00 to $3.50 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels shipped annually and from $18.00 to $16.00 per barrel on the first 6 million barrels shipped annually for all other brewers and all beer importers. Barrels shipped in excess of 6 million barrels in a given year continue to be subject to a federal excise tax of $18 per barrel on beer sold for consumption

in the United States. Certain states also levy excise taxes on alcoholic beverages but are usually paid by the wholesaler. Also, while the existing excise tax on hard cider did not change from $0.226 per gallon, the small producer tax credit for hard cider was expanded to $0.062 on the first 30,000 gallons for an effective rate of $0.164 per gallon; the tax credit on the next 100,000 gallons produced became $0.056 for an effective rate of $0.17 per gallon; and producers like us who produce between 130,000 and 750,000 gallons of hard cider annually receive a $0.033 credit for an effective tax rate of $0.193 per gallon. We pay excise taxes in states where we produce (Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Florida).
Although the reductions in federal excise taxes described above are set to expire at the end of 2019, the Beer Institute, of which we are a member, and other industry groups support making federal excise tax relief for all brewers and beer importers permanent. Excise taxes may be increased in the future by the federal government or any state government or both. In the past, increases in excise taxes on alcoholic beverages have been considered in connection with various governmental budget-balancing or funding proposals.
Federal and State Environmental Regulation
Our brewing operations are subject to environmental regulations and local permitting requirements and agreements regarding, among other things, air emissions, water discharges and the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes. While we have no reason to believe the operation of our breweries violates any such regulation or requirement, if such a violation were to occur, or if environmental regulations were to become more stringent in the future, we could be adversely affected.
Dram Shop Laws
The serving of alcoholic beverages to a person known to be intoxicated may, under certain circumstances, result in the server being held liable to third parties for injuries caused by the intoxicated customer. Our restaurants and brewpubs have addressed this issue by maintaining reasonable hours of operation and routinely performing training for personnel.
Trademarks
We have obtained U.S. trademark registrations for numerous products. Trademark registrations generally include brand names and logos and specific product names. The Kona Brewing Co., Widmer Brothers Brewing, Redhook, and Omission marks and certain other marks are also registered in various foreign countries. We regard our Kona, Widmer Brothers, Redhook, Omission, Square Mile, Cisco, AMB, Wynwood and other trademarks as having substantial value and as being an important factor in the marketing of our products. We also have several similar international trademarks. We are not aware of any infringing uses that could materially affect our current business or any prior claim to the trademarks that would prevent us from using such trademarks in our business. Our policy is to pursue registration of our material trademarks in our markets whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our trademarks.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 665 people, including 310 employees in the brewpubs and retail stores, 150 employees in production, 131 employees in sales and marketing and 74 employees in corporate and administration. Included in the totals above are 187 part-time employees and 2 seasonal or temporary employees. None of our employees are represented by a union or employed under a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relations with our employees to be good.
