ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background
Pacific Mercantile Bancorp is a California corporation that owns 100% of the stock of Pacific Mercantile Bank, a California state chartered commercial bank (which, for convenience, will sometimes be referred to in this Report as the “Bank”). The capital stock of the Bank is our principal asset and substantially all of our business operations are conducted and substantially all of our assets are owned by the Bank which, as a result, accounts for substantially all of our revenues, expenses and income. As the owner of a commercial bank, Pacific Mercantile Bancorp is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “Bank Holding Company Act”), and, as such, our operations are regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board” or the “FRB”) and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (“FRBSF”) under delegated authority from the FRB. See “Supervision and Regulation” below in this Item 1 of this Report. PM Asset Resolution, Inc. (“PMAR”) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific Mercantile Bancorp, which existed for the purpose of purchasing certain non-performing loans and other real estate from the Bank and thereafter collecting on or disposing of those assets. During the year PMBC liquidated all assets at PMAR and during the third quarter of 2018, the entity was dissolved. For ease of reference, we will sometimes use the terms “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this Report to refer to Pacific Mercantile Bancorp on a consolidated basis and “PM Bancorp,” “Bancorp” or “PMBC” to refer to Pacific Mercantile Bancorp on a “stand-alone” or unconsolidated basis.
The Bank, which is headquartered in Orange County, California, approximately 40 miles south of Los Angeles, conducts a commercial banking business in Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Diego counties in Southern California. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and its deposits are insured, to the maximum extent permitted by law, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).
The Bank commenced business in March 1999, with the opening of its first financial center, located in Newport Beach, California, and in April 1999 it launched its online banking site at www.pmbank.com.
The Bank's commercial lending solutions include working capital lines of credit and asset based lending, 7(a) and 504 Small Business Administration ("SBA") loans, commercial real estate loans, growth capital loans, equipment financing, letters of credit and corporate credit cards. The Bank's depository and corporate banking services include cash and treasury management solutions, interest-bearing term deposit accounts, checking accounts, automated clearinghouse (“ACH”) payment and wire solutions, fraud protection, remote deposit capture, courier services, and online banking. Additionally, the Bank serves clients operating in the global marketplace through services including letters of credit and import/export financing.
The Bank attracts the majority of its loan and deposit business from the numerous small and middle market companies located in the Southern California region. The Bank reserves the right to change its business plan at any time, and no assurance can be given that, if the Bank's proposed business plan is followed, it will prove successful.
Our Business Strategy
We plan to expand our business by adhering to a business plan that is focused on building and growing a banking organization offering our customers the best attributes of a community bank, which are personalized and responsive service, while also offering the more sophisticated services of the big banks.
We will continue to focus our services and offer products primarily to small to mid-size businesses and professional firms in order to achieve internal growth of our banking franchise. We believe this focus will enable us to grow our loan portfolio and other earning assets and increase our core deposits (consisting of non-interest bearing demand, and lower-cost savings and money market deposits), with a goal to increase our net interest margin and improve our profitability. We also believe that, with our existing technology systems, we have the capability to increase the volume of our banking transactions without having to incur the cost or disruption of a major computer enhancement program. 
Following our transition to a commercial banking model, it has become clear that our current client base is well served through our treasury management tools and rarely makes use of full-service branches. We reduced the size of several branches during 2016 and 2017. The resultant cost savings from the branch reorganization was redeployed to expand our business development team and more actively promote our online banking. We will continue to explore opportunities to create efficiencies in our office locations and redeploy those cost savings. As we add more relationship managers, we believe we can better penetrate our core markets and accelerate the growth of our commercial customer base.

Our Commercial Banking Operations
We seek to meet the banking needs of small and mid-size businesses and professional firms by providing our customers with:

• | A broad range of loan and deposit products and banking and financial services, more typically offered by larger banks, in order to gain a competitive advantage over independent or community banks that do not provide the same range or breadth of services that we are able to provide to our customers; and


• | A high level of personal service and responsiveness, more typical of independent and community banks, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage over large out-of-state and other large multi-regional banks that may be unable, or unwilling, due to the expense involved, to provide that same level of personal service to this segment of the banking market.

Deposit Products
Deposits are a bank’s principal source of funds for making loans and acquiring other interest earning assets. Additionally, the interest expense that a bank must incur to attract and maintain deposits has a significant impact on its operating results. A bank’s interest expense, in turn, will be determined in large measure by the types of deposits that it offers to, and is able to attract from, its customers. Generally, banks seek to attract “core deposits” which consist of demand deposits that bear no interest and low cost interest-bearing checking, savings and money market deposits. By comparison, time deposits (also sometimes referred to as “certificates of deposit”), including those in denominations of $100,000 or more, usually bear much higher interest rates and are more interest-rate sensitive and volatile than core deposits. A bank that is not able to attract significant amounts of core deposits must rely on more expensive time deposits or alternative sources of cash, such as Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) borrowings, to fund interest-earning assets, which means that its cost of funds are likely to be higher and, as a result, its net interest margin is likely to be lower than a bank with a higher proportion of core deposits. See “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Results of Operations-Net Interest Income” in Item 7 of this Report.
The following table sets forth information regarding the composition, by type of deposits, maintained by our customers during the year ended and as of December 31, 2018:

Excludes certificates of deposit maintained by PMAR at the Bank with an average balance of $75,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no certificates of deposit maintained by PMAR at December 31, 2018.

Loan Products
We offer our customers a number of different loan products, including commercial loans and credit lines, accounts receivable and inventory financing, SBA guaranteed business loans, and owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. The following table sets forth the types and the amounts of our loans that were outstanding as of December 31, 2018:
3


 | At December 31, 2018 
 | Amount | | Percent of Total
 | (Dollars in thousands)
Commercial loans | $ | 444,441 | | | 40.6 | %
Commercial real estate loans – owner occupied | 211,645 | | | 19.3 | % 
Commercial real estate loans – all other | 226,441 | | | 20.7 | % 
Residential mortgage loans – multi-family | 97,173 | | | 8.9 | % 
Residential mortgage loans – single family(1) | 21,176 | | | 1.9 | % 
Land development loans | 38,496 | | | 3.5 | % 
Consumer loans | 54,514 | | | 5.0 | % 
Gross loans | $ | 1,093,886 | | | 100.0 | %


(1) | These loans originated prior to March 2014 and our subsequent exit from the mortgage business and are retained in our loan portfolio as a loan diversification strategy.

Commercial Loans
The commercial loans we offer generally include short-term secured and unsecured business and commercial loans with maturities ranging from 12 to 24 months, accounts receivable financing for terms of up to 24 months, equipment loans which generally amortize over a period of up to 7 years, and SBA guaranteed business loans with terms of up to 10 years. The interest rates on these loans generally are adjustable and usually are indexed to The Wall Street Journal’s prime rate and will vary based on market conditions and credit risk. In order to mitigate the risk of borrower default, we generally require collateral to support the credit or, in the case of loans made to businesses, we often require personal guarantees from their owners, or both. In addition, all such loans must have well-defined primary and secondary sources of repayment. 
We also offer asset-based lending products made to businesses that are growing rapidly, but cannot internally fund their growth without borrowings. These loans are collateralized by a security interest in all business assets with specific advance rates made against the borrower's accounts receivable and inventory. We control our risk by monitoring borrower cash flow, financial performance and accounts receivable and inventory reports. In 2016, we centralized our loan monitoring function as a means to achieve improved portfolio risk monitoring of substantially all commercial loans, including asset-based loans.
Commercial loan growth is important to the growth and profitability of our banking franchise because commercial loan borrowers typically establish noninterest-bearing (demand) and interest-bearing transaction deposit accounts and banking services relationships with us. Those deposit accounts help us to reduce our overall cost of funds and those banking services relationships provide us with a source of non-interest income.
Commercial Real Estate Loans
The majority of our commercial real estate loans are secured by first trust deeds on nonresidential real property. Loans secured by nonresidential real estate often involve loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Payments on these loans depend to a large degree on the rental income stream from the properties and the global cash flows of the borrowers, which are generated from a wide variety of businesses and industries. As a result, repayment of these loans can be affected adversely by changes in the economy in general or by the real estate market more specifically. Accordingly, the nature of this type of loan makes it more difficult to monitor and evaluate. Consequently, we typically require personal guarantees from the owners of the businesses to which we make such loans.
Business Banking Services
We offer an array of banking and financial services designed to support the needs of our business banking clients. Those services include:

• | Our online business banking portal allows our clients to conduct online transactions and access account information; features include the ability to:


◦ | View account balances and activity, including statements

• | Fraud prevention services such as Positive Pay, ACH Positive Pay, and transactional alerts.

Security Measures
Our ability to provide customers with secure and uninterrupted financial services is of paramount importance to our business. We believe our computer banking systems, services and software meet the highest standards of bank and electronic systems security. The following are among the security measures that we have implemented:
Bank-Wide Security Measures

• | Service Continuity. In order to better ensure continuity of service, we have located our critical servers and telecommunications systems at an offsite hardened and secure data center. This center provides the physical environment necessary to keep servers up and running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This data center has raised floors, temperature control systems with separate cooling zones, seismically braced racks, and generators to keep the system operating during power outages and has been designed to withstand fires and major earthquakes. The center also has a wide range of physical security features, including smoke detection and fire suppression systems, motion sensors, and 24/7 secured access, as well as video camera surveillance and security breach alarms. The center is connected to the Internet by redundant high speed data circuits with advanced capacity monitoring.


• | Physical Security. All servers and network computers reside in secure facilities. Only employees with proper identification may enter the primary server areas.


• | Monitoring. Customer transactions on online servers and internal computer systems produce one or more entries into transactional logs. Our personnel routinely review these logs as a means of identifying and taking appropriate action with respect to any abnormal or unusual activity.

Internet Security Measures
We maintain electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard nonpublic personal information. We regularly assess and update our systems to improve our technology for protecting information. Our security measures include:

• | Transport Layer Security;


• | digital certificates;


• | multi-factor authentication;


• | data loss prevention systems;


• | anti-virus, anti-malware, and patch management systems;


• | intrusion detection/prevention systems;


• | vulnerability management systems; and


• | firewall protection.

5

We believe the risk of fraud presented by online banking is not materially different from the risk of fraud inherent in any banking relationship. Potential security breaches can arise from any of the following circumstances:

• | misappropriation of a customer’s account number or password;


• | compromise of the customer’s computer system;


• | penetration of our servers by an outside “hacker;”


• | fraud committed by a new customer in completing his or her loan application or opening a deposit account with us; and


• | fraud committed by employees or service providers.

Both traditional banks and internet banks are vulnerable to these types of fraud. By establishing the security measures described above, we believe we can minimize, to the extent practicable, our vulnerability to the first three types of fraud. To counteract fraud by new customers, employees and service providers, we have established internal procedures and policies designed to ensure that, as in any bank, proper control and supervision is exercised over new customers, employees and service providers. We also maintain insurance to protect us from losses due to fraud committed by employees or through breaches in our cyber security.
Additionally, the adequacy of our security measures is reviewed periodically by the FRBSF and the California Department of Business Oversight (“CDBO”), which are the federal and state government agencies, respectively, with primary supervisory authority over the Bank. We also retain the services of third party computer security firms to conduct periodic tests of our computer and online banking systems to identify potential threats to the security of our systems and to recommend additional actions that we can take to improve our security measures.
Competition
Competitive Conditions in the Traditional Banking Environment
The banking business in California generally, and in our service area in particular, is highly competitive and is dominated by a relatively small number of large multi-state and California-based banks that have numerous banking offices operating over wide geographic areas. We compete for deposits and loans with those banks, with community banks that are based or have branch offices in our market areas, and with savings banks (also sometimes referred to as “thrifts”), credit unions, money market and other mutual funds, stock brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other traditional and nontraditional financial service organizations. We also compete for customers’ funds with governmental and private entities issuing debt or equity securities or other forms of investments which may offer different and potentially higher yields than those available through bank deposits.
Major financial institutions that operate throughout California and that have offices in our service areas include Bank of America, Wells Fargo Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Union Bank of California, Bank of the West, U. S. Bancorp, Comerica Bank and Citibank. Larger independent banks and other financial institutions with offices in our service areas include, among others, OneWest Bank, City National Bank, Citizens Business Bank, Manufacturers Bank, and California Bank and Trust.
These banks, as well as many other financial institutions in our service areas, have the financial capability to conduct extensive advertising campaigns and to shift their resources to regions or activities of greater potential profitability. Many of them also offer diversified financial services which we do not presently offer directly. The larger banks and financial institutions also have substantially more capital and higher lending limits than our Bank.
In order to compete with the banks and other financial institutions operating in our service areas, we rely on our ability to provide flexible, more convenient and more personalized service to customers, including online banking services and financial tools. At the same time, we:

• | emphasize personal contacts with existing and potential new customers by our directors, officers and other employees;


• | develop and participate in local promotional activities; and


• | seek to develop specialized or streamlined services for customers.

To the extent customers desire loans in excess of our lending limits or services not offered by us, we attempt to assist them in obtaining such loans or other services through participations with other banks or assistance from our correspondent banks or third party vendors.

Competitive Conditions in Online Banking
There are a number of banks that offer services exclusively over the internet, such as E*TRADE Bank, and other banks, such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank, that market their internet banking services to their customers nationwide. We believe that only the larger of the commercial banks with which we compete offer the comprehensive set of online banking tools and services that we offer to our customers. However, most community banks do offer varying levels of internet banking services to their customers by relying on third party vendors to provide the functionality they need to provide such services. Additionally, many of the larger banks have greater market presence and greater financial resources to market their internet banking services than do we. Moreover, new competitors (including non-bank fintech start-ups) and other competitive factors have emerged over the past few years as part of the rapid development of internet commerce. We believe that these findings support our strategic decision, made at the outset of our business, to offer customers the benefits of both traditional and online banking services. However, utilization trends continue to show that our clients largely favor online banking services over traditional branch services. Thus, we have reduced and expect to continue to reduce the size of our branches and are redeploying the cost savings to expand our business development team and to more actively promote our online banking. We believe that this strategy has been an important factor in our recent growth in core deposits and will contribute to our growth in the future. See “BUSINESS — Our Business Strategy” earlier in this Item 1 of this Report.
Impact of Economic Conditions, Government Policies and Legislation on our Business
Government Monetary Policies. Our profitability, like that of most financial institutions, is affected to a significant extent by our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we generate on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest we pay on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, such as borrowings. Our interest income and interest expense, and hence our net interest income, depends to a great extent on prevailing market rates of interest, which are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including inflation, recession and unemployment. Moreover, it is often difficult to predict with any assurance how changes in economic conditions of this nature will affect our future financial performance.
Our net interest income and operating results also are affected by monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board implements national monetary policies to curb inflation, or to stimulate borrowing and spending in response to economic downturns, through its open-market operations by adjusting the required level of reserves that banks and other depository institutions must maintain, and by varying the target federal funds and discount rates on borrowings by banks and other depository institutions. These actions affect the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and the interest earned on interest-earning assets and paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The nature and impact of any future changes in monetary and fiscal policies on us cannot be predicted with any assurance.
Legislation Generally. From time to time, federal and state legislation is enacted which can affect our operations and our operating results by materially changing the costs of doing business, limiting or expanding the activities in which banks and other financial institutions may engage, or altering the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers.
Economic Conditions and Recent Legislation and Other Government Actions.
The last economic recession, which is reported to have begun at the end of 2007 and ended in the middle of 2009, created wide ranging consequences and difficulties for the banking and financial services industry, in particular, and the economy in general. The recession led to significant write-downs of the assets and an erosion of the capital of a large number of banks and other lending and financial institutions which, in turn, significantly and adversely affected the operating results of banking and other financial institutions and led to steep declines in their stock prices. In addition, bank regulatory agencies have been very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in their bank examinations, which has resulted in the increased issuance of enforcement orders requiring banks to take actions to address credit quality, liquidity and risk management and capital adequacy, as well as other safety and soundness concerns. All of these conditions, moreover, led the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Treasury Department and the federal banking regulators, including the FDIC, to take broad actions, to address systemic risks and volatility in the U.S. banking system. A description of some of the regulatory and other actions taken, and their impact on the Company, are described below under “Supervision and Regulation.” 
Supervision and Regulation 
Both federal and state laws extensively regulate bank holding companies and banks. Such regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund and customers, and is not for the benefit of shareholders. Set forth below is a summary description of the material laws and regulations that affect or bear on our operations. The description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the laws and regulations that are summarized below. 
7

Pacific Mercantile Bancorp 
PM Bancorp is a registered bank holding company subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act. Pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act, PM Bancorp is subject to supervision and periodic examination by, and is required to file periodic reports with, the Federal Reserve Board. PM Bancorp is also a bank holding company within the meaning of the California Financial Code. As such, PM Bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to supervision and periodic examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the CDBO.
As a bank holding company, PM Bancorp is allowed to engage, directly or indirectly, only in banking and other activities that the Federal Reserve Board deems to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the Bank Holding Company Act and elect and retain "financial holding company" status may engage in broader securities, insurance, merchant banking and other activities that are determined to be "financial in nature" or are incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature without prior FRB approval. PM Bancorp has not elected financial holding company status and neither PM Bancorp nor the Bank has engaged in any activities for which financial holding company status is required. 
As a bank holding company, PM Bancorp is also required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board for the acquisition of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities, or of substantially all of the assets, by merger with or purchase of (i) any bank or other bank holding company and (ii) any other entities engaged in banking-related businesses or that provide banking-related services. 
The Dodd-Frank Act requires PM Bancorp to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank including committing resources to support the Bank even at times when PM Bancorp may not be in a financial position or believe that it is in the best interest of our shareholders to do so. It is the Federal Reserve Board’s policy that, in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks, a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. For these reasons, among others, the Federal Reserve Board requires all bank holding companies to maintain capital at or above certain prescribed levels. A bank holding company’s failure to meet these requirements will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve Board to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve Board’s regulations or both, which could lead to the imposition of restrictions on the offending bank holding company, including restrictions on its further growth. See the discussion below under the caption “Prompt Corrective Action.” In addition, under the cross‑guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”), the FDIC can hold any FDIC‑insured depository institution liable for any loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC‑insured depository institution or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to such a commonly controlled institution.
Additionally, the Federal Reserve Board may require any bank holding company to terminate an activity or terminate control of, or liquidate or divest itself of, any subsidiary or affiliated company that the Federal Reserve Board determines constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of the bank holding company or any of its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve Board also has the authority to regulate aspects of a bank holding company’s debt. Subject to certain exceptions, bank holding companies also are required to file written notice and obtain approval from the Federal Reserve Board prior to purchasing or redeeming their common stock or other equity securities. A bank holding company and its non-banking subsidiaries also are prohibited from implementing so-called tying arrangements whereby customers may be required to use or purchase services or products from the bank holding company or any of its non-bank subsidiaries in order to obtain a loan or other services from any of the holding company’s subsidiary banks. 
Pacific Mercantile Bank 
General. The Bank is subject to primary supervision, periodic examination and regulation by (i) the Federal Reserve Board, which is its primary federal banking regulator, because the Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and (ii) the CDBO, because the Bank is a California state chartered bank. The Bank also is subject to certain of the regulations promulgated by the FDIC, because its deposits are insured by the FDIC. 
Various requirements and restrictions under the Federal and California banking laws affect the operations of the Bank. These laws and the implementing regulations cover most aspects of a bank’s operations, including the reserves a bank must maintain against deposits and for possible loan losses and other contingencies; the types of deposits it obtains and the interest it is permitted to pay on certain deposit accounts; the loans and investments that a bank may make; the borrowings that a bank may incur; the number and location of banking offices that a bank may establish; the rate at which it may grow its assets; the acquisition and merger activities of a bank; the amount of dividends that a bank may pay; and the capital requirements that a bank must satisfy, which can determine the extent of supervisory control to which a bank will be subject by its federal and state bank regulators. A more detailed discussion regarding capital requirements that are applicable to us and the Bank is set forth below under the caption “Prompt Corrective Action.”
8

Permissible Activities and Subsidiaries. California law permits state chartered commercial banks to engage in any activity permissible for national banks. Those permissible activities include conducting many so-called “closely related to banking” or “nonbanking” activities either directly or through their operating subsidiaries. 
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of San Francisco. Among other benefits, each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region and makes available loans or advances to its member banks. Each FHLB is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. As an FHLB member, the Bank is required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the FHLB. At December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with the FHLB’s stock ownership requirement. Historically, the FHLB has paid dividends on its capital stock to its members. 
FRB Deposit Reserve Requirements. The Federal Reserve Board requires all federally-insured depository institutions to maintain noninterest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts. At December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with these requirements. 
Single Borrower Loan Limitations. With certain limited exceptions, the maximum amount that a California state bank may lend to any borrower (including certain related entities) at any one time may not exceed 15% of the sum of the shareholders’ equity, allowance for loan and lease losses, capital notes and debentures of the bank if unsecured. The combined unsecured and secured obligations of any borrower may not exceed 25% of the sum of the shareholders’ equity, allowance for loan and lease losses, capital notes and debentures of the bank.
Restrictions on Transactions between the Bank and the Company and its other Affiliates. The Bank is subject to restrictions imposed by federal law on any extensions of credit to, or the issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit on behalf of, the Company or any of its other subsidiaries; the purchase of, or investments in, Company stock or other Company securities and the taking of such securities as collateral for loans; and the purchase of assets from the Company or any of its other subsidiaries. These restrictions prevent the Company and any of its subsidiaries from borrowing from the Bank unless the loans are secured by marketable obligations in designated amounts, and such secured loans and investments by the Bank in the Company or any of its subsidiaries are limited, individually, to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus (as defined by federal regulations) and, in the aggregate, for all loans made to and investments made in the Company and its other subsidiaries, to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. California law also imposes restrictions with respect to transactions involving the Company and other persons deemed under that law to control the Bank. It is the policy of the federal banking agencies that tax sharing agreements between a bank holding company and subsidiary bank that file consolidated tax returns must provide that any refund received by the holding company be allocated between the holding company and the bank in proportion to their respective income, losses and other tax characteristics as if they had filed on a stand-alone basis and, until the bank’s share is paid to it (which should be done promptly upon receipt), its share must be held in trust or as agent for the benefit of the bank, and not merely owed by the holding company as a debt to the bank.
Enforcement. If, as a result of an examination of a bank, its primary federal bank regulatory agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of a bank’s operations had become unsatisfactory or that the bank or its management was in violation of any law or regulation, that agency has the authority to take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate under the circumstances. These actions include the power to enjoin “unsafe or unsound” banking practices; to require that affirmative action be taken to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice; to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced; to require the bank to increase its capital; to restrict the bank’s growth; to assess civil monetary penalties against the bank or its officers or directors; to remove officers and directors of the bank; and, if the federal agency concludes that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate a bank’s deposit insurance, which in the case of a California chartered bank would result in revocation of its charter and require it to cease its banking operations. Additionally, under California law the CDBO has many of the same remedial powers with respect to the Bank, because it is a California state chartered bank. 
9

Dividends 
Cash dividends from the Bank constitute the primary source of cash available to PM Bancorp for its operations and to fund any cash dividends that the board of directors might declare in the future. PM Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and the Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay cash dividends to PM Bancorp. Those restrictions would prohibit the Bank, subject to certain limited exceptions, from paying cash dividends in amounts that would cause the Bank to become undercapitalized. Additionally, the Federal Reserve Board and the CDBO have the authority to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends, if either of those authorities deems the payment of dividends by the Bank to be an unsafe or unsound practice. We have agreed that the Bank will not, without the FRB and the CDBO's prior written approval, pay any dividends to PM Bancorp. See “Dividend Policy and Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends” in Item 5 of this Report. 
Additionally, it is FRB policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. It is also an FRB policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to their banking subsidiaries. Additionally, the FRB has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policies and has discouraged dividend payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. We have committed to obtaining approval from the FRB and the CDBO prior to paying any dividends. There can be no assurance that our regulators will approve such payments or dividends in the future. 
Safety and Soundness Standards 
Banking institutions may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices or for violating any law, rule, regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by its primary federal banking regulatory agency or any written agreement with that agency. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines designed to identify and address potential safety and soundness concerns that could, if not corrected, lead to deterioration in the quality of a bank’s assets, liquidity or capital. Those guidelines set forth operational and managerial standards relating to such matters as: 
•internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems;
•loan documentation;
•credit underwriting;
•asset growth;
•earnings; and 
•compensation, fees and benefits.
In addition, federal banking agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines with respect to asset quality. These guidelines provide standards for establishing and maintaining a system to identify problem assets and prevent those assets from deteriorating. Under these standards, an FDIC-insured depository institution is expected to: 

• | conduct periodic asset quality reviews to identify problem assets, estimate the inherent losses in problem assets and establish reserves that are sufficient to absorb those estimated losses;


• | compare problem asset totals to capital;


• | take appropriate corrective action to resolve problem assets;


• | consider the size and potential risks of material asset concentrations; and


• | provide periodic asset quality reports with adequate information for the Bank's management and the board of directors to assess the level of asset risk.

These guidelines also establish standards for evaluating and monitoring earnings and for ensuring that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves. 
Capital Requirements
The Company and the Bank are subject to the regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. The federal banking agencies’ current risk-based capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord (“Basel I”) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”). The Basel Committee is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors/regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country’s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply. The requirements are intended to ensure that banking organizations 
10

have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Under the requirements, banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as letters of credit). For purposes of calculating the ratios, a banking organization’s assets and some of its specified off-balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories. A bank’s or bank holding company’s capital, in turn, is classified in one of two tiers, depending on type:

• | Core Capital (Tier 1). Tier 1 capital includes common equity, retained earnings, qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries (and, under existing standards, a limited amount of qualifying trust preferred securities and qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock at the holding company level), less goodwill, most intangible assets and certain other assets.


• | Supplementary Capital (Tier 2). Tier 2 capital includes, among other things, perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities not meeting the Tier 1 definition, qualifying mandatory convertible debt securities, qualifying subordinated debt, and allowances for loan and lease losses, subject to limitations.

These capital requirements were modified effective as of January 1, 2015 in connection with commencement of Basel III Capital Rules described below. Through 2014, we were required to maintain Tier 1 capital and “total capital” (the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) equal to at least 4.0% and 8.0%, respectively, of our total risk-weighted assets (including various off-balance-sheet items, such as letters of credit). The Bank, like other depository institutions, was required to maintain similar capital levels under capital adequacy guidelines. In addition, for a depository institution to be considered “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, its Tier 1 and total capital ratios must have been at least 6.0% and 10.0% on a risk-adjusted basis, respectively.
Bank holding companies and banks are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements. The leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization’s Tier 1 capital to its total adjusted quarterly average assets (as defined for regulatory purposes). Through 2014, the requirements necessitated a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0% for bank holding companies and banks that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority’s risk-adjusted measure for market risk. All other bank holding companies and banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, unless a different minimum is specified by an appropriate regulatory authority. In addition, for a depository institution to be considered “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, its leverage ratio must be at least 5.0%. 
Basel III Capital Rules. As of January 1, 2015, the Basel III Capital Rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations took effect. The rules implement the Basel Committee’s December 2010 framework known as “Basel III” for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including the Company and the Bank, compared to the current U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing risk-weighting approach, which was derived from the Basel I capital accords of the Basel Committee, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach in the Basel Committee’s 2004 “Basel II” capital accords. The Basel III Capital Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies’ rules. The Basel III Capital Rules were effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015 subject to a phase-in period ending on January 1, 2019. Under a Federal Reserve Board policy amended in 2018, qualifying bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $3.0 billion, such as the Company, are exempt from the requirements of the Basel III Capital Rules. The Bank, however, is subject to these rules.
The Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, (i) introduce a new capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments as compared to existing regulations.
The Basel III capital Rules also include a capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will be phased in over a three-year period (increasing by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). 
As fully phased in as of January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules require the Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus the 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” effectively resulting in a minimum ratio 
11

of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%), and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets .
The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a “countercyclical capital buffer” that is applicable to only certain larger, covered institutions and is not expected to have any current applicability to the Company or the Bank.
The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1 for mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets, significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities and the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Basel III Capital Rules also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, as Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies, subject to phase-out, but institutions with less than $15 billion in assets are exempted from this new rule. 
With respect to the Bank, the Basel III Capital Rules also revise the “prompt corrective action” regulations as discussed below under “Prompt Corrective Action.”
The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. 
In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation.
As of December 31, 2018, the capital levels of the Bank exceed the minimums necessary to be categorized as well capitalized under the Basel III Capital Rules, including the applicable capital conservation buffers. See “See “Item 7. — MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Capital Resources — Regulatory Capital Requirements Applicable to Banking Institutions.”
Liquidity Requirements
Historically, the regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without required formulaic measures. In September 2013, the federal banking agencies adopted rules to impose quantitative liquidity requirements consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio standard established by the Basel Committee. These rules apply to larger (over $250 billion in assets, with less stringent requirements for institutions over $50 billion in assets) and internationally active institutions but, as adopted, do not apply to the Company or the Bank. 
Prompt Corrective Action
The FDIA, requires among other things, the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA includes the following five capital tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The relevant capital measures are the total capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio and the leverage ratio. The Basel III Capital Rules affect the capital requirements for prompt corrective action purposes also.
A bank is (i) “well capitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 ratio of 6.5% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) “adequately capitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.0% or greater, a CET1 ratio of 4.5% or greater and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not “well capitalized”; (iii) “undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a CET1 ratio of less than 4.5% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%; (iv) “significantly undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3.0%, a CET1 ratio of less than 3.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v) “critically undercapitalized” if the institution’s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank’s capital category is determined solely for the purpose 
12

of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.
The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be “undercapitalized.” “Undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The agencies may not accept such a plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5.0% of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.”
“Significantly undercapitalized” depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.
The appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory information other than the capital levels of the institution.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank (on a stand-alone basis) continued to qualify as a well-capitalized institution, and the Company continued to exceed the minimum required capital ratios applicable to it, under the capital adequacy guidelines described above.
FDIC Deposit Insurance 
The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures customer deposits of federally insured banks and savings institutions in order to safeguard the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries through the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) up to prescribed limits, currently $250,000 per depositor. The DIF is funded primarily by FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution. The amount of each DIF member’s assessment is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors. Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005, the FDIC is authorized to set the reserve ratio for the DIF annually at between 1.15% and 1.50% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semi-annual basis. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum reserve ratio (the ratio of the net worth of the DIF to estimated insured deposits) from 1.15% of estimated deposits to 1.35% of estimated deposits (or a comparable percentage of the asset-based assessment base described above). The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio when setting assessments for insured depository institutions with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Bank. The FDIC has until September 30, 2020 to achieve the new minimum reserve ratio of 1.35%. 
Additionally, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (“FICO”), an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF. The FICO assessment rates, which are determined quarterly, averaged approximately 0.00305% of insured deposits in fiscal 2018. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature through 2019. 
The FDIC may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of the bank’s depositors. Pursuant to California law, the termination of a California state chartered bank’s FDIC deposit insurance would result in the revocation of the bank’s charter, forcing it to cease conducting banking operations.
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws 
The Bank is subject to fair lending requirements and the evaluation of its small business operations under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”). The CRA generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a bank in meeting the credit needs of its local communities, including those of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods in its service area. A bank’s compliance with its CRA obligations is based on a performance-based evaluation system which determines the bank’s CRA ratings on the basis of its community lending and community development performance. When a bank holding company files an application for approval to acquire a bank or another bank holding company, the Federal Reserve Board will review the CRA assessment of 
13

each of the subsidiary banks of the applicant bank holding company, and a low CRA rating may be the basis for denying the application. 
A bank may be subject to substantial penalties and corrective measures for a violation of fair lending laws. Federal banking agencies also may take compliance with fair lending laws into account when determining a bank's CRA rating and when regulating and supervising other activities of a bank or its bank holding company. 
USA Patriot Act of 2001 
In October 2001, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (“USA Patriot Act”) of 2001 was enacted into law in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The USA Patriot Act was adopted to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. 
Of particular relevance to banks and other federally insured depository institutions are the USA Patriot Act’s sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions and various related implementing regulations that: 

• | establish due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer, maintain, or manage private bank accounts and foreign correspondent accounts;


• | prohibit U.S. institutions from providing correspondent accounts to foreign shell banks;


• | establish standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; and


• | set rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulatory agencies and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering.

Under implementing regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, banking institutions are required to incorporate a customer identification program into their written money laundering plans that includes procedures for: 

• | verifying the identity of any person seeking to open an account, to the extent reasonable and practicable;


• | maintaining records of the information used to verify the person’s identity; and


• | determining whether the person appears on any list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations.

Consumer Laws 
The Company and the Bank are subject to a broad range of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition. Those laws and regulations include: 

• | The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994, which requires additional disclosures and consumer protections to borrowers designed to protect them against certain lending practices, such as practices deemed to constitute “predatory lending.”


• | Laws and regulations requiring banks to establish privacy policies which limit the disclosure of nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties.


• | The Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which requires banking institutions and financial services businesses to adopt practices and procedures designed to help deter identity theft, including developing appropriate fraud response programs, and provides consumers with greater control of their credit data.


• | The Truth in Lending Act, which requires that credit terms be disclosed in a meaningful and consistent way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably.


• | The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which generally prohibits, in connection with any consumer or business credit transaction, discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), or the fact that a borrower is receiving income from public assistance programs.


• | The Fair Housing Act, which regulates many lending practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status.

14


• | The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which includes a “fair lending” aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes.


• | The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements and prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks.


• | The National Flood Insurance Act, which requires homes in flood-prone areas with mortgages from a federally regulated lender to have flood insurance.


• | The Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, which requires mortgage loan originator employees of federally insured institutions to register with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, a database created by the states to support the licensing of mortgage loan originators, prior to originating residential mortgage loans.

Regulation W 
The FRB has adopted Regulation W to comprehensively implement Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. 
Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W limit transactions between a bank and its affiliates (which include its holding company) and limit a bank’s ability to transfer to its affiliates the benefits arising from the bank’s access to insured deposits, the payment system and the discount window and other benefits of the Federal Reserve system. The statute and regulation impose quantitative and qualitative limits on the ability of a bank to extend credit to, or engage in certain other transactions with, an affiliate (and a non-affiliate if an affiliate benefits from the transaction). However, certain transactions that generally do not expose a bank to undue risk or abuse the safety net are exempted from coverage under Regulation W. 
Historically, a subsidiary of a bank was not considered an affiliate for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B, since their activities were limited to activities permissible for the bank itself. However, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorized “financial subsidiaries” that may engage in activities not permissible for a bank. These financial subsidiaries are now considered affiliates. Certain transactions between a financial subsidiary and another affiliate of a bank are also covered by Sections 23A and 23B and under Regulation W. 
Privacy 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the California Financial Information Privacy Act require financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. In general, the statutes require explanations to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibit disclosing such information except as provided in the Bank's policies and procedures. We have implemented privacy policies addressing these restrictions which are distributed regularly to all existing and new customers of the Bank. 
Customer Information Security 
The FRB and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal customer information. These guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazard to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. We have adopted a customer information security program to comply with such requirements. 
Incentive Compensation 
In June 2010, the FRB and the FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization's incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization's ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors. These three principles are incorporated into proposed joint compensation regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act that would prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total 
15

assets that encourage inappropriate risks. The FRB will review, as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not "large, complex banking organizations." These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization's activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization's supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization's ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization's safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiency. 
Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives 
From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in the U.S. Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on our business. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 160 persons on a full-time equivalent basis and 0 persons on a part-time basis for a total of 160 persons. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe relations with our employees are good.
