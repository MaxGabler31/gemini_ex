ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

​
History and Organization
​
Gold Resource Corporation was organized under the laws of Colorado, USA on August 24, 1998. Since 2010, GRC has produced gold and silver doré and copper, lead, and zinc concentrates in Oaxaca, Mexico at our subsidiary, Don David Gold Mexico S.A. de C.V. (“Don David Gold Mine” or “DDGM”). The Don David Gold Mine holds six (6) properties which are all located in what is known as the San Jose structural corridor. Our properties span 55 continuous kilometers of this structural corridor which include three historic mining districts in Oaxaca.
​
On December 10, 2021, the Company successfully completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding common shares of Aquila Resources Inc (the “Aquila Transaction”). Aquila’s principal asset is its 100% interest in the Back Forty Project located in Menominee County, Michigan, USA. The Back Forty Project has a polymetallic (gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc) Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide deposit. The Back Forty Project controls surface and mineral rights through ownership and leases with the State of Michigan. The Company is currently advancing a definitive feasibility study and preparing permit applications.
​
In this report, “Company,” “our,” “us” and “we” refer to Gold Resource Corporation together with our subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. See the glossary for additional definitions.

Mexico Production Stage Properties:
​
The primary production stage properties at DDGM commenced operations in 2010. The operation included the Arista open pit and underground mine and the DDGM processing facility. The underground mine was expanded in 2016 with the development of the Switchback vein system. The Arista underground mine is located approximately two kilometers from the processing facility. Additionally, underground mining at the Alta Gracia mine was conducted from 2017 to 2019. Alta Gracia is approximately 32 kilometers from the processing facilities. 
​
The DDGM processing facility produces doré and metal concentrates from ore mined from both the Arista and Alta Gracia Mines. The Arista and Alta Gracia mines include a total of approximately 30,000 hectares of mining concessions, access roads from a major highway, haul roads, a processing facility and adjoining buildings, an assay lab, a now depleted open pit, underground mines, tailings facilities, and other infrastructure. Please see Item 2. Properties for additional information. 
​
Mexico Exploration Prospects:
​
Within the 55-kilometer-long San Jose structural corridor, in Oaxaca, Mexico, sits a highly prospective ground package. Multiple volcanic domes of various scales, and likely non-vented intrusive domes, dominate the district geology. These volcanogenic features are imposed on a pre-volcanic basement of sedimentary rocks. Gold and silver, as well as base metal mineralization in this district is related to the manifestations of this classic volcanogenic system and is considered epithermal in character. The Company intends to advance organic growth and to unlock the value of the mine, existing infrastructure, and our large property position by continuing to invest in exploration and development. Please see Item 2. Properties for additional information.

Back Forty Project:
There is a long history of exploration and studies being performed at the Back Forty Project. In 2014, a Preliminary Feasibility Study prepared under Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”) was completed which contemplated an open pit mine and processing operation. In October 2019, Aquila filed a NI 43-101 Feasibility Study which estimated the open pit project would produce 1.1 million gold equivalent ounces over a seven-year mine life. Over the next couple of years, the necessary permits were obtained. In August 2020, a Preliminary Economic Assessment was published. In January 2021, the water permit was revoked due to a technicality related to a contingent condition established in the permit. In 2021, a Definitive Feasibility Study was initiated to address the mine’s footprint, potential for an underground mine,

The SEC site may also be accessed through a link in our website. 
Before the acquisition of Aquila Resources Inc., Aquila’s common shares were traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the ticker symbol AQA. Effective December 10, 2021, Aquila ceased to be a reporting issuer in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Nova Scotia. At the same time, GRC has become a reporting issuer in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Nova Scotia by virtue of the completion of the acquisition. As a Canadian Issuer, GRC is now required to file reports on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (“SEDAR”) in Canada. All financial statements filed on SEDAR will conform to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”).
2021 Developments
​
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company reported net income of $8.0 million. Financial results for 2021 include revenue of $125.2 million and mine gross profit of $36.7 million. Although DDGM experienced some ground support challenges early in the year and voluntarily ramped down operations in mid-August and early September 2021 at the Don David Gold Mine due to a spike in COVID-19 cases, the Company achieved solid production results totaling 26,438 gold ounces, 1,200,291 silver ounces, 1,506 copper tonnes, 7,544 lead tonnes and 17,329 zinc tonnes.

Seventh consecutiveESR award

​




​
For the seventh consecutive year, the Don David Gold Mine received the prestigious Empresa Socialmente Responsable (“ESR”) award from the Mexican Center for Philanthropy (CEMEFI). Awards are given to organizations that demonstrate a commitment to supporting social and environmental protection programs within their local communities.
​
The Company finalized the construction of the water filtration and dry stack facilities in 2021. The dry stacked tailings will accelerate reclamation of certain areas of the open pit mine, as well as allowing for the extension of life of the current tailings facility.
​
We completed 112 underground diamond drill holes totaling 25,104 meters and 30 surface diamond drill holes totaling 9,930 meters at the Arista mine during 2021. Our exploration activities were mainly focused on exploration drilling at the Arista and Switchback vein systems in the Arista Mine. The Switchback drill program targeted the expansion and delineation of multiple high-grade parallel veins to define additional Mineral Reserves and optimize the mine plan. Likewise, we continued to explore for extensions of the Arista vein system currently in production. Surface geologic mapping and rock chip sampling also continued in the vicinity of the Arista Mine, the DDGM open pit, and the geological targets Cerro Pilon and Cerro Colorado among other prospects. Our exploration efforts demonstrate our commitment to long-term investment in Oaxaca, Mexico.

Dividends 
​
During 2021, we paid dividends of $0.0433 per share. Please see Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities for additional information.
​
Insurance
​
Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and facilities. For more information, please see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, below. We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insure against most risks that are typical in the operation of our business in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to property loss, environmental liability, and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors, below for additional information.
​
Competitive Business Conditions
​
The acquisition of gold and silver properties is subject to intense competition. Identifying and evaluating potential mining prospects is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. In 2021, we were successful in acquiring the Back Forty Project as discussed above. In 2022, we expect to continue our significant investment in exploration and growth activities; however, we believe that competition for acquiring mineral prospects will continue to be intense in the future.
​
Government Regulations and Permits 
​
In connection with mining, milling and exploration activities in Mexico, we are subject to Mexican federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including laws and regulations relating to protection of air and water quality, hazardous waste management and mine reclamation as well as the protection of endangered or threatened species. The government department responsible for environmental protection in Mexico is Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (“SEMARNAT”). SEMARNAT has broad authority over environmental regulations and standards. Potential areas of environmental consideration for mining companies, such as ours, include but are not limited to, acid rock drainage, cyanide containment and handling, contamination of water sources, dust, and noise.
​
For operations at our Don David Gold Mine, we have secured and continue to maintain various regulatory permits from federal, state, and local agencies. These governmental and regulatory permits generally govern the processes being used to operate, the stipulations concerning air quality and water issues, and the plans and obligations for reclamation of the properties at the conclusion of operations. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. 
​
Our production stage mines in Mexico have reclamation plans in place that we believe meet all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. As of December 31, 2021, $3.1 million has been accrued on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for reclamation costs relating to our production and exploration stage properties in Mexico.
The State of Michigan has been delegated authority under federal environmental law to issue all necessary environmental permits required for the Back Forty project. The State of Michigan’s “Natural Resource Environmental Protection Act” provides rules and regulations for the State Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) to issue permits for mining, treated wastewater discharge, air emissions and related environmental permits necessary for the project. Pending positive results from the definitive feasibility study, the company plans to submit all necessary permit applications in 2022.

Customers
​
During the year ended December 31, 2021, two customers accounted for 94% of our revenue from DDGM. In the event that our relationship with any of the customers is interrupted for any reason, we believe that we would be able to locate another entity to purchase our products in a timely manner on substantially similar terms. However, any interruption could temporarily disrupt the sale of our principal products and materially adversely affect our operating results. We periodically review our options for alternative sales outlets to mitigate the concentration of risk in case of any unforeseen disruptions.
​
Human Capital Resources
​
On April 23, 2021, a decree that reforms labor outsourcing in Mexico was published in the Federation’s Official Gazette. This new decree stipulated that operating companies will no longer be able to source the labor resources used to carry out their core business functions from service entities or third-party providers. Following this transition, DDGM employed approximately 530 employees during 2021. Under Mexican law, employees are entitled to receive statutory profit sharing (Participacion a los Trabajadores de las Utilidades or “PTU”) payments. PTU payments will total $1.9 million for 2021.
​
On December 10, 2021, we acquired six full-time employees through the Aquila Transaction. As of February 24, 2022, GRC has ten full-time employees, and three of them serve as our executive officers. These individuals devote all of their business time to GRC. 
​
We value excellence and recognize that embracing the diverse backgrounds, skills, and perspectives of the workforce will lead to a competitive advantage. We are committed to leading by example and to maintaining a fair and inclusive work environment that is built on mutual respect and integrity. Diversity means understanding, accepting, respecting, and valuing differences among people regardless of their age, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, religion or spiritual practices, disabilities, sexual orientation, gender identity, family status, or veteran status.
​
We believe we have good morale and a dedicated workforce. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing employees and new hires. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain, and motivate selected employees and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards that align employee compensation with shareholder returns.
