Corporate History
 
American International Holdings Corp.
 
American International Holdings Corp. was organized in 1986 and is incorporated in Nevada. The Company has undergone several name changes and changes of control since its incorporation; however, from 2012 until April 2019, the Company had no operations and nominal assets.
 
Prior to May 31, 2018, the Company was a 93.2% owned subsidiary of American International Industries, Inc. (“American”, “AMIN”), a company whose securities are traded on the OTCQB market maintained by OTC Markets under the symbol “AMIN”.
 
Effective on May 31, 2018, the Company issued (a) 4,300,000 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Daniel Dror (the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and President (who resigned from such positions effective on May 31, 2018)); (b) 3,800,000 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Robert Holden (who was appointed President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company on May 31, 2018 and resigned on August 20, 2018); (c) 750,000 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Everett Bassie (who was appointed as Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and a member of the board of directors of the Company on May 31, 2018, and who has since resigned from all positions with the Company); (d) 750,000 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Winfred Fields (a consultant to the Company); and (e) 500,000 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Charles R. Zeller (a then director of the Company), each in consideration for services rendered to the Company.
 
As a result of the issuance of the shares in May 2018 as discussed above, a change in control occurred. American International Industries, Inc. ownership decreased from 93.2% to 6.4%.
 
On April 12, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Novopelle Diamond, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Novopelle Diamond” and “Novopelle”) and certain unitholders of Novopelle Diamond. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Novopelle Diamond by means of a share exchange with the Novopelle Members in exchange for 18,000,000 newly issued shares of the common stock of the Company (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, Novopelle became a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company. The closing of the Share Exchange occurred concurrently with the entry into the Share Exchange Agreement and resulted in a change of control of the Company. As a result of the Share Exchange, the Company acquired the business of Novopelle Diamond and all of its assets. Novopelle Diamond is a physician supervised, medical spa and wellness clinic that offers a full menu of wellness services including anti-aging, weight loss and skin rejuvenation treatments.
 
The three unitholders of Novopelle Diamond who received shares pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement were (1) Jacob D. Cohen; (2) Esteban Alexander; and (3) Luis Alan Hernandez, who each received six million shares pursuant to the Share Exchange.
 
Concurrent with the Share Exchange, the Company entered into individual share exchange agreements and promissory notes with each of Daniel Dror, Winfred Fields and former directors Everett Bassie and Charles Zeller (the “AMIH Shareholders”) whereby the AMIH Shareholders agreed to cancel and exchange a total of 4,900,000 shares of their Company common stock for individual promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of $350,000 (the “Promissory Notes”). The Promissory Notes had a term of two years and accrue interest at the rate of 10% per annum (payable at maturity) until paid in full by the Company. The current principal balance of the Promissory Notes is approximately $110,000 as of the date of this filing.
 
As a result of the issuance of the shares in the Share Exchange and the cancellation of the shares held by the AMIH Shareholders, control of the Company changed to (1) Jacob D. Cohen; (2) Esteban Alexander; and (3) Alan Hernandez, who each owned 26% of the Company’s common stock following such transactions.
 
Also effective on April 12, 2019, the directors of the Company changed to Mr. Jacob D. Cohen; Mr. Esteban Alexander; and Mr. Alan Hernandez, who were also each appointed as the Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company (Mr. Cohen); the Chief Operating Officer and Treasurer (Mr. Alexander); and the Chief Marketing Officer and Secretary (Mr. Hernandez). Mr. Bassie resigned as a member of the board of directors of the Company and as the Secretary and Treasurer on April 12, 2019, but remained as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer until his passing on May 21, 2020.

On October 2, 2020, Jacob D. Cohen, the Chief Executive Officer and member of the board of directors of the Company entered into Stock Purchase Agreements with each of (a) Esteban Alexander, the Chief Operating Officer and member of the board of directors of the Company, and (b) Luis Alan Hernandez, the Chief Marketing Officer and member of the board of directors of the Company (collectively, the “Preferred Holders” and the “Stock Purchase Agreements”).
 
Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreements, Mr. Alexander agreed to sell 7,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company which he held to Mr. Cohen, which rights to such shares were assigned by Mr. Cohen to Cohen Enterprises, Inc., which entity he controls (“Cohen Enterprises”), in consideration for an aggregate of $1,500 as well as for the amount of services provided by Mr. Cohen to the Company; and Mr. Hernandez agreed to sell 4,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company which he held to Cohen Enterprises, in consideration for an aggregate of $1,000 as well as for the amount of services provided by Mr. Cohen to the Company. The sales closed on November 5, 2020.
 
One of the reasons that Mr. Alexander and Mr. Hernandez agreed to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreements (including the sale of the shares of common stock of the Company at below market value), is because (a) each of Mr. Cohen, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Hernandez were all appointed as officers and directors of the Company at the same time in April 2019, with the intention that such persons would provide a relatively equal amount of services to the Company in the roles as officers and directors thereof; (b) since such appointment date Mr. Cohen has been required to provide a disproportionate amount of services to the Company; and (c) each of Mr. Alexander and Mr. Hernandez desired to provide additional consideration to Mr. Cohen for such disproportionate level of service.
 
A condition to the Stock Purchase Agreements was that each of Mr. Alexander and Mr. Hernandez resign as a member of the board of directors of the Company by no later than January 15, 2021, which resignations were effective December 15, 2020.
 
A further requirement to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreements was that each of Mr. Alexander and Mr. Hernandez take such actions necessary and which may be requested from time to time by Mr. Cohen, to affect the cancellation of the one share of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company held by each of them, for no consideration (including, but not limited to, without the required payment by the Company of the $1 redemption price described in the designation of such Series A Preferred Stock).
 
The shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by Mr. Alexander and Mr. Hernandez were canceled on November 6, 2020. The common shares were also transferred to Mr. Cohen on November 6, 2020, and as such, a change of control occurred on such date, with Mr. Cohen taking over voting control of the Company, and serving between December 15, 2020 and October 19, 2021, as the sole officer and director of the Company. The Company has subsequently appointed new directors and a Chief Financial Officer, as discussed in greater detail below.
 
Overview
 
The Company is headquartered in Plano, Texas, and is an investor, developer and asset manager with diversified assets across the healthcare supply chain. The Company’s portfolio encompasses telemedicine and other virtual health platforms, subscriber based primary care and concierge medicine plans, preventative care solutions and wellness related assets such as mental and behavioral health services, as well as its own proprietary life coaching platform. The Company provides its various services through direct-to-consumer and business-to-business distribution channels and is focused on developing, acquiring and bringing to market technologies and solutions that we believe can advance the quality of life for the global community. Additionally, the Company seeks opportunities to acquire and grow businesses that possess strong brand values and that can generate long-term sustainable free cash flow and attractive returns in order to maximize value for all stakeholders.

Corporate Structure
 
The Company currently is the parent to ten subsidiaries, of which eight are wholly-owned subsidiaries and two (2) are majority-owned subsidiaries. In 2021, the Company ceased operations of five of its ten subsidiaries in order to focus on the subsidiaries that better aligned with the purpose of the Company and its ongoing business plan. The following diagram represents our corporate structure and the subsidiaries that we consolidate:
ZIPDOCTOR, INC. – 100% OWNED
 
On April 28, 2020, the Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, ZipDoctor, Inc. (“ZipDoctor”) in the state of Texas. ZipDoctor launched its online, direct-to-consumer subscription-based telemedicine platform www.ZipDoctor.co in the third quarter of 2020. ZipDoctor provides its customers with unlimited, 24/7 access to board certified physicians and licensed mental and behavioral health counselors and therapists via a newly developed, monthly subscription-based online telemedicine platform. ZipDoctor’s online telemedicine platform is available to customers across the United States and offers bilingual coverage (English and Spanish), with virtual visits taking place either via the phone or through a secured video chat platform. ZipDoctor customers subscribe through the website and are only required to pay a monthly fee, which is determined based on whether they are an individual, a couple, or a family. ZipDoctor is currently being sold on a direct-to-consumer basis, with an emphasis on digital marketing and advertising.
 
Digital Marketing Initiative: The ZipDoctor website was originally designed to be marketed and sold primarily using a digital and social media advertising campaign. Shortly after the website’s launch, ZipDoctor began to advertise on Google pay per click (PPC), search engine optimization (SEO), Facebook and Instagram. Shortly after launching, the Company decided to shift the focus of its marketing to a direct sales approach, resulting in the formation and launch of EPIQ MD, Inc. (discussed below).
 
Going Forward Strategy: With EPIQ MD, Inc. taking over the sales and marketing of the direct-to-consumer telemedicine platform, ZipDoctor has changed its business plan to focus on developing customized telemedicine solutions for niche, or specialty care, areas of medicine.
 
Telemedicine Platform Provider for Pharmacies. ZipDoctor is targeting relationships with specialty compound pharmacies seeking both an online telemedicine platform and a network of doctors to assist in facilitating patient online visits and to streamline the medical intake, patient demographics, health insurance verifications and overall prescription process. In exchange, ZipDoctor expects to receive a monthly fee on a per-patient per month basis for this customized access to the telemedicine platform. The initial focus is on Texas based pharmacies, however, if successful in Texas, ZipDoctor plans to expand its customized telemedicine solution to pharmacies across the United States, funding permitting.
 
On August 15, 2021, ZipDoctor entered into a Telemedicine Services Agreement (the “Services Agreement”) with Murphy RX, LLC (“Murphy”), a Texas-based specialty pharmacy, which has since ceased operations as of January 31, 2022. Pursuant to the Services Agreement, ZipDoctor agreed to provide Murphy with access to its centralized technology platform, to collect and manage patient demographics, and access to telemedicine services. Murphy agreed to pay ZipDoctor a monthly fee on a per-patient basis for the use of the technology platform and for access to primary care telemedicine services. ZipDoctor also agreed to provide continued support for the ZipDoctor website through the term of the agreement. The Services Agreement is no longer in effect, as Murphy ceased operations effective as of January 31, 2022.
 
As of the date of this Report, ZipDoctor has approximately 100 total members subscribed to its subscription-based telemedicine platform at www.ZipDoctor.co. Monthly subscription payments range from $25/month to $45/month, depending on how many family members are included, and provide members with unlimited, 24/7 access to board certified physicians and licensed mental and behavioral health counselors and therapists.

EPIQ MD, INC. – 100% OWNED
 
On October 23, 2020, the Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, EPIQ MD, Inc. (“EPIQ MD”) in the state of Nevada. EPIQ MD is a direct-to-consumer, telemedicine and healthcare company targeting Americans who are uninsured or underinsured. The EPIQ MD service offering is a convergence of primary care telemedicine, preventative care services and wellness programs – under the EPIQ MD brand and on a single platform. EPIQ MD markets and sells its services direct to end-use consumers, as well as through business-to-business (B2B) efforts, by focusing on employers in the targeted industries.
Products & Services
 
EPIQ MD’s telemedical services revolve around three services (1) primary care, (2) mental health care, and (3) prevention. Using cloud-based software, EPIQ MD has been able to merge these services under a single platform.
 
Primary care with EPIQ MD connects users to board certified doctors and medical professionals who can treat most non-emergency conditions using telemedicine. Similarly, EPIQ MD’s mental health services connect users with licensed therapists and counselors. As for EPIQ MD’s preventive care, the Company is using data driven technologies (wearables and apps), nutritionist and lab services, to help attempt to mitigate chronic diseases and the risk factors associated with them. In the future, funding permitting, EPIQ MD plans to add in-home medical devices to record vital information, offering what we believe to be the ambit of services between patient and doctor via the use of EPIQ MD’s telemedicine platform.
 
EPIQ MD also provides its subscribers with an option to participate in two premium add-on services, EPIQ LUX and EPIQ Paws. EPIQ LUX provides subscribers with discounts to ancillary healthcare related services such as laboratory services, dental and vision discount plans, prescription drug discounts, and imaging services and EPIQ Paws provides subscribers with access to virtual consultations with licensed veterinarians.
 
As of the date of this Report, EPIQ MD has nominal subscribers as it is expanding its marketing initiatives. However, EPIQ MD is currently registered to do business and is being marketed in Alaska, Georgia, Illinois, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Nevada and Utah. To ensure the highest quality control, it plans to scale up its full-service coverage incrementally to all 50 U.S. states by year-end 2022, funding permitting.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
With approximately 30 million people uninsured in the United States (according to 2019 Congressional Budget Office estimates) and 45 percent of U.S. adults between ages of 19 and 64 being inadequately insured (according to a February 2019 Survey Brief by the Commonwealth Fund), and an estimated 530,000 families turning to bankruptcy each year due to medical expenses (according to a study published in the March 2019 American Public Journal of Health), the Company sees an opportunity to make a positive impact in the lives of these uninsured or underinsured people. We believe that this is the demographic that the healthcare system has abandoned, ignored and/or left behind and is what we believe to be a largely underserved group.
 
To grow its subscriber base, EPIQ MD has implemented its own direct-to-consumer distribution channel referred to as the “Ambassador Program”. The Ambassador Program is intended to allow social influencers, community leaders and entrepreneurial-minded sales agents to market and sell EPIQ MD’s services across the nation, on a commission-only basis.
 
Market Opportunity
 
As previously described above, with approximately 30 million people uninsured in the United States and 45 percent of U.S. adults between ages of 19 and 64 being inadequately insured, EPIQ MD believes that their service offerings will be instrumental in reaching these Americans and plans to reach this demographic through its own direct-to-consumer distribution channel, or Ambassador Program, and through its commercial division that will target small and medium sized businesses (SMB’s) and municipalities.

According to a 2020 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading industry research firm (“Key Facts About the Uninsured Population”), the high cost of insurance is one of the main reasons individuals lack coverage (in 2019, 73.7% of uninsured adults said they were uninsured because the cost of coverage was too high); and, individuals with income below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) are at the highest risk of being uninsured.
 
We see a significant opportunity to market to these uninsured and/or underinsured persons, and believe that our low-cost, flat rate, telemedical services can be an attractive alternative to those persons seeking lower cost health services.
 
LIFE GURU, INC. – 51% OWNED
 
On May 15, 2020, the Company acquired a 51% interest in Life Guru, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Life Guru”). Life Guru owns www.LifeGuru.me – a website dedicated to providing an online platform to connect consumers to a variety of mentors, professionals, life coaches and career coaches. Upon final launch of the platform, it will include functionality enabling: life coaches from around the world to access and subscribe to the Life Guru platform; and consumers to filter their life coach options by geographic location, language and even the type of currency they would like to pay with. While Life Guru is free to consumers, it generates revenues by charging monthly subscription fees to coaches participating on the platform. Further, and depending on the type of subscription plan the life coach chooses to participate in, Life Guru receives a percentage of the per session fees generated and earned between the consumer and the life coach.
 
Since the LifeGuru.me website was launched around March 2021, Life Guru has been working to optimize the website for mobile and completing integration with its merchant account provider to automate monthly payouts to coaches. LifeGuru is currently in the process of marketing and onboarding coaches onto the platform.
 
Industry Trends
 
Life coaching has been the second fastest growing industry in the world for over ten consecutive years, behind the information technology sector (according to a May 2016 article posted at Forbes.com). The global Personal Development Industry (including market segments from holistic approaches, motivational speakers, inspirational websites, personal coaching, and other forms of personal development) was valued at approximately $38.28 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.1% from 2020 to 2027 (according to a July 2020 report by Grand View Research). Moreover, Life Guru believes that improving social skills and focusing on critical areas for self-awareness, such as emotions, character traits, habits, individual values, and the psychological need that shapes the day-to-day behavior of individuals are gaining importance.
Operational, Technological & Cost Advantages
 
We anticipate that coaches that subscribe to the Life Guru platform will benefit from Life Guru’s investment in digital marketing and promotion, enabling them to reach customers and providing increased visibility. Life Guru has developed a proprietary technology platform for coaching online, as well as proprietary video conferencing capabilities for coaching interactively. Through our existing marketing partnerships, Life Guru believes it has access to sales tools which allow the effective marketing of coaches across all major social media platforms, including and most importantly, LinkedIn. LifeGuru.me is mobile-friendly and can run smoothly on many platforms, making it highly scalable.
Subscriptions
 
Life Guru offers free membership for all consumers to gain access to the site and search for life coaches. Life Guru’s model is to charge coaches, and not members, for the use of its services. The Company currently offers three different subscription levels to life coaches, with varying levels of promotion on the Life Guru site, prominence of search results, and commissions payable. As of the date of this Report, Life Guru has no members and approximately 200 total life coaches that have signed up and created profiles on the platform.

-

Growth Objectives
 
In addition to marketing Life Guru directly to consumers, Life Guru intends to implement packages to be sold to various businesses and corporations, which can, in turn, be marketed as a corporate benefit by employers. Life Guru calls this “Life Guru Corporate”. A recent survey of 256 companies by the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions, a nonprofit employer group, found that 53% of employers are providing special emotional and mental health programs for their workforce in the wake of the pandemic. Life Guru believes that Life Guru Corporate represents important potential upside in targeting the business and corporate world, and providing services to employees on an ongoing basis. Life Guru Corporate can only be developed once the platform has achieved a reputable brand and a substantial amount of high-quality business coaches are engaged, and Life Guru does not anticipate launching Life Guru Corporate with fewer than 200 life coaches, provided Life Guru’s projected milestones are met.
MANGOCEUTICALS, INC. – 100% OWNED
 
On October 7, 2021, the Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Mangoceuticals, Inc. (“Mangoceuticals”) in the state of Texas with the intent of focusing on developing, marketing and selling a variety of men’s wellness products and services via a telemedicine platform. To date, the Company has identified men’s wellness telemedicine services and products as a growing sector in the most recent years and especially related to the areas of erectile dysfunction and hair loss products. In this regard, Mangoceuticals is currently in the process of developing and preparing to market a new brand of erectile dysfunction (ED) products that delivers fast acting results through a proprietary combination of FDA approved ingredients.
 
Mangoceuticals plans to market and sell this new brand of ED products exclusively online and will require the use of a telemedicine visit, a doctor’s prescription and the fulfillment of the prescription by pharmacy licensed in the state in which the customer resides. Mangoceuticals plans to rely heavily on digital and social media marketing through channels such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snap Chat and TikTok and further has plans to use digital marketing with the goal of creating viral marketing campaigns, using social media influencers and celebrities, funding permitting.
 
Our goal is to eventually sell this new brand of ED products nationwide and to use EPIQ Scripts (described below) as its mail order pharmacy to fulfill the ED prescriptions. Mangoceuticals is currently in the branding and development stage of this ED product and anticipates a planned and limited launch in the Texas market in the second quarter of 2022 with the intent of expanding its marketing initiatives at a pace in which Epiq Scripts obtains additional state licenses across the United States.
 
EPIQ SCRIPTS, LLC – 51% OWNED
 
On January 24, 2022, the Company formed EPIQ Scripts, LLC (“EPIQ Scripts”) in the state of Texas. EPIQ Scripts has been established with the intent of operating as a close-door online mail order pharmacy with a specific target and vision to obtain licenses in all 50 states across the U.S., of which no state licenses have been obtained as of the date of this Report. EPIQ Scripts also plans to seek to become accredited with the most respected and highly recognized authorities in the industry, such as Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC), Legit Script, Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC), and National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) Digital Pharmacy. EPIQ Scripts also intends to obtain in-network contracts with all major Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBM) and insurance payors.
Market Opportunity
 
It is anticipated that if licenses, accreditations and in-network contracts are secured in all 50 U.S. states, EPIQ Scripts will be able to market itself to the many up and coming telemedicine companies that have been on the rise since early 2020. Pursuant to a July 9, 2021 article published by McKinsey & Company, according to a study taken by McKinsey & Company, in April 2020, overall telehealth utilization for office visits and outpatient care was 78 times higher than in February 2020. Even though telemedicine use has now leveled off as in-person visits have returned, McKinsey & Company is still consistently seeing use that is 38 times higher than pre-pandemic numbers. Furthermore, a majority of Americans have now tried out telehealth. According to an article published at Sykes.com, a March 2021 survey of 2,000 U.S. adults undertaken by Sykes.com found that by March 2021, more than 61% of such surveyed individuals had made a telehealth/telemedicine appointment, which is a massive increase from just 19.5% a year prior, according to Sykes. We further believe that telemedicine use is now widespread across demographics.

--


We believe the significant increases in demand for telemedicine has created a vacuum for pharmacies that have the capabilities to handle the prescription volume generated by these platforms. We believe that EPIQ Scripts’ planned mail order pharmacy, which is expected to have advanced API capabilities and infrastructure and be supported with nationwide licenses and accreditations can position itself to capitalize on the current market opportunity.
 
EPIQ Scripts has currently filed with the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC) to obtain its pharmacy accreditation and is in the process of obtaining its first state license in the State of Texas, which it anticipates receiving in April 2022. Once the Texas state license is obtained, EPIQ Scripts will be able to apply for additional state licenses until they have obtained all 50 state licenses, with some state licenses easier to obtain and quicker to obtain than others. EPIQ Scripts intends to have licenses to operate in all 50 states by the first quarter of 2023.
 
* * * * * *
 
The Company intends to continue to grow its business both organically and through identifying acquisition targets over the next 12 months in the telemedicine, life coaching and wellness space, funding permitting. As these opportunities arise, the Company will determine the best method for financing its growth which may include the issuance of additional debt instruments, common stock, preferred stock, or a combination thereof, any one or more of which may cause significant dilution to existing shareholders. The Company requires approximately $5 million to implement its current business strategy for its different subsidiaries and to support potential growth. We expect to raise funds in the future through the sale of debt and/or equity in order to allow us to operate for the next twelve months, and may need to raise further additional capital in order to expedite our growth through acquisitions, none of which are currently planned. There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising such funds and if we do raise funds, this may result in substantial dilution to current investors.
 
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS:
 
MEDICAL SPA AND WELLNESS
 
The Company previously operated three wholly-owned subsidiaries that were in the Medical Spa and Wellness Sector (collectively hereinafter referred to as “MedSpa”, or “VISSIA”), the operations of which were discontinued in October 2020:

1. | VISSIA MCKINNEY, LLC (F/K/A NOVOPELLE DIAMOND, LLC) – 100% OWNED 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 
VISSIA McKinney was a physician supervised, medical spa and wellness clinic that offered a full menu of wellness services including anti-aging, weight loss and skin rejuvenation treatments and was located at 5000 Collin McKinney Parkway, Suite 150, McKinney, Texas 75070.
 

2. | VISSIA WATERWAY, INC. (F/K/A NOVOPELLE WATERWAY, INC.) – 100% OWNED 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
VISSIA McKinney was a physician supervised, medical spa and wellness clinic that offered a full menu of wellness services including anti-aging, weight loss and skin rejuvenation treatments and was located at 25 Waterway, Suite 150, The Woodlands, Texas.

3. | NOVOPELLE TYLER, INC. – 100% OWNED 
---+---------------------------------------

 
On December 3, 2019, the Company formed and organized Novopelle Tyler, Inc. in the State of Texas with the plan to come to terms on a retail location for a new med spa to be located in Tyler, Texas. The Company no longer intends to open this location and no activity has been performed under this entity to date.
 
* * * * *
 
As a result of COVID-19 and ‘stay-at-home’ and social distancing orders issued in McKinney and The Woodlands, Texas, we had to close both of our then operational MedSpas, VISSIA McKinney and VISSIA Waterway, Inc., effective March 10, 2020, and which resulted in both the loss of income and the loss of substantially all of our MedSpa employees, who had to be let go. VISSIA Waterway, Inc. reopened effective June 21, 2020 and VISSIA McKinney reopened effective August 8, 2020. However, due to the termination of employees associated with the shutdown we were forced to expend resources to attract, hire and train completely new staff for preparation of the re-launchings. Notwithstanding the re-openings, customer traffic and demand at our VISSIA Waterway, Inc. and VISSIA McKinney MedSpa locations failed to rebound to pre-COVID-19 levels due to COVID-19 and the pandemic’s effects on the economy, and because we were unable to predict the length of the pandemic or ultimate outcome thereof, and further due to our limited capital resources, effective on October 25, 2020, we made the decision to close both our VISSIA Waterway, Inc. and VISSIA McKinney locations. Our former MedSpa operations and assets are included under discontinued operations in the statement of operations and balance sheet included herein for the year ended December 31, 2021 and for the year ended, December 31, 2020.
 

4. | CAPITOL CITY SOLUTIONS, USA, INC. – 100% OWNED 
---+---------------------------------------------------

 
On September 17, 2019, the Company formed and organized Capitol City Solutions USA, Inc. (“CCS”) in the State of Texas to act as a general contracting and construction company focused on the remodeling, general construction and interior finish of both the Company’s then MedSpa locations (which have since been closed) as well as to market to other commercial real estate projects within the United States. The Company made the decision to cease any further construction-based operations under CCS in July 2021, in order to focus on the subsidiaries that better aligned with the purpose of the Company and its ongoing business plan in the telehealth and wellness space.
 

5. | LEGEND NUTRITION, INC. – 100% OWNED 
---+----------------------------------------

 
On September 23, 2019, the Company formed and organized Legend Nutrition, Inc. (“Legend Nutrition”) in the State of Texas to act as a new brand of retail vitamin and supplement stores to be branded and marketed as Legend Nutrition. October 18, 2019, Legend entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire all of the assets associated with and related to a retail vitamin, supplements and nutrition store located in McKinney, Texas and previously identified and doing business as “Ideal Nutrition.” Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, Legend purchased a variety of assets including software, contracts, bank and merchant accounts, products, inventory, computers, security systems and other intellectual properties. As Legend Nutrition’s lease expired in January 2021, the Company made the decision to cease its operations to focus on the subsidiaries that better aligned with the purpose of the Company and its ongoing business plan in the telehealth and wellness space.

COVID-19 Outlook and Discontinued Operations
 
The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”), which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, and the related responses by public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat its outbreak and spread has severely impacted the U.S. and world economies, the market for health spa services, nutrition supplements and our other business offerings during the end of the first quarter of 2020, and continuing through the end of 2020 and into 2021. Government mandated ‘stay-at-home’ and similar orders have to date, and may in the future, prevent us from operating. In late 2020, we made the decision to discontinue operations of our VISSIA Waterway, Inc. and VISSIA McKinney MedSpa locations, due to declines in customers and issues staffing such facilities, each as a result of the pandemic. Additionally, our Legend Nutrition store saw a deep decline in sales due to social distancing orders and decreases in customers who are willing to venture out to brick-and-mortar establishments. Legend Nutrition’s lease was up January 31, 2021, and the Company chose to not renew the lease, closed the store, and will not continue in this line of business moving forward. We also decided to cease offering construction services around July 2021.
 
As of the date of this Report, our operations are limited, and consist solely of ZipDoctor, Inc., Life Guru, Inc., EPIQ MD, Inc, Mangoceuticals, Inc., and EPIQ Scripts, LLC.
 
Moving forward, economic recessions, including those brought on by the continued COVID-19 outbreak, geopolitical events, including the current military conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, inflationary pressures, or other events, may have a negative effect on the demand for our services and our operating results. Any prolonged disruption to our operations or work force available is likely to have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and ability to meet continuing debt service requirements. All of the above may be exacerbated in the future as the COVID-19 outbreak and the governmental responses thereto continues.
 
Recent Events:
 
On October 7, 2021, the Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Mangoceuticals, Inc. in the state of Texas with the intent of focusing on developing, marketing and selling a variety of men’s wellness products and services via a telemedicine platform. To date, the Company has identified men’s wellness telemedicine services and products as a growing sector in the most recent years and especially related to the areas of erectile dysfunction and hair loss products. In this regard, Mangoceuticals is currently in the process of developing and preparing to market a new brand of erectile dysfunction (ED) products that delivers fast acting results through a proprietary combination of FDA approved ingredients.
 
Between November 22, 2021 and December 2, 2021, we entered into four separate Securities Purchase Agreements (collectively, the “Purchase Agreements”) with four accredited institutional investors (collectively, the “Investors”), for the sale of convertible promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000 (collectively, the “Notes”) and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 13,333,332 shares of the Company’s common stock (collectively, the “Warrants”). The Purchase Agreements, Notes, and Warrants are collectively referred to as the “Transaction Documents”). The Company and the Investors closed the sale of the Notes and Warrants between November 23, 2021 and December 3, 2021. Gross proceeds of $1,800,000 were raised through the sale of the Notes and Warrants.
 
J.H. Darbie & Co., Inc. acted as placement agent for the offering and was paid a total of $188,000 in placement agent fees of which $98,000 was paid in cash and $90,000 was paid in the form of 1,151,678 shares of restricted common stock issued by the Company between November 22, 2021 and December 3, 2021.

Reverse Stock Split
 
We have applied to list our common stock and certain warrants to purchase common stock which we plan to sell in the future in a public offering, on the NASDAQ Capital Market; however, our application to uplist our common stock and certain warrants on the NASDAQ Capital Market may not be approved and our securities may never trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market.
 
On July 30, 2021, our board of directors, and on July 30, 2021, stockholders holding a majority of our outstanding voting shares, approved resolutions authorizing a reverse stock split of the outstanding shares of our common stock in the range from one-for-two (1-for-2) to one-for-sixty (1-for-60), and provided authority to our board of directors to select the ratio of the reverse stock split in their discretion, at any time prior to the earlier of July 30, 2022 and the date of our 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. On January 25, 2022, our board of directors, pursuant to such shareholder authority, approved a one-for-sixty (1-for-60) reverse stock split of the outstanding shares of our common stock, which is intended to allow us to meet the minimum share price requirement of the NASDAQ Capital Market. Notwithstanding such board of directors approval, the reverse stock split is subject to approval thereof by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), which approval has not been received yet, and may not be received on a timely basis, if at all. The board of directors approved the reverse stock split in an effort to increase the trading price of the Company’s common stock to a level sufficient to allow an uplisting of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Because FINRA has not yet approved the reverse stock split and the Company has not formally affected the reverse stock split, none of the outstanding share amounts set forth below have been adjusted for such board of directors approved reverse stock split. The board of directors reserves the right to adjust the ratio of the reverse stock split and/or terminate the authority for such reverse stock split in the future.
