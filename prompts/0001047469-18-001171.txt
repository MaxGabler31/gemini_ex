     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
  Overview 
         Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to "Halcón," "our," "us," and "we" refer to Halcón Resources Corporation and its subsidiaries, as a common entity.
         Prior year financial statements are not comparable to our current year financial statements due to the adoption of fresh-start accounting. References to "Successor" or "Successor Company" relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to September 9, 2016. References to "Predecessor" or "Predecessor Company" relate to the financial position and results of operations of the Company prior to, and including, September 9, 2016.
         We are an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, production, exploration and development of onshore liquids-rich oil and natural gas assets in the United States. As discussed below in more detail under "Recent Developments," we recently acquired certain properties in the Delaware Basin and divested our assets located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota and in the El Halcón area of East Texas. As a result, our properties and drilling activities are currently focused in the Delaware Basin, where we have an extensive drilling inventory that we believe offers more attractive economics. The Williston Divestiture discussed under "Recent Developments," improved our liquidity and significantly reduced our debt, better enabling us to accelerate development of our Delaware Basin properties and execute our growth plans in the basin. At December 31, 2017, our estimated total proved oil and natural gas reserves, as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firm, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (Netherland, Sewell) using the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prices for crude oil and natural gas, which are based on the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil spot price of $51.34 per Bbl and Henry Hub natural gas spot price of $2.976 per MMBtu, were approximately 51.1 MMBoe, consisting of 34.1 MMBbls of oil, 9.2 MMBbls of natural gas liquids, and 46.7 Bcf of natural gas. Approximately 31% of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed as of December 31, 2017. We maintain operational control of approximately 99% of our proved reserves. Substantially all of our proved reserves and production at December 31, 2017 are associated with our Delaware Basin properties. 
         Our total operating revenues for 2017 were approximately $378.0 million, compared to total operating revenues for the period of September 10, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and the period of January 1, 2016 through September 9, 2016 of approximately $153.4 million and $266.8 million, respectively, or $420.2 million combined. Full year 2017 production averaged 27,397 Boe/d. During the period of September 10, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and the period of January 1, 2016 through September 9, 2016, production averaged 37,637 Boe/d and 36,787 Boe/d, respectively, or 37,049 Boe/d combined. The decrease in total operating revenues and average daily production year over year was driven by our divestitures in 2017. In 2017, we participated in the drilling of 124 gross (33.7 net) wells, none of which were dry holes. 
   Recent Developments 
   Pending Acquisition of West Quito Draw Properties 
         On February 6, 2018, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Shell PSA) with SWEPI LP (Shell), an affiliate of Shell Oil Company, pursuant to which we agreed to purchase an aggregate 10,524 net acres and related assets in the Southern Delaware Basin located in Ward County, Texas (the West Quito Draw Properties) for a total purchase price of $200.0 million. The effective date of the proposed acquisition is February 1, 2018, and we expect the closing date to occur in early April 2018. 
 7

           The purchase price is subject to adjustments for (i) operating expenses, capital expenditures and revenues between the effective date and the closing date, (ii) title and environmental defects, and (iii) other purchase price adjustments customary in oil and gas purchase and sale agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the Shell PSA, we paid a deposit into escrow totaling $20.0 million, which amount will be applied to the purchase price if the transaction closes. The completion of the acquisition of the West Quito Draw Properties is subject to customary closing conditions. Either party may terminate the Shell PSA if certain closing conditions have not been satisfied, or if the transaction has not closed on or before April 20, 2018. If one or more of the closing conditions are not satisfied, or if the transaction is otherwise terminated, the acquisition may not be completed. Our escrow deposit with Shell is refundable only in specified circumstances if the transaction is not consummated. 
         Each party makes customary representations and warranties in the Shell PSA for transactions of this type. The Shell PSA also includes customary covenants relating to the operation of the West Quito Draw Properties prior to the closing date and other matters. The parties have agreed to indemnify one another for breaches of their respective representations and warranties, as well as the operation of the West Quito Draw Properties prior to (in the case of the Shell) and after (in the case of us) the closing date. Indemnities for breaches of representations and warranties, and any purchase price adjustments attributable to title or environmental defects, are subject to certain threshold limitations. Specifically, indemnification claims are subject to an individual claim threshold of $50,000, and Shell is required to indemnify us for claims totaling in excess of 2% of the purchase price, or $4.0 million. Our right to indemnification in certain circumstances is subject to a cap equal to 15% of the purchase price, or $30.0 million. The total amount of uncured title defect claims or unremedied environmental claims must be more than 1.5% of the purchase price, or $3.0 million, respectively, before we will be entitled to a downward adjustment to the purchase price consideration for either type of claim. 
         We intend to fund the cash consideration for the acquisition of the West Quito Draw Properties with the net proceeds from our recent issuance of Additional 2025 Notes and common stock, discussed below. There can be no assurance that we will acquire the West Quito Draw Properties on the terms or timing described herein or at all, or close without material adjustments. Even if we consummate the acquisition of the West Quito Draw Properties, we may not be able to achieve the benefits we expect from it. If we do not consummate the acquisition of the West Quito Draw Properties, we intend to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the Additional 2025 Notes and common stock for general corporate purposes, including to fund our 2018 drilling program. 
   Issuance of Additional 2025 Notes 
         On February 15, 2018, we issued an additional $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Notes (defined below) at a price to the initial purchasers of 103.0% of par (the Additional 2025 Notes). The net proceeds from the sale of the Additional 2025 Notes were approximately $203.0 million after deducting initial purchasers' premiums, commissions and estimated offering expenses. These notes were issued under the Indenture, dated as of February 16, 2017, among us, certain of our subsidiaries and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, which governs our 6.75% senior notes due 2025 that were issued on February 16, 2017 (the 2025 Notes). 
         The Additional 2025 Notes are treated as a single class with, and have the same terms as, the 2025 Notes, except that the Additional 2025 Notes will initially be subject to transfer restrictions and have the benefit of certain registration rights and provisions for the payment of additional interest in the event of a breach with respect to such registration rights pursuant to the terms of a Registration Rights Agreement, entered into on February 15, 2018 between us and J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC on behalf of itself and the initial purchasers of the Additional 2025 Notes. The Additional 2025 Notes were issued in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. 
 8

     Issuance of Common Stock 
         On February 9, 2018, we sold 9.2 million shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, in a public offering at a price of $6.90 per share. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $60.8 million, after deducting underwriters' discounts and estimated offering expenses. 
 Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement 
         On September 7, 2017, we entered into the Senior Credit Agreement by and among us, as borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain other financial institutions party thereto, as lenders. The Senior Credit Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the original Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement entered into on September 9, 2016. Pursuant to the Senior Credit Agreement, the lenders party thereto have agreed to provide us with a $1.0 billion senior secured reserve-based revolving credit facility with a current borrowing base of $100.0 million. The maturity date of the Senior Credit Agreement is September 7, 2022. The borrowing base will be redetermined semi-annually, with the lenders and us each having the right to one interim unscheduled redetermination between any two consecutive semi-annual redeterminations. The next scheduled redetermination date is May 2018. The borrowing base takes into account the estimated value of our oil and natural gas properties, proved reserves, total indebtedness, and other relevant factors consistent with customary oil and natural gas lending criteria. Amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Agreement bear interest at specified margins over the base rate of 1.25% to 2.25% for ABR-based loans or at specified margins over LIBOR of 2.25% to 3.25% for Eurodollar-based loans. These margins fluctuate based on our utilization of the facility. 
         On February 2, 2018, we entered into the Second Amendment (the Second Amendment) to the Senior Credit Agreement which among other things, for certain fiscal quarters in 2018, provided flexibility with respect to certain financial covenants as specified in the Senior Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment provides for (i) the use of annualized financial data in determining EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2018, September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018, (ii) an increase in the ratio of our Consolidated Total Net Debt (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) to EBITDA of 4.50:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2018, and a ratio of 4.00:1.00 for any fiscal quarter thereafter, (iii) a waiver of compliance with the covenant relating to the Total Net Indebtedness Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2018, and (iv) a waiver of the automatic reduction to the borrowing base that would otherwise have resulted from our issuance of the Additional 2025 Notes. The Senior Credit Agreement also contains a financial covenant to maintain a Current Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) not to be less than 1.00:1.00. 
   Recent Acquisition of Additional Properties in Monument Draw (Ward and Winkler Counties, Texas) 
         On December 13, 2017, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries acquired 4,093 net acres and related assets in the Delaware Basin in an area contiguous to the western and southern areas of our existing Monument Draw properties in Ward County, Texas (the Additional Monument Draw Properties) from a private company for a total purchase price of approximately $101.6 million. The effective date of the acquisition was September 1, 2017. We estimate that at the time of acquisition the Additional Monument Draw Properties include a 88% average working interest, with approximately 99% held by production. 
 Divestiture of Williston Basin Non-Operated Assets 
         On September 19, 2017, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into an agreement with a privately-owned company pursuant to which we sold our non-operated properties and related assets located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana (the Non-Operated Williston Assets) for a 
 9

   total adjusted sales price of approximately $105.2 million, before certain closing adjustments as provided for in the sales agreement. The effective date of the transaction was April 1, 2017 and the transaction closed on November 9, 2017. Estimated proved reserves associated with the Non-Operated Williston Assets were approximately 7.4 MMBoe, or approximately 5% of our year-end 2016 proved reserves. The Non-Operated Williston Assets generated net production of approximately 2,500 Boe/d, or approximately 7% of our average daily production for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Upon closing of the sale of the Non-Operated Williston Assets, the borrowing base on our Senior Credit Agreement was reduced from $140.0 million to $100.0 million. 
   Divestiture of Williston Basin Operated Assets 
         On July 10, 2017, we and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into an agreement with Bruin Williston Holdings, LLC pursuant to which we sold all of our operated oil and natural gas leases, oil and natural gas wells and related assets in the Williston Basin in North Dakota, as well as 100% of the membership interests in two of our subsidiaries (the Williston Assets) for a total cash sales price of approximately $1.4 billion, before certain closing adjustments as provided for in the sales agreement (the Williston Divestiture). The effective date of the Williston Divestiture was June 1, 2017, and we closed the transaction on September 7, 2017. Estimated proved reserves associated with the Williston Assets were approximately 104.9 MMBoe, or approximately 71% of our year-end 2016 proved reserves. The Williston Assets generated net production of approximately 26,180 Boe/d, or approximately 76% of our average daily production for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. We used the proceeds from the Williston Divestiture to repay borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Agreement, repurchase approximately $425.0 million principal amount (or one-half) of our 6.75% senior notes due 2025, and redeem all of our outstanding 12% senior secured second lien notes, as well as for general corporate purposes. 
 Repurchase of 2025 Notes 
         On September 7, 2017, we commenced an offer to purchase for cash up to $425.0 million of the $850.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Notes at 103.0% of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest, up to, but not including, the date of purchase. Pursuant to the indenture governing the 2025 Notes, we were required to make an offer to all holders of the 2025 Notes to purchase for cash an aggregate principal amount up to $425.0 million of the notes as a consequence of the Williston Divestiture. The offer to purchase expired on October 6, 2017, with holders having tendered such notes representing in excess of $425.0 million of principal amount. Accordingly, on October 10, 2017, we completed the repurchase of approximately $425.0 million principal amount of the 2025 Notes on a pro rata basis at 103.0% of par plus accrued and unpaid interest, up to, but not including, the date of purchase of approximately $4.1 million. 
 Redemption of 2022 Second Lien Notes 
         Using a portion of the net proceeds from the Williston Divestiture, on October 7, 2017 (the Redemption Date), we fully redeemed $112.8 million aggregate principal amount constituting all of our outstanding 12.0% senior secured second lien notes due 2022 (the 2022 Second Lien Notes). We redeemed the 2022 Second Lien Notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus a make whole premium of approximately $23.0 million, together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Redemption Date of approximately $2.0 million. 
         Both the redemption of the 2022 Second Lien Notes and the repurchase of the 2025 Notes, discussed above, were required under the indentures governing such notes. 
 10

     Issuance of 2025 Notes and Repurchase of 2020 Second Lien Notes 
         On February 16, 2017, we issued $850.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Notes in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S, and applicable state securities laws. The 2025 Notes were issued at par and bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per annum, payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2017. Proceeds from the private placement were approximately $834.1 million after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and offering expenses. We used a portion of the net proceeds to fund the repurchase and redemption of our outstanding 8.625% senior secured second lien notes due 2020 (the 2020 Second Lien Notes), discussed further below, and for general corporate purposes. 
         On February 9, 2017, we commenced a cash tender offer for any and all of our 2020 Second Lien Notes and on the expiration thereof, being February 15, 2017, having received approximately $289.2 million or 41% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of 2020 Second Lien Notes which were validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn), on February 16, 2017, we paid approximately $303.5 million for approximately $289.2 million principal amount of 2020 Second Lien Notes, a make-whole premium of $13.2 million plus accrued and unpaid interest of approximately $1.1 million to repurchase such notes. For all of the 2020 Second Lien Notes that remained outstanding, on February 16, 2017, we issued a redemption notice to holders of the remaining 2020 Second Lien Notes. On February 21, 2017, we paid approximately $1.2 million for approximately $1.2 million of principal amount of 2020 Second Lien Notes, a make-whole premium of approximately $54,000 plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date to redeem such notes pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures. On March 20, 2017, we paid approximately $432.0 million for $409.6 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Second Lien Notes outstanding, a make-whole premium of $17.7 million and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date of approximately $4.8 million to redeem the remaining notes at a price of 104.313% of the principal amount. 
   Divestiture of East Texas Eagle Ford Assets 
         On January 24, 2017, certain of our subsidiaries entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Hawkwood Energy, LLC (Hawkwood) for the sale of all of our oil and natural gas properties and related assets located in the Eagle Ford formation of East Texas (the El Halcón Assets) for a total adjusted sales price of $491.1 million (the El Halcón Divestiture). The effective date of the El Halcón Divestiture was January 1, 2017, and the transaction closed on March 9, 2017. We used the net proceeds from the sale to repay amounts outstanding under our Senior Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes. The El Halcón Assets included approximately 80,500 net acres prospective for the Eagle Ford formation in East Texas. As of December 31, 2016, estimated proved reserves from the El Halcón Assets were approximately 35.1 MMBoe, or 24% of our estimated year-end 2016 proved reserves. The Halcón Assets generated net production of approximately 7,600 Boe/d (80% oil) for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
 Private Placement of Automatically Convertible Preferred Stock 
         On January 24, 2017, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with certain accredited investors to sell, in a private placement exempt from registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(a)(2), approximately 5,518 shares of 8% Automatically Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Preferred Stock), each share of which was convertible into 10,000 shares of common stock. Also on January 24, 2017, we received an executed written consent in lieu of a stockholders' meeting authorizing and approving the conversion of the Preferred Stock into common stock. On February 27, 2017, we filed with the Delaware Secretary of State a Certificate of Designation, Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Preferred Stock (the Certificate of Designation), which created the series of preferred stock issued by us on that same date. We issued the Preferred Stock at 
 11

   $72,500 per share. Gross proceeds were approximately $400.1 million, or $7.25 per share of common stock. We incurred approximately $11.9 million in expenses associated with this offering, including placement agent fees. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the Preferred Stock to partially fund the Pecos County Acquisition, which is discussed further below. 
         On March 16, 2017, we mailed a definitive information statement to stockholders of record notifying them that a majority of our stockholders approved the issuance of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and upon the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock, we issued 55.2 million shares of common stock on April 6, 2017 in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation. No cash dividends were paid on the Preferred Stock since, pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designation, conversion occurred prior to June 1, 2017. 
         In accordance with the stock purchase agreement, we agreed to file a registration statement to register the resale of the shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock and to pay penalties in the event such registration was not effective by June 27, 2017. We filed such registration statement on March 3, 2017 and it was declared effective by the SEC on April 7, 2017. 
   Acquisition of Hackberry Draw Assets (Pecos and Reeves Counties, Texas) 
         On January 18, 2017, we entered into an agreement with Samson Exploration, LLC (Samson), pursuant to which we acquired a total of 20,901 net acres and related assets in the Hackberry Draw area of the Delaware Basin, located in Pecos and Reeves Counties, Texas (collectively, the Pecos County Assets), for a total purchase price of $699.2 million (the Pecos County Acquisition). The effective date of the Pecos County Acquisition was November 1, 2016, and we closed the transaction on February 28, 2017. Based on information provided by Samson, we estimate that net production from the Pecos County Assets at the acquisition date was approximately 2,200 Boe/d (72% oil, 15% NGLs, 13% natural gas). As of the acquisition date, we estimate that the Pecos County Assets included a 75% average working interest, with approximately 44% held by production. We funded the Pecos County Acquisition with net proceeds from the private placement of the Preferred Stock and borrowings under our Senior Credit Agreement. 
 Option Agreement to Acquire Monument Draw Assets (Ward and Winkler Counties, Texas) 
         On December 9, 2016, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into an agreement with a private company, pursuant to which we acquired the rights to purchase up to 15,040 net acres in the Monument Draw area of the Delaware Basin, located in Ward and Winkler Counties, Texas (the Ward County Assets) prospective for the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring formations. The Ward County Assets are divided into two tracts (the Southern Tract and Northern Tract) with separate options for each tract. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement (as amended), on June 15, 2017, we purchased the Southern Tract acreage for approximately $87.4 million and on January 9, 2018, we purchased the Northern Tract acreage for approximately $108.2 million. Each of the Southern Tract and Northern Tract are 100% operated and have an average working interest of 100%. 
 Reorganization 
         On July 27, 2016, we and certain of our subsidiaries (the Halcón Entities) filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the District of Delaware (the Bankruptcy Court) to pursue a prepackaged plan of reorganization in accordance with the terms of the Restructuring Support Agreement discussed below. Prior to filing the chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions, on June 9, 2016, the Halcón Entities entered into a restructuring support agreement (the Restructuring Support Agreement) with certain holders of our 13% senior secured third lien notes due 2022 (the Third Lien Noteholders), our 8.875% senior unsecured notes due 2021, 9.25% senior unsecured notes due 2022 and 9.75% senior unsecured notes due 2020 
 12

   (collectively, the Unsecured Noteholders), the holder of our 8% senior unsecured convertible note due 2020 (the Convertible Noteholder), and certain holders of our 5.75% Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the Preferred Holders), to support a restructuring in accordance with the terms of a plan of reorganization as described therein (the Plan). On September 8, 2016, the Halcón Entities received confirmation of their joint prepackaged plan of reorganization from the Bankruptcy Court and subsequently emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 9, 2016 (the Effective Date). Refer to Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 2, "Reorganization," for further details. 
   Fresh-start Accounting 
         Upon our emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy, on September 9, 2016, we adopted fresh-start accounting in accordance with the provisions set forth in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 852, Reorganizations, as (i) the Reorganization Value of our assets immediately prior to the date of confirmation was less than the post-petition liabilities and allowed claims and (ii) the holders of our existing voting shares of the Predecessor entity received less than 50% of the voting shares of the emerging entity. 
         Adopting fresh-start accounting results in a new financial reporting entity with no beginning or ending retained earnings or deficit balances as of the fresh-start reporting date. Upon the adoption of fresh-start accounting, our assets and liabilities were recorded at their fair values as of the fresh-start reporting date. Our adoption of fresh-start accounting may materially affect our results of operations following the fresh-start reporting date, as we have a new basis in our assets and liabilities. As a result of the adoption of fresh-start reporting and the effects of the implementation of the Plan, our consolidated financial statements subsequent to September 9, 2016 are not comparable to our consolidated financial statements prior to September 9, 2016. References to "Successor" or "Successor Company" relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to September 9, 2016. References to "Predecessor" or "Predecessor Company" related to the financial position and results of operations of the Company prior to, and including, September 9, 2016, as such, "black-line" financial statements are presented to distinguish between the Predecessor and Successor companies. Refer to Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 3, "Fresh-start Accounting," for further details. 
 2018 Capital Budget 
         We expect to spend approximately $280 million to $320 million on drilling and completion capital expenditures during 2018. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $30 million to $40 million on infrastructure, seismic and other in 2018. Our 2018 drilling and completion budget currently contemplates running an average of three operated rigs in the Delaware Basin during the year and is subject to change. After the pending acquisition of the West Quito Draw Properties closes, discussed above in "Recent Developments," our 2018 capital budget will be revised. 
         We expect to fund our budgeted 2018 capital expenditures with cash on hand, cash flows from operations, proceeds from debt and equity issuances and borrowings under our Senior Credit Agreement. We strive to maintain financial flexibility and may access capital markets as necessary to maintain adequate borrowing capacity under our Senior Credit Agreement, facilitate drilling on our large undeveloped acreage position and permit us to selectively expand our acreage position. In the event our cash flows are materially less than anticipated and other sources of capital we historically have utilized are not available on acceptable terms, we may reduce our capital spending. 
         Our financial results depend upon many factors, but are largely driven by the volume of our oil and natural gas production and the price that we receive for that production. Our production volumes will decline as reserves are depleted unless we expend capital in successful development and 
 13

   exploration activities or acquire properties with existing production. The amount we realize for our production depends predominately upon commodity prices and our related commodity price hedging activities, which are affected by changes in market demand and supply, as impacted by overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. Accordingly, finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves in an economical manner is critical to our long-term success. 
   Business Strategy 
         Our primary long-term objective is to increase stockholder value by growing our inventory of economic drilling locations in addition to growing our reserves, production and cash flow. To accomplish this objective, we intend to execute the following business strategies: 


 Develop our Acreage Position to Grow Production, Reserves and Cash Flow
Efficiently.  We are the operator for the majority of our acreage, which gives us control over the timing of capital expenditures, execution and
costs. It also allows us to adjust our capital spending based on drilling results and the economic environment. Our leasing strategy is to pursue long-term contracts that allow us to maintain flexible
development plans and avoid short-term obligations to drill wells, as have been common in other resource plays. As operator, we are also able to evaluate industry drilling results and implement
improved operating practices which may enhance our initial production rates, ultimate recovery factors and rate of return on invested capital. 
 Maintain Strong Balance Sheet and Financial
Flexibility.  We believe our cash on hand, internally generated cash flows, borrowing capacity under our Senior Credit Agreement and access to
capital markets will provide us with sufficient liquidity to execute our current capital program and strategy. We have no near term debt maturities. Our management team is focused on maintaining a
strong balance sheet. We also employ a hedging program to reduce the variability of our cash flows used to support our capital spending. 
 Grow Our Liquids Rich Acreage
Positions.  We plan to continue to selectively acquire high quality assets in our liquids-rich resource play to expand our drilling inventory. We
will leverage our management team's acquisition and divestiture, geologic, engineering and financial expertise to selectively identify and source acquisitions of additional acreage at attractive
prices. 
 Manage Our Property Portfolio
Actively.  We continually evaluate our property base to identify and divest or trade acreage that does not fit our plans to drill long-lateral
operated wells (i.e. primarily 10,000 foot laterals). We may also divest non-core or less economic properties over time which will allow us to focus on a portfolio of core properties with the
greatest economic potential to increase our proved reserves and production. 

 Our Competitive Strengths 
         We have a number of competitive strengths that we believe will allow us to successfully execute our business strategies: 
 

 Proven Management Team.  Our
management team and technical professionals, including geologists and engineers, have decades of combined experience in the industry and a track record for creating stockholder value. 
 Premier Asset Base.  Our proved
reserves, production and acreage are located in concentrated positions in a premier onshore U.S. basin, the Delaware Basin. The Delaware Basin provides exposure to a variety of reservoir formations,
each of which has its own characteristics that impact the costs to drill, complete and operate as well as the composition (and therefore value) 

 14

   

of
the hydrocarbon stream. We believe that this diversity in reservoir zones provides us with broad flexibility to direct our capital resources to projects with the greatest potential returns. 


 Extensive Experience in Resource
Plays.  Our team has significant experience in all aspects of the development of resource plays. We have been successful in consistently improving
drilling times and reserve recoveries through innovation, the use of new technologies and a focus on controlling costs. In addition to our core strength in exploration and production, our personnel
have experience in building midstream infrastructure and managing oilfield service activities. 
 Strong Technical Team.  We
believe that there are certain competitive advantages to be gained by employing a highly skilled technical staff. Our technical team has significant experience and expertise in applying the most
sophisticated technologies used in unconventional resource style plays, including 3-D seismic interpretation, horizontal drilling, deep onshore drilling, comprehensive multi-stage hydraulic fracture
stimulation programs, and other exploration, production, and processing technologies. We believe this technical expertise is partly responsible for our management team's strong track record of
successful exploration and development, including new discoveries and defining core producing areas in emerging plays.

         The reserves information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represents only estimates. Reserve evaluation is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers may vary significantly. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may lead to revising the original estimate. Accordingly, initial reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. The meaningfulness of such estimates depends primarily on the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. Except to the extent we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities or both, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced. For additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves, the preparation of such estimates by Netherland, Sewell and other information about our oil and natural gas reserves, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited)." 
         Proved reserve estimates are based on the unweighted arithmetic average prices on the first day of each month for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2017. Average prices for the 12-month period were as follows: WTI crude oil spot price of $51.34 per Bbl, adjusted by lease or field for quality, transportation fees, and market differentials and a Henry Hub natural gas spot price of $2.976 per MMBtu, as adjusted by lease or field for energy content, transportation fees, and market differentials. All prices and costs associated with operating wells were held constant in accordance with SEC guidelines. 
         The following table presents certain proved reserve information as of December 31, 2017.

Natural gas reserves are converted to oil reserves using a ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl of oil. This ratio does not assume price equivalency and, given price differentials, the price for a barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas may differ significantly from the price for a barrel of oil.


        The following table sets forth the number of productive oil and natural gas wells in which we owned an interest as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Shut-in wells currently not capable of production are excluded from the well information below.

  Oil and Natural Gas Production 
         As discussed elsewhere, during 2017 we divested our assets located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota and in the El Halcón area of East Texas, which represented substantially all of our proved reserves and production at the time, and we acquired certain properties in the Delaware Basin, discussed in greater detail below. As a consequence, our estimated proved reserves, oil and natural gas production and anticipated capital expenditures are currently focused entirely in this core area. 
 Core Resource PlayDelaware Basin 
         We have working interests in approximately 40,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin as of December 31, 2017 in Pecos, Reeves, Ward and Winkler Counties, Texas. This core resource play is characterized by high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content in thick, continuous sections of source rock that can provide repeatable drilling opportunities and significant initial production rates. Our primary targets in this area are the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring formations. As noted above under "2018 Capital Budget," our current capital budget contemplates running an average of three operated rigs in the Delaware Basin during 2018. After the pending acquisition of the West Quito Draw Properties closes, our 2018 capital budget will be revised. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 31 operated wells producing in this area in addition to minor working interests in three non-operated wells. Our average daily net production from this area for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 3,700 Boe/d. As of December 31, 2017, estimated proved reserves for the Delaware Basin were approximately 51.1 MMBoe, of which approximately 31% were classified as proved developed and approximately 69% as proved undeveloped. 
 Risk Management 
         We have designed a risk management policy for the use of derivative instruments to provide partial protection against certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations, such as commodity price declines. Derivative contracts are utilized to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations and reduce the variability in our cash flows associated with anticipated sales on future oil and natural gas production. Our objective generally is to hedge 70-80% of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next 18 to 24 months. However, our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. Our hedge policies and objectives change as our operational profile changes and/or commodity prices. Our future performance is subject to commodity price risks and our future cash flows from operations may be subject to greater volatility than historically. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative trading purposes. 
         While there are many different types of derivatives available, we typically use costless collar agreements and swap agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively. The costless collar agreements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period. All costless collar agreements provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price is below the floor. The swap agreements call for payments to, or receipts from, counterparties depending on whether the index price of oil or natural gas for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the period contracted under the swap agreement. 
         It is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers. We did not post collateral under any of our derivative contracts as they are secured under our Senior Credit Agreement or are uncollateralized trades. We will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and 
 17

   Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 9, "Derivative and Hedging Activities," for additional information. 
   Oil and Natural Gas Operations 
         Our principal properties consist of leasehold interests in developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas properties and the reserves associated with these properties. Generally, oil and natural gas leases remain in force as long as production in paying quantities is maintained. Leases on undeveloped oil and natural gas properties are typically for a primary term of three to five years within which we are generally required to develop the property or the lease will expire. In some cases, the primary term of leases on our undeveloped properties can be extended by option payments; the amount of any payments and time extended vary by lease. 
         The table below sets forth the results of our drilling activities for the periods indicated:

Although a well may be classified as productive upon completion, future changes in oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and production may result in the well becoming uneconomical, particularly extension or exploratory wells where there is no production history.


        We own interests in developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas acreage in the locations set forth in the table below. These ownership interests generally take the form of working interests in oil 
 18

   and natural gas leases that have varying provisions. The following table presents a summary of our acreage interests as of December 31, 2017:

        The table below reflects the percentage of our total net undeveloped acreage as of December 31, 2017 that will expire each year if we do not establish production in paying quantities on the units in which such acreage is included or do not pay (to the extent we have the contractual right to pay) delay rentals or obtain other extensions to maintain the lease.

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​


        For our proved undeveloped locations that are not scheduled to be drilled until after lease expiration, we continually review our near-term lease expirations, actively pursue lease extensions and renewals and modify our drilling schedules in order to preserve the leases. Of the acreage with 2018 expiration dates, approximately 8,600 net acres relates to acreage in the Delaware Basin, our core area of operations. We intend to preserve this acreage through our 2018 drilling plan supplemented with lease extensions or renewals, where necessary. We have no current plans to drill on acreage in other areas that we held as of December 31, 2017, outside of our core area of operations. 
         At December 31, 2017, we had estimated proved reserves of approximately 51.1 MMBoe comprised of 34.1 MMBbls of crude oil, 9.2 MMBbls of natural gas liquids, and 46.7 Bcf of natural gas. The following table sets forth, at December 31, 2017, these reserves: 

   
 | Proved Developed | | Proved Undeveloped | Total Proved
Oil (MBbls) | | 10,150 | | 23,983 | 34,133
Natural Gas Liquids (MBbls) | | 3,151 | | 6,045 | 9,196 
Natural Gas (MMcf) | | 16,303 | | 30,435 | 46,738
Equivalent (MBoe)(1) | | 16,018 | | 35,101 | 51,119


  (1)
Natural gas reserves are converted to oil reserves using a ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl of oil. This ratio does not assume price equivalency and, given price differentials, the price for a barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas may differ significantly from the price for a barrel of oil.


        At December 31, 2017, total proved reserves were approximately 51.1 MMBoe, a 97.5 MMBoe net decrease over the previous year's estimate of 148.6 MMBoe. The net decrease in total proved reserves 
 19

   was the result of divestitures totaling 160.3 MMBoe and production of 10.0 MMBoe, partially offset by acquisitions totaling 26.8 MMBoe, additions and extensions of 25.7 MMBoe and net positive revisions of 20.4 MMBoe. In 2017, we divested of all of our assets in the Bakken/Three Forks formations in North Dakota, and the Eagle Ford formation in East Texas, and other non-core assets, which in its entirety comprised all of our proved reserves at December 31, 2016. Substantially all of our proved reserves at December 31, 2017 are associated with our Delaware Basin properties. 
         At December 31, 2017, our estimated proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves were approximately 35.1 MMBoe, a 27.6 MMBoe net decrease over the previous year's estimate of 62.7 MMBoe. The net decrease in total proved undeveloped reserves was the result of divestitures of 59.8 MMBoe and development of 7.4 MMBoe, partially offset by acquisitions of 17.6 MMBoe, additions and extensions of 17.4 MMBoe and net positive revisions of 4.6 MMBoe. 
         As of December 31, 2017, all of our PUD reserves are planned to be developed within five years from the date they were initially recorded. During 2017, approximately $143.3 million in capital expenditures went toward the development of proved undeveloped reserves, which includes drilling, completion and other facility costs associated with developing proved undeveloped wells. 
         Reliable technologies were used to determine areas where PUD locations are more than one offset location away from a producing well. These technologies include seismic data, wire line openhole log data, core data, log cross-sections, performance data, and statistical analysis. In such areas, these data demonstrated consistent, continuous reservoir characteristics in addition to significant quantities of economic estimated ultimate recoveries from individual producing wells. Our management team has been a leader in data gathering and evaluation in these areas and was instrumental in developing consortiums that allow various operators to exchange data. We relied only on production flow tests and historical production data, along with the reliable geologic data mentioned above to estimate proved reserves. No other alternative methods or technologies were used to estimate proved reserves. Out of total proved undeveloped reserves of 35.1 MMBoe at December 31, 2017, 7.9 MMBoe were associated with 9 gross PUD locations that were more than one offset location from a producing well. 
         The estimates of quantities of proved reserves contained in this report were made in accordance with the definitions contained in SEC Release No. 33-8995,  Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting. For additional information on our oil and natural gas reserves, including a table detailing the changes by year of our proved reserves, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited)."
         We account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting in accordance with SEC regulations. Accordingly, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration, and development of proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs, direct internal costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized. All general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred. Sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change. Depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on proved reserves. The net capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties are subject to a quarterly full cost ceiling test. See further discussion in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 6,  "Oil and Natural Gas Properties."

           Capitalized costs of our evaluated and unevaluated properties at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows (in thousands):

        The average crude oil and natural gas sales prices above do not reflect the impact of cash paid on, or cash received from, settled derivative contracts as these amounts are reflected as "Net gain (loss) on derivative contracts" in the consolidated statements of operations, consistent with our decision not to elect hedge accounting. Including this impact, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the average crude oil sales price was $47.62 per Bbl and the average natural gas sales price was $2.29 per Mcf. Including this impact, during the period of September 10, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and the period of January 1, 2016 through September 9, 2016, average crude oil sales prices were $68.99 and $69.25 per Bbl and average natural gas sales prices were $2.33 and $1.58 per Mcf, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, including the impact of our settled derivative contracts, the average crude oil sales price was $78.50 per Bbl and the average natural gas sales price was $3.06 per Mcf. 
   Competitive Conditions in the Business 
         The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive and we compete with a substantial number of other companies that have greater financial and other resources. Many of these companies explore for, produce and market oil and natural gas, as well as carry on refining operations and market the resultant products on a worldwide basis. The primary areas in which we encounter substantial competition are in locating and acquiring desirable leasehold acreage for our drilling and development operations, locating and acquiring attractive producing oil and natural gas properties, obtaining sufficient availability of drilling and completion equipment and services, obtaining purchasers and transporters of the oil and natural gas we produce and hiring and retaining key employees. There is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other industries producing energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the government of the United States and the states in which our properties are located. It is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. 
   Other Business Matters 
   Markets and Major Customers 
         The purchasers of our oil and natural gas production consist primarily of independent marketers, major oil and natural gas companies and gas pipeline companies. Historically, we have not experienced any significant losses from uncollectible accounts. In 2017 and 2016, two individual purchasers of our production, Crestwood Midstream Partners, formerly Arrow Field Services LLC (Crestwood), and Suncor Energy Marketing Inc. (Suncor), each accounted for more than 10% of our total sales, collectively representing 58% of our total sales for each year. In 2015, three individual purchasers, Crestwood, Sunoco Inc. and Suncor, each accounted for more than 10% of our total sales, collectively representing 57% of our total sales for the year. 
 Seasonality of Business 
         Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, natural gas and can also delay drilling activities, disrupting our overall business plans. Demand for natural gas is typically higher during the winter, resulting in higher natural gas prices for our natural gas production during our first and fourth fiscal quarters. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, our results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that we may realize on an annual basis. 
 23

     Operational Risks 
         Oil and natural gas exploration and development involves a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. There is no assurance that we will discover or acquire additional oil and natural gas in commercial quantities. Oil and natural gas operations also involve the risk that well fires, blowouts, equipment failure, human error and other events may cause accidental releases of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids or drilling fluids into the environment, or cause significant injury to persons or property. In such event, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the satisfaction of which could substantially reduce available cash and possibly result in loss of oil and natural gas properties. Such hazards may also cause damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and pipeline or other processing facilities. 
         As is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position or cash flows. For further discussion on risks see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Regulations 
         All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units, the density of wells that may be drilled in oil and natural gas properties and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of land and leases to facilitate exploration while other states rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of land and leases. In areas where pooling is primarily or exclusively voluntary, it may be difficult to form spacing units and therefore difficult to develop a project if the operator owns less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose specified requirements regarding the ratability of production. On some occasions, local authorities have imposed moratoria or other restrictions on exploration and production activities pending investigations and studies addressing potential local impacts of these activities before allowing oil and natural gas exploration and production to proceed. 
         The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. 
   Environmental Regulations 
         Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection 
 24

   Agency, commonly referred to as the EPA, issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures. Among other things, environmental regulatory programs typically govern the permitting, construction and operation of a facility. Many factors, including public perception, can materially impact the ability to secure an environmental construction or operation permit. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which could result in liability for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on our part. 
         Beyond existing requirements, new programs and changes in existing programs may address various aspects of our business, including natural occurring radioactive materials, oil and natural gas exploration and production, air emissions, waste management, and underground injection of waste material. Environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. 
   Hazardous Substances and Wastes 
         The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons may include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances that have been released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of some health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. 
         Under the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, referred to as RCRA, most wastes generated by the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are not regulated as hazardous waste. Periodically, however, there are proposals to lift the existing exemption for oil and gas wastes and reclassify them as hazardous wastes or to subject them to enhanced solid waste regulation. If such proposals were to be enacted, they could have a significant impact on our operating costs and on those of all the industry in general. In the ordinary course of our operations, moreover some wastes generated in connection with our exploration and production activities may be regulated as solid waste under RCRA, as hazardous waste under existing RCRA regulations or as hazardous substances under CERCLA. From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own or at which we have operations. These properties and the materials or wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we have been and may be required to remove or remediate such materials or wastes. 
   Water Discharges 
         Our operations also may be subject to the federal Clean Water Act and analogous state statutes. Those laws regulate discharges of wastewater, oil, and other pollutants to surface water bodies, such as 
 25

   lakes, rivers, wetlands, and streams. Failure to obtain permits for such discharges could result in civil and criminal penalties, orders to cease such discharges, and costs to remediate and pay natural resources damages. These laws also require the preparation and implementation of Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plans in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. In the event of a discharge of oil into U.S. waters we could be liable under the Oil Pollution Act for clean up costs, damages and economic losses. 
         Our oil and natural gas production also generates salt water, which we dispose of by underground injection. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), the Underground Injection Control (UIC) regulations promulgated under the SDWA and related state programs regulate the drilling and operation of salt water disposal wells. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states, and in others it is delegated to the state for administering. Permits must be obtained before drilling salt water disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring must be conducted periodically to ensure the casing is not leaking salt water to groundwater. Contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SDWA and state laws. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury. 
   Hydraulic Fracturing 
         Our completion operations are subject to regulation, which may increase in the short- or long-term. In particular, the well completion technique known as hydraulic fracturing, which is used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas, has come under increased scrutiny by the environmental community, and many local, state and federal regulators. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure, usually down casing that is cemented in the wellbore, into prospective rock formations at depths to stimulate oil and natural gas production. We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with substantially all of the wells for which we are the operator. 
         Working at the direction of Congress, the EPA issued a study in 2016 finding that hydraulic fracturing could potentially harm drinking water resources under adverse circumstances such as injection directly into groundwater or into production wells lacking mechanical integrity. The EPA also promulgated pre-treatment standards under the Clean Water Act for wastewater discharges from shale hydraulic fracturing operations to municipal sewage treatment plants. Beyond that, several environmental groups have petitioned the EPA to extend toxic release reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act to the oil and natural gas extraction industry and to require disclosure under the Toxic Substances Control Act of chemicals used in fracturing. Congress might likewise consider legislation to amend the federal SDWA to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. Certain states, including Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, already have issued similar disclosure rules. 
         In addition, the Department of the Interior promulgated regulations concerning the use of hydraulic fracturing on lands under its jurisdiction, which includes lands on which we conduct or plan to conduct operations while the Trump Administration rescinded those rules that decision is being challenged in court. Regardless of how the federal issues are eventually resolved, states have been imposing new restrictions or bans on hydraulic fracturing. Even local jurisdictions, such as Denton, Texas and several cities in Colorado, have adopted, or tried to adopt, regulations restricting hydraulic fracturing. Additional hydraulic fracturing requirements at the federal, state or local level may limit our ability to operate or increase our operating costs. 
 26

     Air Emissions 
         The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed and may continue to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources, including oil and natural gas production. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Our operations, or the operations of service companies engaged by us, may in certain circumstances and locations be subject to permits and restrictions under these statutes for emissions of air pollutants. 
         In 2012 and 2016, the EPA issued air regulations for the oil and natural gas industry that address emissions from certain new sources of volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, air toxics, and methane. The rules included the first federal air standards for natural gas and oil wells that are hydraulically fractured, or refractured, as well as requirements for other processes and equipment, including storage tanks. Compliance with these regulations has imposed additional requirements and costs on our operations. The Trump Administration may rescind some or all of the 2016 requirements, but supporters of the existing regulations likely would seek judicial review of any such decision. 
         In October 2015, the EPA announced that it was lowering the primary national ambient air quality standard for ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. Implementation will take place over several years; however, the new standard could result in a significant expansion of ozone nonattainment areas across the United States, including areas in which we operate. Oil and natural gas operations in ozone nonattainment areas would likely be subject to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements, and increased permitting delays and costs. 
   Climate Change 
         Studies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth's atmosphere. In response, governments increasingly have been adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that require reporting and reductions of the emission of such greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, are considered greenhouse gases. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement address greenhouse gas emissions, and several countries, including those comprising the European Union, have established greenhouse gas regulatory systems. In the United States, at the state level, many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have been implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through emission inventories, emissions targets, greenhouse gas cap and trade programs or incentives for renewable energy generation, while others have considered adopting such greenhouse gas programs. 
         At the federal level, the EPA has issued regulations requiring us and other companies to annually report certain greenhouse gas emissions from our oil and natural gas facilities. Beyond its measuring and reporting rules, the EPA has issued an "Endangerment Finding" under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The finding served as the first step in issuing regulations that require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities. 
         In addition, the Obama Administration developed a Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions that was intended to result by 2025 in a 40-45% decrease in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry as compared to 2012 levels. Consistent with that strategy, the EPA issued air rules for oil and gas production sources, and the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) promulgated standards for reducing venting and flaring on public lands. The Trump Administration has been trying to roll back 
 27

   many of the Obama-era policies and rules; however, the long-term direction of federal climate regulation is uncertain. 
         Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur additional operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems or other compliance costs, and reduce demand for our products. 
   The National Environmental Policy Act 
         Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. All of our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. 
   Threatened and endangered species, migratory birds, and natural resources 
         Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Clean Water Act. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions on federal land use or on private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Where takings of or harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat, or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to prevent or restrict oil and gas exploration activities or seek damages for any injury, whether resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and in some cases, criminal penalties, may result. 
   Occupational Safety and Health Act 
         We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees. 
 Employees and Principal Office 
         As of December 31, 2017, we had 119 full-time employees. We hire independent contractors on an as needed basis. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees. We believe that our employee relationships are satisfactory. 
         As of December 31, 2017, we leased corporate office space in Houston, Texas at 1000 Louisiana Street, where our principal offices are located. We also lease corporate office space in Denver, Colorado.

      ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS 
  Oil and natural gas prices are volatile, and low prices could have a material adverse impact on our business. 
         Our revenues, profitability and future growth and the carrying value of our properties depend substantially on prevailing oil and natural gas prices. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. The amount we will be able to borrow under our Senior Credit Agreement will be subject to periodic redeterminations based in part on current oil and natural gas prices and on changing expectations of future prices. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce and have an adverse effect on the value of our properties. 
         Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Among the factors that can cause volatility are:
 

 the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas; 
 the ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producing countries to agree upon and maintain oil prices
and production levels; 
 social unrest and political instability, particularly in major oil and natural gas producing regions outside the United States, such as the
Middle East, and armed conflict or terrorist attacks, whether or not in oil or natural gas producing regions; 
 the level of consumer product demand; 
 the growth of consumer product demand in emerging markets, such as China; 
 labor unrest in oil and natural gas producing regions; 
 weather conditions, including hurricanes and other natural occurrences that affect the supply and/or demand of oil and natural gas; 
 the price and availability of alternative fuels; 

 29

   

 the price of foreign imports; 
 worldwide economic conditions; and 
 the availability of liquid natural gas imports. 

         These external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to estimate future prices of oil and natural gas. 
   We are substantially dependent upon our drilling success on our Delaware Basin properties, which are largely undeveloped and with which we have less experience. 
         We divested substantially all of our proved reserves and production when we sold our Williston Basin and El Halcón assets in 2017. The disposition of these assets, combined with our other recent acquisition and divestiture activities, transformed our Company from multiple basin operations in which we had years of accumulated operational experience and substantial proved developed acreage to a pure-play, single-basin operator, with largely unproven acreage concentrated in the Delaware Basin in West Texas, an area in which we have only limited recent experience. As a consequence, we are subject to the greater risks associated with a more concentrated, less developed property portfolio in an area where we have less experience, and are more dependent upon our future drilling success in that area. If our drilling results are less than anticipated, or the risks associated with a more concentrated property portfolio, such as regional supply and demand factors and delays or interruptions in production from governmental regulation, transportation constraints, market limitations, water shortages or other conditions, adversely impact our ability to produce or market our production, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
   Future sales of our common stock in the public market or the issuance of securities senior to our common stock, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in stock offerings. 
         A large percentage of our shares of common stock are held by a relatively small number of investors. Further, we entered into registration rights agreements with certain of those investors pursuant to which we filed a registration statement with the SEC to facilitate potential future sales of such shares by them. Sales by us or our stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or even the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or could impair our ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using, our equity securities. 
         We are currently authorized to issue 1.0 billion shares of common stock and 1.0 million shares of preferred stock, with such designations, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions as determined by the board of directors. As of February 23, 2018, we had outstanding approximately 158.6 million shares of common stock and warrants and options to purchase an aggregate of 11.4 million shares of our common stock. 
         As of February 23, 2018, we have also reserved an additional 7.9 million shares for future issuance to our directors, officers and employees as restricted stock or stock option awards pursuant to our 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The potential issuance of such additional shares of common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. 
         We may issue common stock or other equity securities senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance acquisitions, to adjust our leverage ratio, and to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of warrants and options, or for other reasons. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales or issuances of shares of our common stock or other equity securities, or the availability of shares of common stock or such other equity securities for future sale or issuance, will have on the trading price of our common stock. 
 30

     There may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. 
         Funds advised by Franklin Advisors, Inc. and Ares Management LLC hold a significant portion of our common stock. Circumstances may arise in which these stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common stock. In addition, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholders. 
   We may have difficulty financing our planned capital expenditures which could adversely affect our growth. 
         Our business requires substantial capital expenditures primarily to fund our drilling program. We may also continue to selectively increase our acreage position, which would require capital in addition to the capital necessary to drill on our existing acreage. In addition, it is possible that we will acquire acreage in other areas that we believe are prospective for oil and natural gas production and expend capital to develop such acreage. We expect to use borrowings under our Senior Credit Agreement and proceeds from potential future capital markets transactions, if necessary, to fund capital expenditures that are in excess of our operating cash flow and cash on hand. 
         Our Senior Credit Agreement limits our borrowings to the lesser of the borrowing base and the total commitments. As of December 31, 2017, our Senior Credit Agreement had a borrowing base of approximately $100.0 million. As of December 31, 2017, we had no indebtedness outstanding, approximately $1.6 million of letters of credit outstanding and approximately $98.4 million of borrowing capacity available under our Senior Credit Agreement. Our borrowing base is determined semi-annually, and may also be redetermined periodically at the discretion of our lenders. A reduction in our borrowing base could require us to repay any indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base. Our Senior Credit Agreement also contains certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of (i) a Total Net Indebtedness Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) not to exceed 4.00:1.00 and (ii) a Current Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) not to be less than 1.00:1.00. 
         On February 2, 2018, we entered into the Second Amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement which among other things, for certain fiscal quarters in 2018, provided flexibility with respect to certain financial covenants as specified in the Senior Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment provides for (i) the use of annualized financial data in determining EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2018, September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018, (ii) an increase in the ratio of our Consolidated Total Net Debt (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) to EBITDA of 4.50:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2018, and a ratio of 4.00:1.00 for any fiscal quarter thereafter, (iii) a waiver of compliance with the covenant relating to the Total Net Indebtedness Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2018, and (iv) a waiver of the automatic reduction to the borrowing base that would otherwise have resulted from our issuance of the Additional 2025 Notes. In the event we have difficulty meeting the total net indebtedness leverage ratio test or the current ratio test in the future, we would be required to seek additional relief, and there is no assurance that it would be granted. 
         Additionally, the indenture governing our senior debt contain covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including borrowings under our Senior Credit Agreement, unless we meet one of two alternative tests or utilize the limited exceptions available. The first test applies to all indebtedness and requires that, after giving effect to the incurrence of additional debt, our fixed charge coverage ratio (which is the ratio of our adjusted consolidated EBITDA (as defined in our indenture) 
 31

   to our adjusted consolidated interest expense over the trailing four fiscal quarters) will be at least 2.00:1.00. The second test allows us to incur additional indebtedness, beyond the limitations of the fixed charge coverage ratio test, as long as this additional debt is incurred under Credit Facilities (as defined in our indenture) and generally, the amount thereof is not more than, subject to certain exceptions, the greater of (i) $350 million, (ii) the borrowing base in effect under our Senior Credit Agreement, and (iii) 30% of our adjusted consolidated net tangible assets, or ACNTA. ACNTA is defined in our indenture and is determined primarily by the value of discounted future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves plus the capitalized cost attributable to our unevaluated properties. Currently, we are permitted to incur additional indebtedness under the indenture, but may be limited in the future. Lower oil and natural gas prices in the future could reduce our adjusted consolidated EBITDA, as well as our ACNTA, and thus could reduce our ability to incur additional indebtedness. 
         Additionally, our ability to complete future equity offerings is limited by general market conditions. If we are not able to borrow sufficient amounts under our Senior Credit Agreement and/or are unable to raise sufficient capital to fund our capital expenditures, we may be required to curtail our drilling, development, land acquisition and other activities, which could result in a decrease in our production of oil and natural gas, forfeiture of leasehold interests if we are unable or unwilling to renew them, and could force us to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our results and future operations. 
   We may be required to take non-cash asset write downs. 
         We may be required under full cost accounting rules to write down the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties if oil and natural gas prices decline or if there are substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our exploration results. We utilize the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas exploration and development activities. Under full cost accounting, we are required by SEC regulations to perform a ceiling test each quarter. The ceiling test is an impairment test and generally establishes a maximum, or "ceiling," of the book value of oil and natural gas properties that is equal to the expected after tax present value (discounted at 10%) of the future net cash flows from proved reserves, including the effect of cash flow hedges when hedge accounting is applied, calculated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of each month for the 12-month period ending at the balance sheet date. If the net book value of oil and natural gas properties (reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability and asset retirement obligation) exceeds the ceiling limitation, SEC regulations require us to impair or "write down" the book value of our oil and natural gas properties. 
         We experienced write downs in the recent past. For instance, during 2016, the net book value of our oil and natural gas properties at March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2016 exceeded the respective ceiling amounts for each quarter end. As a result, we recorded full cost ceiling test impairments before income taxes of $420.9 million for the period of September 10, 2016 through September 30, 2016 and $754.8 million for the period January 1, 2016 through September 9, 2016. The impairment at September 30, 2016 primarily reflects the pricing differences between the first-day-of-the-month average price for the preceding twelve months required by Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10 and ASC 932 used in calculating the ceiling test and the forward-looking prices required by ASC 852 to estimate the fair value of the Company's oil and natural gas properties on the fresh-start reporting date, September 9, 2016. The ceiling test impairments at March 31 and June 30, 2016 were driven by decreases in the first-day-of-the-month average prices for crude oil used in the ceiling test calculations since December 31, 2015. As ceiling test computations depend in part upon the unweighted arithmetic average prices of oil and natural gas prices, which are inherently volatile, sustained lower commodity prices will have a material impact upon our full cost ceiling test calculation. Continued write downs of oil and natural gas properties could continue to occur until such time as commodity prices have recovered, and remained at recovered levels, so as to increase the 12-month average price 
 32

   used in the ceiling calculation. Depending on the magnitude, a ceiling test write down could materially affect our results of operations. 
         Costs associated with unevaluated properties, which were approximately $765.8 million at December 31, 2017, are not initially subject to the ceiling test limitation. Rather, we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value based upon our intentions with respect to drilling on such properties, the remaining lease term, geological and geophysical evaluations, drilling results, the assignment of proved reserves, and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. These factors are significantly influenced by our expectations regarding future commodity prices, development costs, and access to capital at acceptable cost. During any period in which these factors indicate impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to depletion and the ceiling test limitation. Accordingly, a significant change in these factors, many of which are beyond our control, may shift a significant amount of cost from unevaluated properties into the full cost pool that is subject to depletion and the ceiling test limitation. 
   Our exploration and development drilling efforts and the operation of our wells may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns. 
         We require significant amounts of undeveloped leasehold acreage to further our development efforts. Exploration, development, drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be discovered. We invest in property, including undeveloped leasehold acreage, which we believe will result in projects that will add value over time. However, we cannot guarantee that our leasehold acreage will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such leasehold acreage or wells. Drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting operating and other costs. In addition, wells that are profitable may not achieve our targeted rate of return. Our ability to achieve our target results are dependent upon the current and future market prices for oil and natural gas, costs associated with producing oil and natural gas and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost. 
         In addition, we may not be successful in controlling our drilling and production costs to improve our overall return. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. We cannot predict the cost of drilling and completing a well, and we may be forced to limit, delay or cancel drilling operations as a result of a variety of factors, including:
 

 unexpected drilling conditions; 
 pressure or irregularities in formations; 
 equipment failures or accidents and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling and completion equipment and services; 
 adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes; and 
 compliance with governmental requirements. 

   We will be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions, and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult and may involve unexpected costs or delays. 
         We have completed in the past and may complete in the future significant acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our 
 33

   overall business strategy, which may include the acquisition of asset packages of producing properties, undeveloped acreage or existing companies or businesses operating in our industry. The successful acquisition of assets in our industry requires an assessment of several factors, including:
 

 recoverable reserves; 
 future oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and their appropriate differentials; 
 development and operating costs; and 
 potential environmental and other liabilities. 

         The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well or well site, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We are generally not able to obtain contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and normally acquire properties on an "as is" basis. 
         Significant acquisitions of existing companies or businesses and other strategic transactions may involve additional risks, including:
 

 diversion of our management's attention to evaluating, negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions; 
 the challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations, information management and other technology systems and business cultures with our
own while carrying on our ongoing business; 
 difficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations; 
 the challenge of integrating environmental compliance systems to meet requirements of rapidly changing regulations; 
 the challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with acquired operations; and 
 failure to realize the full benefit that we expect in estimated proved reserves, production volume, cost savings from operating synergies or
other benefits anticipated from an acquisition, or to realize these benefits within our expected time frame. 

         The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business. If our senior management is not able to manage the integration process effectively, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could be materially and adversely affected. 
   Historically, we have had substantial indebtedness and we may incur substantially more debt in the future. Higher levels of indebtedness make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. 
         We have incurred debt amounting to approximately $425.0 million principal amount as of December 31, 2017. In addition, on February 15, 2018, we issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% senior notes due 2025 in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S, and applicable state securities laws. As a result of our indebtedness, we will need to use a portion of our cash flow to pay 
 34

   interest, which will reduce the amount we will have available to finance our operations and other business activities and could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. Our indebtedness under our Senior Credit Agreement is at a variable interest rate, and so a rise in interest rates will generate greater interest expense to the extent we do not have hedging arrangements that are effective in mitigating interest rate fluctuations. The amount of our debt may also cause us to be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. 
         We may incur substantially more debt in the future. The indenture governing our outstanding senior notes contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness. These restrictions, however, are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, we could incur substantial additional indebtedness in compliance with these restrictions. Moreover, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute "indebtedness" as defined under the indenture. At December 31, 2017, our Senior Credit Agreement had a borrowing base of approximately $100.0 million. At December 31, 2017, we had no indebtedness outstanding, approximately $1.6 million of letters of credit outstanding and approximately $98.4 million of borrowing capacity available under our Senior Credit Agreement. 
         Our ability to meet our debt obligations and other expenses will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors, many of which we are unable to control. If our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt, we may be required to refinance debt, sell assets or sell additional shares of common or preferred stock on terms that we may not find attractive if it may be done at all. Further, our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to our indebtedness could result in a default under that indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital. 
         As of the date of this filing, our corporate credit rating was "B" with a stable outlook by Standard and Poor's (S&P) and "B3" with a stable outlook by Moody's Investors Service (Moody's). Although we are not aware of any current plans of these or other rating agencies to lower their respective ratings on us or our senior debt, we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded. A downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital and our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy. If our credit rating were downgraded, it could be difficult for us to raise debt in the public debt markets and the cost of that new debt could be higher than debt we could raise with our current ratings. In addition, a downgrade could impact requirements for us to provide financial assurance of performance under contractual arrangements or derivative agreements. 
   Unless we replace our reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
         Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Decline rates are typically greatest early in the productive life of a well. Estimates of the decline rate of an oil or natural gas well are inherently imprecise, and are less precise with respect to new or emerging oil and natural gas formations with limited production histories than for more developed formations with established production histories. Our production levels and the reserves that we currently expect to recover from our wells will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change under other circumstances. Thus, our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flow and results of operations are highly dependent upon our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current properties and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional 
 35

   reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, our cash flows and the value of our reserves may decrease, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and potentially the borrowing capacity under our Senior Credit Agreement. 
   Estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves involve assumptions and any material inaccuracies in these assumptions will materially affect the quantities and the value of our reserves. 
         This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves. These estimates are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. This process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise. 
         Actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from those estimated. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and the value of our reserves. Our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 
         At December 31, 2017, approximately 69% of our estimated proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves. The estimates of these oil and natural gas reserves and the costs associated with development of these reserves have been prepared in accordance with SEC regulations, however, actual capital expenditures will likely vary from estimated capital expenditures, development may not occur as scheduled and actual results may not be as estimated. 
   We may not be able to drill wells on a substantial portion of our acreage. 
         We may not be able to drill on a substantial portion of our acreage for various reasons. We may not generate or be able to raise sufficient capital to do so. Commodities pricing may also make drilling some acreage uneconomic. Our actual drilling activities and future drilling budget will depend on drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, lease expirations, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors. In addition, any drilling activities we are able to conduct may not be successful or add additional proved reserves to our overall proved reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   Certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage. 
         As of December 31, 2017, we owned leasehold interests in approximately 40,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin in West Texas of which approximately 19,000 net acres are undeveloped. Unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing these leases during their terms or unless we pay (to the extent we have the contractual right to pay) delay rentals or obtain other extensions to maintain the lease, these leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. We have no current plans to drill on acreage in other areas that we held as of December 31, 2017, outside of our core area of operations. 
 36



        Our drilling plans are subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals. Further, some of our acreage is located in sections where we do not hold the majority of the acreage and therefore it is likely that we will not be named operator of these sections. As a non-operating leaseholder we have less control over the timing of drilling and are therefore subject to additional risk of expirations. 
   We depend substantially on the continued presence of key personnel for critical management decisions and industry contacts. 
         Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees, particularly with respect to providing the critical management decisions and contacts necessary to manage and maintain growth within a highly competitive industry. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense, particularly in the oil and natural gas industry, and there are a limited number of people with the requisite knowledge and experience. Under these conditions, we could be unable to attract and retain these personnel. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. 
   Our oil and natural gas activities are subject to various risks which are beyond our control. 
         Our operations are subject to many risks and hazards incident to exploring and drilling for, producing, transporting, marketing and selling oil and natural gas. Although we may take precautionary measures, many of these risks and hazards are beyond our control and unavoidable under the circumstances. Many of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses, the ability of certain of our wells to produce oil and natural gas in commercial quantities, the rate of production and the economics of the development of, and our investment in the prospects in which we have or will acquire an interest. Any of these risks and hazards could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such risks and hazards include:
 

 human error, accidents, labor force and other factors beyond our control that may cause personal injuries or death to persons and destruction
or damage to equipment and facilities; 
 blowouts, fires, hurricanes, pollution and equipment failures that may result in damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations,
production facilities and equipment; 
 unavailability of materials and equipment; 
 engineering and construction delays; 
 unanticipated transportation costs and delays; 
 unfavorable weather conditions; 
 hazards resulting from unusual or unexpected geological or environmental conditions; 
 environmental regulations and requirements; 
 accidental leakage of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids, drilling fluids or salt water, into the environment; 
 hazards resulting from the presence of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) or other contaminants in gas we produce; 
 changes in laws and regulations, including laws and regulations applicable to oil and natural gas activities or markets for the oil and natural
gas produced; 

 37

   

 fluctuations in supply and demand for oil and natural gas causing variations of the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production;
and 
 the availability of alternative fuels and the price at which they become available. 

         As a result of these risks, expenditures, quantities and rates of production, revenues and operating costs may be materially affected and may differ materially from those anticipated by us. 
   Our ability to sell our production and/or receive market prices for our production may be adversely affected by transportation capacity constraints and interruptions. 
         If the amount of natural gas, condensate or oil being produced by us and others exceeds the capacity of the various transportation pipelines and gathering systems available in our operating areas, it will be necessary for new transportation pipelines and gathering systems to be built. Or, in the case of oil and condensate, it will be necessary for us to rely more heavily on trucks to transport our production, which is more expensive and less efficient than transportation via pipeline. The construction of new pipelines and gathering systems is capital intensive and construction may be postponed, interrupted or cancelled in response to changing economic conditions and the availability and cost of capital. In addition, capital constraints could limit our ability to build gathering systems to transport our production to transportation pipelines. In such event, costs to transport our production may increase materially or we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and/or sell our production at much lower prices than market or than we currently project, which would adversely affect our results of operations. 
         A portion of our production may also be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous other reasons, including as a result of weather conditions (which may worsen due to climate changes), accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could adversely affect our cash flow. 
   The unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and crews, other equipment, supplies, water, personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget. 
         Our industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, water or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies are substantially greater. In addition, the demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases. Increasing levels of exploration and production may increase the demand for oilfield services and equipment, and the costs of these services and equipment may increase, while the quality of these services and equipment may suffer. The unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment, supplies or qualified personnel can materially and adversely affect our operations and profitability. In order to secure drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, we may enter into certain contracts that extend over several months or years. If demand for drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment subside during the period covered by these contracts, the price we are required to pay may be significantly more than the market rate for similar services. 
 38

     We are subject to various contractual limitations that affect the discretion of our management in operating our business. 
         The indenture governing our debt and our Senior Credit Agreement contain various provisions that may limit our management's discretion in certain respects. In particular, these agreements limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things:
 

 pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase shares of our common stock and, under certain circumstances, our convertible preferred stock, and redeem
or repurchase our subordinated debt; 
 make loans to others; 
 make investments; 
 incur additional indebtedness; 
 create certain liens; 
 sell assets; 
 enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us; 
 consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and those of our restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole; 
 engage in transactions with affiliates; 
 enter into hedging contracts; 
 create unrestricted subsidiaries; and 
 enter into sale and leaseback transactions. 

         Compliance with these and other limitations may limit our ability to operate and finance our business and engage in certain transactions in the manner we might otherwise. In addition, if we fail to comply with the limitations under our indenture or Senior Credit Agreement, our creditors, if the agreements so provide, may accelerate the related indebtedness as well as any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to make further funds available to us. 
   Our business is highly competitive. 
         The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive in many respects, including identification of attractive oil and natural gas properties for acquisition, drilling and development, securing financing for such activities and obtaining the necessary equipment and personnel to conduct such operations and activities. In seeking suitable opportunities, we compete with a number of other companies, including large oil and natural gas companies and other independent operators with greater financial resources, larger numbers of personnel and facilities, and, in some cases, with more expertise. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with these entities. 
   We are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that frequently are amended to impose more stringent requirements that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. 
         Companies that explore for and develop, produce, sell and transport oil and natural gas in the United States are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including complex tax and environmental, health and safety laws and the corresponding regulations, and are required to obtain various permits and approvals from federal, state and local agencies. If these permits are not 
 39

   issued or unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling activities, we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include:
 

 water discharge and disposal permits for drilling operations; 
 drilling bonds; 
 drilling permits; 
 reports concerning operations; 
 air quality, air emissions, noise levels and related permits; 
 spacing of wells; 
 rights-of-way and easements; 
 unitization and pooling of properties; 
 pipeline construction; 
 gathering, transportation and marketing of oil and natural gas; 
 taxation; and 
 waste transport and disposal permits and requirements. 

         Failure to comply with applicable laws may result in the suspension or termination of operations and subject us to liabilities, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Compliance costs can be significant. Moreover, the laws governing our operations or the enforcement thereof could change in ways that substantially increase the costs of doing business. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
         Under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we also could be held liable for personal injuries, property damage (including site clean-up and restoration costs) and other damages including the assessment of natural resource damages. Such laws may impose strict as well as joint and several liability for environmental contamination, which could subject us to liability for the conduct of others or for our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such actions were taken. Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations also increase the costs to plan, design, drill, install, operate and abandon oil and natural gas wells. Moreover, public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years, and environmental organizations have opposed, with some success, certain drilling projects. Part of the regulatory environment in which we operate includes, in some cases, federal requirements for performing or preparing environmental assessments, environmental impact studies and/or plans of development before commencing exploration and production activities. In addition, our activities are subject to regulation by oil and natural gas producing states relating to conservation practices and protection of correlative rights. Such regulations affect our operations and limit the quantity of oil and natural gas we may produce and sell. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or necessary permits, the failure to obtain a permit or the receipt of a permit with excessive conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to explore on, develop or produce our properties. Additionally, the oil and natural gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase the financial and managerial costs to comply with the requirements of these laws and regulations and, consequently, adversely affect our profitability. By way of example, in 2015 the EPA lowered the primary national ambient air quality standard for ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. Implementation will take place over several years; however, the new standard eventually could result in more stringent emissions controls and additional permitting obligations for our operations. 
 40

     Part of our strategy involves drilling in shale formations, using horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our drilling program using these techniques may be subject to more uncertainties than conventional drilling programs, especially in areas that are new and emerging. These uncertainties could result in an inability to meet our expectations for reserves and production. 
         The results of our drilling in shale formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas have limited or no production history; consequently our predictions of drilling results in these areas are more uncertain. In addition, the use of horizontal drilling and completion techniques used in all of our shale formations involve certain risks and complexities that do not exist in conventional wells. The ultimate success of our drilling and completion strategies and techniques will be better evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are better established. 
         If our drilling results are less than anticipated our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate and could result in material write downs of unevaluated properties and future declines in the value of our undeveloped acreage. 
   Federal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays. 
         We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with many of the wells for which we are the operator. Federal, state and local governments have been adopting or considering restrictions on or prohibitions of fracturing in areas where we currently conduct operations, or in the future plan to conduct operations. Consequently, we could be subject to additional levels of regulation, operational delays or increased operating costs and could have additional regulatory burdens imposed upon us that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. 
         From time to time, for example, legislation has been proposed in Congress to amend the federal SDWA to require federal permitting of hydraulic fracturing and the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Further, the EPA issued a study in 2016 finding that hydraulic fracturing could potentially harm drinking water resources under adverse circumstances such as injection directly into groundwater or into production wells lacking mechanical integrity. Other governmental reviews have also been conducted that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing. Such activities eventually could result in additional regulatory scrutiny that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. 
         Certain states, including Texas where we conduct our operations, likewise are considering or have adopted more stringent requirements for various aspects of hydraulic fracturing operations, such as permitting, disclosure, air emissions, well construction, seismic monitoring, waste disposal and water use. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. Such efforts have extended to bans on hydraulic fracturing. 
         The proliferation of regulations may limit our ability to operate. If the use of hydraulic fracturing is limited, prohibited or subjected to further regulation, these requirements could delay or effectively prevent the extraction of oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

     Regulation related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for oil and natural gas. 
         Studies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth's atmosphere. In response, governments increasingly have been adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that require reporting and reductions of the emission of such greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, are considered greenhouse gases. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement address greenhouse gas emissions, and international negotiations over climate change and greenhouse gases are continuing. Meanwhile, several countries, including those comprising the European Union, have established greenhouse gas regulatory systems. 
         In the United States, many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through emission inventories, emission targets, greenhouse gas cap and trade programs or incentives for renewable energy generation, while others have considered adopting such greenhouse gas programs. 
         At the federal level, the Obama Administration addressed climate change through a variety of administrative actions. The EPA thus issued greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting regulations that cover oil and natural gas facilities, among other industries. Beyond measuring and reporting, the EPA issued an "Endangerment Finding" under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding certain greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The finding served as the first step to issuing regulations that require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities. In March 2014, moreover, then President Obama released a Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions that included consideration of both voluntary programs and targeted regulations for the oil and gas sector. Consistent with that strategy, the EPA issued final rules in 2016 for new and modified oil and gas production sources (including hydraulically fractured oil wells, natural gas well sites, natural gas processing plants, natural gas gathering and boosting stations and natural gas transmission sources) to reduce emissions of methane as well as volatile organic compound and toxic pollutants. In addition, the BLM has promulgated standards for reducing venting and flaring on public lands. The Trump Administration has been trying to roll back many of the Obama-era policies and rules, but those efforts have resulted in court challenges. At this point, the long-term direction of federal climate regulation is uncertain. 
         In the courts, several decisions have been issued that may increase the risk of claims being filed by governments and private parties against companies that have significant greenhouse gas emissions. Such cases may seek to challenge air emissions permits that greenhouse gas emitters apply for and seek to force emitters to reduce their emissions or seek damages for alleged climate change impacts to the environment, people, and property. 
         The direction of future U.S. climate change regulation is difficult to predict given the current uncertainties surrounding the policies of the Trump Administration. The EPA may or may not continue developing regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and gas industry. Even if federal efforts in this area slow, states may continue pursuing climate regulations. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur additional operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions controls, to obtain emission allowances or to pay emission taxes, and reduce demand for our products.

     Our operations substantially depend on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain, dispose of or recycle water may impact our ability to execute our drilling and development plans in a timely or cost-effective manner. 
         Water is an essential component of our drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Wastewaters from our operations typically are disposed of via underground injection. Some studies have linked earthquakes in certain areas to underground injection, which is leading to greater public scrutiny of disposal wells. Any new environmental initiatives or regulations that restrict injection of fluids, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and gas, or that limit the withdrawal, storage or use of surface water or ground water necessary for hydraulic fracturing of our wells, could increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or cessation of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, and all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
   The ongoing implementation of federal legislation enacted in 2010 could have an adverse impact on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effects of commodity prices, interest rates and other risks associated with our business. 
         We have entered into a number of commodity derivative contracts in order to hedge a portion of our oil and natural gas production. On July 21, 2010, then President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (or CFTC), along with other federal agencies, to promulgate regulations implementing the new legislation. 
         The CFTC has finalized other regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act's provisions regarding trade reporting, margin, clearing, and trade execution; however, some regulations remain to be finalized and it is not possible at this time to predict when the CFTC will adopt final rules. For example, the CFTC has re-proposed regulations setting position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions are expected to be made exempt from these limits. Also, it is possible that under recently adopted margin rules, some registered swap dealers may require us to post initial and variation margins in connection with certain swaps not subject to central clearing. 
         The Dodd-Frank Act and any additional implementing regulations could significantly increase the cost of some commodity derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral, which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of some commodity derivative contracts, limit our ability to trade some derivatives to hedge risks, reduce the availability of some derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, and reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing commodity derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a consequence, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. If the implementing regulations result in lower commodity prices, our revenues could be adversely affected. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

     We cannot be certain that the insurance coverage maintained by us will be adequate to cover all losses that may be sustained in connection with all oil and natural gas activities. 
         We maintain general and excess liability policies, which we consider to be reasonable and consistent with industry standards. These policies generally cover:
 

 personal injury; 
 bodily injury; 
 third party property damage; 
 medical expenses; 
 legal defense costs; 
 pollution in some cases; 
 well blowouts in some cases; and 
 workers compensation. 

         As is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage that we maintain will be sufficient to cover claims made against us in the future. 
   Title to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects. 
         We generally obtain title opinions on significant properties that we drill or acquire. However, there is no assurance that we will not suffer a monetary loss from title defects or title failure. Additionally, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. Generally, under the terms of the operating agreements affecting our properties, any monetary loss is to be borne by all parties to any such agreement in proportion to their interests in such property. If there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we will suffer a financial loss. 
   Our financial results following the sale of our Williston Basin and El Halcón assets will not be comparable to our historical financial results and historical trends may not be indicative of our future results. 
         We divested substantially all of our proved reserves and production when we sold our Williston Basin and El Halcón assets in 2017. The dispositions of these assets, combined with our other recent acquisition and divestiture activities, have substantially transformed us into a pure-play, single-basin company focused on developing largely unproven acreage concentrated in the Delaware Basin in West Texas. Our historical financial information in this report includes the operations of our Williston Basin and El Halcón assets and does not reflect the operations of our Delaware Basin assets in all periods. As a result, our historical financial results will not be comparable to our future results and historical trends may not be indicative of results to be expected in future periods. 
   Our pending acquisition of the West Quito Draw Properties may not close as anticipated or may close with adjusted terms, and we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition. 
         Our pending acquisition of the West Quito Draw Properties, as described under "BusinessRecent DevelopmentsPending acquisition of the West Quito Draw Properties," is expected to close in early April 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived, 
 44

   we will not complete the acquisition. We cannot assure you that the acquisition of the West Quito Draw Properties will close on our expected timeframe, or at all, or close without material adjustments. 
         Even if we complete the acquisition of the West Quito Draw Properties, we may not realize the expected benefits. Acquisitions are subject to various risks and uncertainties, discussed in detail elsewhere herein, and the purchase agreement for the West Quito Draw Properties limits our recourse against the seller for various losses and liabilities arising or discovered after closing. See "BusinessRecent DevelopmentsPending acquisition of the West Quito Draw Properties," for more information. 
   Hedging transactions may limit our potential gains and increase our potential losses. 
         In order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production, we have entered into oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our anticipated production and we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile commodity prices, such transactions may limit our potential gains and increase our potential losses if commodity prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:
 

 our production is less than expected; 
 there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production; or 
 the counterparties to our hedging agreements fail to perform under the contracts. 

   Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and realized built in losses to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation. 
         In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation that undergoes an "ownership change" is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (NOLs), and realized built in losses (RBILS), to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% stockholders, applying certain look-through rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders' lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). 
         We experienced an ownership change in September 2016 as a result of the consummation of our plan of reorganization under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and we may experience additional ownership changes in the future. Limitations imposed on our ability to use NOLs and RBILS to offset future taxable income may cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs and RBILS to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs and RBILS. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. 
   U.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us. 
         On December 22, 2017, the president signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act) which enacts a broad range of changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The 2017 Tax Act, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest and net operating losses, allows for the expensing of certain capital expenditures, and limits the deductibility of certain types of executive compensation. We will continue to assess the impact of the new tax legislation on our net deferred tax assets and liabilities and will continue to examine the impact this tax legislation may have on our business.

     We depend on computer and telecommunications systems and failures in our systems or cyber security attacks could significantly disrupt our business operations. 
         We have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology services in connection with our business. In addition, we have developed proprietary software systems, management techniques and other information technologies incorporating software licensed from third parties. It is possible we could incur interruptions from cyber security attacks, computer viruses or malware. We believe that we have positive relations with our related vendors and maintain adequate anti-virus and malware software and controls; however, any interruptions to our arrangements with third parties to our computing and communications infrastructure or our information systems could significantly disrupt our business operations. 
   Our actual financial results may vary materially from the projections that we filed with the bankruptcy court in connection with the confirmation of our plan of reorganization. 
         In connection with the disclosure statement we filed with the bankruptcy court, and the hearing to consider confirmation of our plan of reorganization, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the bankruptcy court the feasibility of the plan of reorganization and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance and with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results will likely vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. As a result, investors should not rely on these projections. 
   Our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future financial performance. 
         Effective upon our emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 9, 2016, we adopted fresh-start accounting, as a consequence of which our assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair values and we had no beginning or ending retained earnings or deficit balances on that date. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy will not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. Further, as a result of the implementation of our plan of reorganization and the transactions contemplated thereby, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future financial performance.
