Marketing.

Benchtop Laboratory Equipment. The Company’s Benchtop Laboratory Equipment products sold under the “Genie” brand are generally distributed and marketed through an established network of domestic and overseas laboratory equipment distributors who sell the Company’s products through websites, printed catalogs and sales force. In general, due to the reliance on sales through distribution, it takes two to three years for a new Genie brand Benchtop Laboratory Equipment product to begin generating meaningful sales.

The Company’s “Torbal®” brand weighing products are primarily marketed and sold online, and primarily on a direct basis, with only a few distributors. The Company’s VIVID® brand, automated pill counter is sold through two exclusive distributors in North America. The Company markets its products through online and trade publication advertising, brochures and catalogs, the Company’s websites, one sales manager in the U.S., a consultant in Europe and, when practicable, attendance at industry trade shows.

Bioprocessing Systems. The Company’s Bioprocessing Systems products are marketed under a newly created marketing category “Digitally Simplified Bioprocessing” through a direct sales force consisting of ten sales professionals and application scientists plus one distributor. Sales are supported via marketing through websites, content creation, application notes, mailings, trade shows, online marketing campaigns, and membership in various public/private research partnerships.
Assembly and Production. The Company has facilities in Bohemia, New York and Orangeburg, New York where it conducts the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment operations. The Company also has an operating facility in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and in Baesweiller, Germany, where it conducts the Bioprocessing Systems operations.
