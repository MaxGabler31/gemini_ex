Item 1. Business
Overview 
We are the leading digital platform for U.S. medical professionals, as measured by the number of U.S. physician members, with over two million medical professional members as of March 31, 2022. Our members include more than 80% of physicians across all 50 states and every medical specialty, as well as over 50% of U.S. nurse practitioners and physician assistants, and over 90% of graduating U.S. medical students. 
Our mission is to help every physician be more productive and provide better care for their patients. We are physicians-first, putting technology to work for doctors instead of the other way around. That guiding principle has enabled Doximity to become an essential and trusted professional platform for physicians. Doximity’s physician cloud puts modern software tools in the hands of physicians and other medical professionals. We provide our members with capabilities specifically built for medical professionals, enabling them to collaborate with their colleagues, securely coordinate patient care, conduct virtual patient visits, stay up-to-date with the latest medical news and research, and manage their careers. 
At the core of our platform is the largest medical professional network in the nation, which creates proximity within our community of doctors and hundreds of thousands of other medical professionals. Our focus on clinician-centric product design and productivity has led to high levels of health professional adoption and endorsement. For example, we had over 350,000 unique active providers use our telehealth tools in the quarter ended March 31, 2022. 
Our business model is designed to both respect and support physicians while driving value for our customers through our Marketing, Hiring, and Telehealth Solutions (see defined below). Our revenue-generating customers, primarily pharmaceutical manufacturers and health systems, have access to a suite of commercial solutions that benefit from broad physician usage. 
Our “Marketing Solutions” enable our pharmaceutical and health system customers to get the right content, services, and peer connections to the right medical professionals through a variety of modules. Our Marketing Solutions deliver high engagement and high value and help those customers embrace the shift to digital marketing. We count the top pharmaceutical manufacturers and hospitals and health systems as our customers.
Our “Hiring Solutions” provide digital recruiting capabilities to health systems and medical recruiting firms, enabling them to identify, connect with, and hire from our network of both active and passive potential medical professional candidates, who might otherwise be missed through traditional recruiting channels. 
Our “Telehealth Solutions”, which are software tools that include voice and video Dialer, are designed to easily connect patients with care providers. Our Dialer tool has powered over 100 million virtual patient visits since launch. 
The ecosystem we have created in the medical community benefits from powerful network effects. Medical professional engagement with our platform increases as the breadth and utility of our tools expands, attracting even more members and driving broader and more effective communication and collaboration among healthcare professionals. This also drives greater value for our pharmaceutical and health system customers that seek to interact with specific groups of physicians. In turn, the insights that we gain from increased use of our platform enable us to invest in improving our tools and solutions to meet the changing needs of our members, customers, and the patients that they care for, ultimately creating a win-win-win for all constituents in our ecosystem. 
Our member interactions have enabled us to build a vast, interactive data set intelligently combining proprietary information and previously-siloed public information. When coupled with our customized algorithms and our team of analysts, engineers, and clinical experts, we believe this gives us unique, unparalleled insight into the specific needs of medical professionals in the United States that would be highly challenging and time consuming for any competitor to replicate.
Our Tools for Medical Professionals
The Doximity platform is free to join and use for U.S. medical professionals. Becoming a member of Doximity is as simple as navigating to our homepage or downloading our mobile app, and entering a first and last name and verifying real-name identity by National Prescriber Identifier, Social Security Number, Drug Enforcement Administration Registration Number, or medical email account confirmation. Our technology platform provides most medical professionals with a pre-populated profile using publicly and commercially available third-party data which members can further supplement, update, and refine.
Once verified, members gain access to our network, newsfeed, and—depending on their credentials—core features of our productivity tools, including telehealth. 
Our Professional Network
•Profile. Members have a personalized and validated professional profile on the Doximity network that acts as a digital curriculum vitae. Profile information includes education and training, hospital affiliations and practice contact as well as information, certifications and licenses, specialization and clinical expertise, links to published research reports and press mentions, clinical trial participation, and any awards conferred. Our technology automatically searches for and updates new information on a daily basis. Members may also choose to share personal contact information (such as email or cell phone number) with other medical professionals on an individual, opt-in basis, each time they make a connection with another member.
•Connectivity with colleagues. Our network makes it easy for professionals to connect and stay in touch with the broader medical community. We regularly suggest new connections to members, such as co-residents, co-fellows, co-authors, colleagues from the same hospital or practice, and medical school classmates, enabling referrals, sharing of medical knowledge, and career opportunities.
•Search. Members can use our powerful search technology to find other medical professionals by name, specialty, expertise, affiliation, or location. For example, a physician may have a patient with a chronic condition that requires specialist care at another health system or in another state. The physician can use our search tool to find the right expert for a right chronic condition at the closest health system, and potentially leverage mutual connections for a warm introduction. 
•Careers. Our platform provides numerous tools that empower physicians to manage their careers effectively from training through retirement. 
◦For practicing physicians. Members can browse permanent and locum tenens opportunities, set up job alerts to stay abreast of career opportunities matching their interests, and directly connect with our Hiring Solutions customers. Members also have access to detailed job market data, such as our Salary Map, which provides a first-of-its-kind county-level look at physician compensation trends across specialties and geographies. 
◦For students and residents. Members beginning their medical careers can discover and compare training programs across the country using Residency Navigator, a tool which provides a transparent look into U.S. medical residency programs, powered by peer nominations, ratings, and hand-written reviews, giving medical students the tools they need to navigate their future in medicine and to help choose the right program for their career goals. We do not accept fees or payments from hospitals or medical residency programs to impact their ranking or visibility on Residency Navigator. Residency Navigator serves as a relationship funnel for new members at the beginning of their medical careers. Over 90% of graduating U.S. medical students join Doximity to use tools including Residency Navigator before earning their medical degree.
Newsfeed
Our newsfeed serves as the personalized, curated home screen for each member when they sign on to the Doximity platform. We leverage artificial intelligence, or AI, including machine learning, or ML, to create a personalized and curated newsfeed for each of our members. Our platform provides access, free of charge to all of our members, to content from a variety of internal and third-party sources, including content created in-house and content linked to third-party sites (some of which may require a separate subscription).
•Medical articles. Our platform uses both algorithms and clinical editors to select content from a variety of sources based on a member’s profile and reading interests. Information used to select articles includes each member’s specialties, qualifications, connections, and content preferences, along with what is popular across our network at that time. We are able to aggregate connections to relevant content from a variety of different sources, such as medical journals and specialist websites that a member might otherwise have to search for separately.
•Medical videos. Information about recent clinical trials or research results are distributed in an easy-to-consume video format, optimized for desktop or mobile viewing. Videos are designed to be brief, relevant and eye-catching to disseminate knowledge without wasting a physician’s time.
•Continuing Medical Education, or CME, credit. Our platform automatically tracks the articles that our members read, logging eligible CME credit for them as they go.
•Peer and colleague updates. Doximity members can stay abreast of and celebrate the professional updates and accomplishments of their peers and colleagues, from new jobs to awards, newly authored publications, and press mentions.
•Clinical discussions. Members can comment on and react to posts directly in their newsfeed. For example, members might discuss the results of a new clinical study, or even ask questions to the author of that study. Members can also submit for publication Op-Med articles, which is long-form content written by clinicians for clinicians, covering topics such as front-line experiences and practice-changing viewpoints. Ultimately, dialogue and interactive elements drive engagement within the ecosystem and facilitate peer-to-peer education.
•Sponsored content. Certain articles and videos are marked as sponsored content and are designed to be highly relevant to our members. These can appear to our members and are created in concert with our pharmaceutical and health systems customers and may include information about medications, clinical trials, guidelines and resources, and trends in medical and patient care. They are developed in collaboration with our customer success team to ensure they meet the high quality standards of our community.
Productivity
Members of our platform are able to access our productivity tools, a suite of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, compliant communication and digital workflow tools that are designed with their needs in mind to make their daily workflows more efficient. We put the following critical digital tools in one easy-to-use app and website. 
•Digital Fax and eSignature. Allows physicians to send and receive HIPAA-compliant faxes through our mobile app or website. Members can electronically sign, edit, date, add attachments, and customize the cover page for their faxed documents, eliminating the need to print, manually sign, and re-scan documents. This streamlines patient care coordination and digital record keeping. 
•Secure Messaging. Enables members to collaborate securely regarding patient consultations, and coordinate care across multiple care team members, specialists, systems, or locations. 
•Dialer. Our members can connect with their patients through our Dialer telehealth feature through Dialer Free, which is available for free to all members, through Dialer Pro, a paid version with some enhanced capacities, or Dialer Enterprise, which may be purchased by a hospital enterprise. Physicians can either initiate the visits in the Doximity app, or use the leading EHR app, Haiku by Epic, to find a patient’s information and start a visit with one tap, under an enterprise license. Dialer visits can be either voice or video based. Voice visits allow physicians to pre-set their Caller ID to their office number, which maintains the privacy of their personal line while increasing the likelihood that the patient will answer so that they can efficiently connect on-the-go. Video visits allow physicians to convert their smartphone and desktop to a telemedicine hub, without any extra download or sign in required for patients. Additional convenient features are accessible during a video call, such as the ability to easily add an interpreter or family member, or hand off the call to another member of the care team with one click, all in a HIPAA-compliant manner.
Our Solutions for Healthcare Customers
We offer Marketing, Hiring, and Telehealth Solutions to pharmaceutical manufacturers, health systems, medical recruiting firms, and certain other healthcare companies on a predominantly subscription basis. In fiscal 2022, we had 265 customers which contributed at least $100,000 of subscription revenue. Our solutions focus on win-wins for our customers and our members, containing useful and relevant information for the physician's particular area of practice and their patients’ needs, while being respectful of their time.
Marketing Solutions
We provide a digital marketing platform for pharmaceutical manufacturers and health systems to serve our members with tailored content that is highly relevant to their clinical practices. Pharmaceutical manufacturers purchase programs on a brand-by-brand basis, and health systems execute programs on a service line by service line basis. Service lines in health systems refer to patient-centric clinical specialties, such as cardiology, oncology, neurology, and otolaryngology, among others. 
Our customers are able to specify a combination of audience attributes, such as specialty, credential, and location, and also choose modules. Modules are the core building blocks of the marketing plan and are additive to one another. We package them into programs to meet the needs of individual brands and service lines. Our modules can be categorized as Awareness, Interactivity, and Peer, as follows:
•Awareness: modules that generate awareness and build name recognition, such as text and video articles. The content of these modules may include updates on how certain drugs perform in clinical trials, the opening of new hospitals or departments within a health system, or other information that is relevant to our members.
•Interactivity: modules that enable digital activities such as conference attendance, connecting with a sales representative, booking an appointment, or ordering product samples.
•Peer: modules that enable our members to connect and build professional relationships with thought-leaders, department chairs, and other experts within the Doximity network.
We seek to develop new modules in response to customer feedback and market trends and to address specific needs of our customers. For example, an Interactivity module may appear adjacent to articles about scientific congresses or professional meetings. 
Our goal is to make sponsored content useful, relevant, and informative for our members. We have a customer success team that ensures both that our customers receive tangible, measurable, and repeatable benefits from their marketing spend, and that our members have access to sponsored content that is relevant and informative. The team works directly with our customers to deeply understand a customer’s goals, priorities, and messaging before helping with content and media formats. Our team can develop new content or fine-tune and reformat existing content for digital and feed-friendly marketing. We also provide ongoing support and reporting at the customer’s request.
We have become a valued collaborator to our customers. We have a track record of expanding throughout the medication portfolios of pharmaceutical customers and into additional service lines throughout a health system while also upselling additional modules. 
Hiring Solutions
We offer our Hiring Solutions to both health systems and medical recruiting firms, which pay for subscriptions that provide them with the ability to search and connect with medical professionals on Doximity. Our AI and ML-supported platform enables customers to run highly targeted hiring campaigns across a range of medical specialties and sub-specialties, uncovering passive but eligible candidates for proactive outreach on any locum tenens or permanent position. 
Our modules for Hiring Solutions consist of the following:
•Job posts. Individual listings on our platform for open jobs, either posted directly by a health system or by a recruiting firm. Our members can search and browse these listings. 
•Direct message. Recruiters, physicians, and administrators can direct message members who might be a good fit for a given open position. These messages may or may not be for an opening that has been posted on our job posts.
Both job posts and direct messages are sold as a subscription that entitles the customer to a certain number of job listings or messages on a self-serve basis throughout the contract period. 
We also have a tech-enabled, higher-touch Hiring Solution called Curative, combining Doximity’s data science and intelligence with the service of Curative’s customer-focused recruiters. Our account managers at Curative work with health systems to source both locum tenens and permanent staffing, leveraging our platform and providing a higher level of support on an ongoing basis than our self-service Hiring Solutions. Health systems enter into a contract with Curative on an hourly-fee or a placement-fee basis.
Telehealth Solutions for Health Systems
We provide Dialer Enterprise to health systems and hospitals seeking an accessible but powerful telehealth solution. The organic adoption of our direct-to-member offerings—Dialer Free and Dialer Pro— is an important factor driving our Enterprise offerings. Many users have already adopted Dialer into their regular workflow and this familiarity significantly streamlines implementation when health systems are deploying Dialer Enterprise while competitor solutions often require a full physician training.
Dialer Enterprise enables unlimited access to Dialer for all users across a health system’s organization, and unlocks the same premium feature set as Dialer Pro with an added service layer for the organization that includes a dedicated customer success manager, premium user support, and monthly utilization reporting. Health system customers also have the opportunity to brand the user and patient experience as well as leverage their own security and HIPAA requirements to create consistent 
protocols for use. Our health system team can also integrate Dialer into our customer's electronic medical record system so that their users can access Dialer from directly within their existing clinical workflows.
Dialer Enterprise is sold as a subscription, with pricing based on the size of the health system. 
Scheduling Capabilities for Health Systems
On April 1, 2022, we closed our acquisition of the AMiON shift scheduling service to further expand our physician cloud platform. Our AMiON shift scheduling tool helps health systems easily manage care coverage across their business units, by enabling administrators and staff to view work schedules, communicate with colleagues, swap and adjust shifts, and sync work shifts to personal calendars.
Our Strengths
Our business exhibits a number of key strengths which we believe position us to drive sustained growth. 
•We are the trusted and secure physician-first platform. Since our founding, Doximity has been built to be physician-first, with trust at the core of what we do. We verify the identities and qualifications of our medical professionals through integration with third-party databases. In addition, our communications solutions are HIPAA compliant, providing medical professionals with a critical platform for protected communications.
•We have the largest digital network of medical professionals. Our members have the broadest available range of professional connections and networking opportunities through our platform, and we believe we have become the primary physician-to-physician connectivity medium. The scale and strength of our network has made us a strategic collaborator of choice for pharmaceutical manufacturers and health systems. We enable these organizations to engage with a valuable and otherwise difficult-to-reach audience, covering an increasing number of specialized medical professionals and enabling targeted outreach.
•We benefit from powerful network effects. Both the medical professionals and customers that use our platform benefit immensely from access to our large and dynamic ecosystem, and we fuel the expansion of this network of medical professionals, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and health systems by adding new tools and solutions to our platform. As we expand our capabilities, Doximity becomes more attractive to new and existing members and customers, ultimately generating more data and insights that allow us to develop better tools and solutions, and build greater scale. 
•We are deeply embedded in physician workflows. Our tools and third-party integrations are designed to solve workflow pain-points for physicians. Our tools provide physicians with the ability to deliver best-in-class healthcare, spend more time with patients, and ultimately improve patient care. 
•We innately understand physician workflows are different from traditional technology workflows. Through having product leaders who are physicians, designers, and engineers familiar with healthcare services, and an extended team of medical professionals in our advisory committees, we are able to build solutions that enable physicians and act as an extension of their practice. 
•We are strategic to our customers. We provide a unique, digital channel to connect with the most valuable professionals in healthcare. Pharmaceutical manufacturers and health systems gain access to a high value solution. Health systems and medical recruiting firms gain access to a comprehensive nationwide network and database of specialty and sub-specialty professionals. We align our goals with our customers and help them make the necessary leap to digital. 
Our Growth Strategies
•Grow the Doximity Network. While we will continue to grow our number of physician members, we are under-penetrated among other types of medical professionals such as nurse practitioners, and have an opportunity to expand our offering to physical therapists, dentists, psychologists, and many other professions. As more medical professionals join our platform, we become a more valuable connectivity tool for members, and a more valuable marketing and hiring channel for pharmaceutical manufacturers and health systems. 
•Continuously improve and innovate on our platform. Improving our existing capabilities, and innovating to add new tools and solutions, will make our platform more valuable to members, helping to attract new members and customers, while increasing the engagement of existing ones. 
•Expand within customers of our solutions. Our existing customers represent a significant opportunity to grow our platform. Many of our large pharmaceutical customers initially run marketing programs for a certain number of brands but have a track record of increasing their spend with us both by adding modules and expanding across more of their portfolio of brands once they have seen the quantifiable benefits of our Marketing Solutions. Health systems have a similar track record of expanding their usage of our platform across different service lines. 
•Attract new customers. We have an opportunity to engage additional pharmaceutical manufacturers and health systems as we raise awareness of our offerings through our sales and marketing efforts and as we expand our offerings.
•Further monetize our Telehealth Solutions. Our telehealth tools are used and trusted by hundreds of thousands of our members, and the rapid adoption by health systems of our commercial Telehealth Solution, Dialer Enterprise, reflects that professional trust. Our Dialer Enterprise solution is still in its early stages and we have significant whitespace ahead of us. 
•Grow our patient-facing tools. Patients can search for the right doctor or hospital for their needs through our collaboration with the Doctor Finder tool of U.S. News & World Report, which publicly displays summary physician profiles and hospital rankings powered by an integration with our Doximity network. We also collaborate with U.S. News & World Report to offer a direct-to-patient scheduling tool for health systems. We see opportunities to expand our offerings to patients in the future. Consumers on the platform would also create a significant value opportunity for our customers. 
•Consider strategic acquisitions to expand our platform capabilities. In the past, we have selectively used mergers and acquisitions to accelerate our product roadmap to bring medical professionals and customers more complete solutions and increase demand for our products. For example, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, or fiscal 2021, we acquired Curative Talent, a medical recruiting agency, in order to augment our Hiring Solutions with a tech-enabled, higher-touch service, and on April 1, 2022 we closed our acquisition of the AMiON shift scheduling service to further expand our physician cloud platform. We plan to continue evaluating similar opportunities and execute on them if we find the right fit for our members, customers, and our company.
Our Technology Platform
Our technology platform supports a vast network of member connections, with regularly updated profiles, secure communication and productivity tools, and vast amounts of searchable indexed data. Together, we believe these features of our physician cloud form a valuable competitive strength. 
Platform Advantages
•Extensive and dynamic database of U.S. physician information: Since the launch of our business, members have interacted with each other and our technology platform hundreds of millions of times. This has enabled us to build a vast, interactive data set intelligently combining proprietary information and previously siloed public information. Along with user-entered input, our proprietary algorithms constantly identify new information for our members from hundreds of third party sources that are isolated and siloed in the healthcare space. The up-to-date and scaled nature of our database is critical to the value proposition for both our members and our pharmaceutical manufacturer and health system customers. 
•Statistical and machine learning methodologies: We utilize proprietary statistical and machine learning methodologies across our platform for a number of use cases to benefit our members. Some of the major components include:
•Aggregating and coupling disjointed datasets from numerous medical sources into a live database of physician information to perform descriptive, diagnostic, and prescriptive analysis. 
•Medical news tailored to a member’s specific specialty, clinical areas of interest, and viewing history, ensuring that each member’s news feed is personalized to them and that the digital marketing content of our pharmaceutical and health system customers will be served to members that are more likely to find it relevant and interesting based on their profile and viewing history.
•Automatically matching top candidates with openings offered by recruiters and administrators based on job history, interests, and geography.
•Extensive, interactive database of U.S. medical residency and employment data: We collect and maintain a vast repository of residency and employment data from our members, which includes member reviews on their experience at hospitals and residency programs, detailed statistics on user experiences regarding program setting and training environment, and a salary map across different specialties and geographies across the country. We make this data available to all of our members in easily accessible portals which are automatically updated as our members provide additional data on the platform. 
•Proprietary productivity and telehealth tools: Our productivity and telehealth tools have been built to be physician-first with usability in mind at every step. Built on top of a modern software stack that ensures rapid scalability and enterprise-grade reliability, our tools allow doctors to communicate via messages, voice, and video—and their patients do not need to install an app to be connected. On top of this base service, we have designed a broad range of customized, physician-first telehealth features specific to our platform such as ‘call nudge’ reminding a patient of a visit, ‘straight to voicemail’ enabling physicians to choose not to disturb patients after-hours, and the flexibility to switch between voice and video at will, among others.
•Design Principles: Our technology stack and product development teams are set up to enable rapid prototyping and development of new features via controlled rollouts. We focus on innovative, useful and unobtrusive features that are designed to optimize the healthcare professional’s workflow. And at all times, we follow the stringent security and privacy requirements of a physician’s data; our messaging tools are compliant with HIPAA and validated through external auditing procedures.
Sales and Marketing
We employ a direct sales organization composed of highly trained team members. The sales organization is segmented primarily by customer type. For example, there is one enterprise-focused team concentrating on pharmaceutical manufacturers and another concentrated on health systems. Our direct sales organization also reaches customers through indirect channels, such as third-party marketing agencies utilized by our pharmaceutical and health system customers. 
The direct sales organization is supported by marketing and customer success specialists. We generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities, and build brand awareness through our marketing programs, both digitally and offline. These programs target decision makers to provide information about our company and solutions through digital advertising, field marketing events, integrated marketing programs (including direct email and online advertising), industry events, trade shows, and conferences. Our customer success team supports customer retention by working directly with customers to produce higher engagement with our solutions, which in turn expands their use of the platform in the future.
We buy a limited amount of digital search and display advertising on Google and Facebook to encourage potential members to sign up for our platform.
Competition
Although we have built a scaled and highly differentiated platform, we face competition across different aspects of our business. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition from a number of companies, and we expect such competition to increase as our industry evolves. Specifically, we compete for medical professionals as members, and for pharmaceutical and health system companies as customers for our Marketing, Hiring, and Telehealth Solutions. 
•Competing for members: We compete with large technology companies that have developed online networking and collaboration tools such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Google, and Twitter, in addition to smaller, emerging companies. However, we believe we are the only professional network solely dedicated to medical professionals, with a purpose-built platform to address their networking, collaboration, content, educational, and career management needs.
•Competing for customers: We compete across several categories to access spend in the healthcare category. We specifically compete for access to marketing, hiring, and telehealth budgets. We believe that our platform and the network of medical professionals on Doximity allow us to provide our customers with solutions that result in attractive returns on their marketing and hiring budgets. 
◦Marketing: We compete with online and offline outlets that provide marketing and advertising services that enable pharmaceutical manufacturers and health systems to educate medical professionals about their brands. These outlets include health-related websites and mobile apps. 
◦Hiring: We compete in the healthcare staffing industry with job boards, self-service recruiting tools, and medical recruiting firms in national, regional, and local markets. We compete with large healthcare staffing companies as well as smaller, more regionally focused companies. 
◦Telehealth: We compete with other providers of telehealth services, such as Teladoc Health and Amwell, in addition to smaller, emerging companies that provide telehealth services on behalf of employers and insurance plans. In addition, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen increased competition from broader video communication solutions, such as Zoom Video Communications. 
The industries in which our products are offered are evolving rapidly and are becoming increasingly competitive. Larger and more established companies may focus on our market and could directly compete with us. Smaller companies, including application developers, could also launch new products and services that compete with us and that could gain market acceptance quickly. We also expect our existing competitors in the markets for Marketing and Hiring Solutions to continue to focus on these areas. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, and other resources than we do and greater name recognition and more established distribution networks and relationships with healthcare providers than us. As a result, many of these companies may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and standards and changes in customer requirements. These companies may be able to invest more resources in research and development, strategic acquisitions, sales and marketing, patent prosecution, litigation, and financing capital equipment acquisitions for their customers.
Our competitors may announce new products, services, or enhancements that better address changing industry standards or the needs of members and customers, such as mobile access. Any such increased competition could cause pricing pressure, loss of market share or decreased member engagement, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Internet search engines could also change their methodologies in ways that adversely affect our ability to optimize our page rankings within their search results. If this occurs, our ability to successfully market our services to customers may be harmed and our business results may suffer.
Our People, Culture, Values, and Human Capital Resources
At Doximity, we organize our teams into small, nimble groups that operate autonomously and are empowered to make decisions quickly and who aim to stay close to our members and customers. We prioritize diversity and inclusion, and regularly track our progress against quantifiable goals. We have always been a geographically distributed team: over three-quarters of our employees were already working remotely prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. We supplement our workforce with contractors and consultants in the United States and internationally.
We champion the following core values: 
•Get Stuff Done: We are doers. We solve problems everyday by treating obstacles like an adventure. 
•Straight Talk: We say what we think and every voice is heard and respected. Transparency makes us stronger.
•Stretch Goals: Innovation requires risk taking. We challenge assumptions and shoot for the stars.
•Bring the Real You: We bring our quirky, unique selves to work. Diverse personalities create a more interesting and creative environment.
We and certain of our employees also volunteer time with a number of charity initiatives, including the Dox Foundation, which was formed by our Chief Executive Officer and his family. The Dox Foundation’s work includes helping clinicians reach underserved communities by funding flights for medical mission trips and providing grants to applicants. Applicants have traveled to Uganda, Cambodia, India, Myanmar, and the West Indies to provide services as diverse as cleft lip and palate surgery, orthopedic surgery education, and nursing education at a children’s hospital. 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain, and motivate selected employees, consultants, and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards. To our knowledge, none of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
As of March 31, 2022, we had a total of 887 full-time equivalent employees. More than 35% of our full-time equivalent employees work in R&D, including in product, engineering, and data. 
Data Protection, Security, and Regulatory Compliance
The data we collect and process is an integral part of our tools and solutions, allowing us to ensure our members are verified, the experience we provide is engaging and personalized, and the content we present is the most relevant. In addition, our business is subject to extensive, complex, and rapidly changing federal and state laws and regulations governing data collection, healthcare regulation, financial services laws, regulations and rules, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, and related matters. Our respect for laws and regulations regarding the collection and processing of personal data underlies our strategy to improve our member experience and build trust in our network and platform. While we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, these regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations may change periodically. Federal and state legislatures also may enact various legislative proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of our business. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business— We are subject to stringent and changing laws, regulations, self-regulatory schemes, contractual obligations, and standards related to privacy, data protection, and information security. The actual or perceived failure by us, our customers, partners, or vendors to comply with such obligations could harm our reputation, subject us to significant fines and liability, or otherwise adversely affect our business.”
Data Collection and Protection
We collect and may use personal information to help run our business (including for analytical purposes) and to communicate and otherwise reach our network members. In some instances, we may use third-party service providers to assist us in these efforts.
We endeavor to treat our members’ data with respect and maintain member trust. We provide our members with options designed to allow them to control their data, such as allowing our members to decide which profile contact information is viewable publicly and which is accessible to new connections. Members can also request deletion of their data under applicable privacy laws and procedures. Our privacy and security teams are devoted to processing and fulfilling member requests regarding access to and deletion of their data. 
Physician information that is posted to profiles is protected with anti-scraping technologies such as a Web Application Firewall, Runtime Application Self-Protection, Bot Protection, Rate-Limiting, and our network employs DDoS mitigation technology to protect against attacks. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using TLS 1.2, and personal health information is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption. Along with a dedicated in-house security team and contracted security researchers, we maintain a comprehensive HackerOne program for proactive vulnerability inspection of our entire offering.
U.S. state and federal health information privacy and security laws
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personally identifiable information, including health information. In particular, HIPAA established privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information, referred to as PHI, and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. Our members as well as certain of our enterprise customers are regulated as covered entities under HIPAA. As a service provider who creates, receives, maintains, or transmits PHI on behalf of these covered entities for certain of our services, Doximity is a “business associate” as defined under HIPAA. 
Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties and a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. In the event of a breach, we must also comply with HIPAA’s breach notification rule and our covered entity enterprise customers may require we provide assistance in the breach notification process and may seek indemnification and other contractual remedies. State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states, and individuals have used HIPAA standards as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance.
Further, many states in which we operate and in which our members and customers as well as their patients reside also have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information, information regarding mental health and substance use treatment, and other information related to the provision of healthcare services. Some of these laws also prohibit unfair privacy and security practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security place specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, the laws of the State of California, in which we operate, are more restrictive than HIPAA, including the provisions of the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect January 1, 2020. While any information we maintain in our role as a business associate may be exempt from the CCPA, 
other records and information we maintain on our members may be subject to the CCPA. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA or require us to take action such as breach notification, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to, in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but also some, unlike HIPAA, may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. In addition, state laws are changing rapidly, and there is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law, to which we may be subject.

Federal and State Telecommunications Laws
There are a number of federal and state laws and regulations potentially applicable to communications by phone, text message, or facsimile, including the TCPA, and those laws and regulations are continuously evolving. Our services that allow members and other platform users to leverage such telephonic communications may be subject to these laws and regulations.
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations and Health Reform
There are many laws that govern the activities of healthcare professionals, some of which may be applied to us because of our relationships with them. Some of these requirements may apply to us even if we do not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on our agreements with providers licensed in the state. Many states limit the scope of business relationships between business entities and medical professionals. For example, while many states’ fee-splitting laws only prohibit a physician from sharing medical fees with a referral source, some states have interpreted certain management agreements between business entities and physicians as unlawful fee-splitting. These laws generally prohibit us from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians and non-physician healthcare providers and from engaging in certain financial arrangements, such as splitting professional fees with healthcare providers. In addition, certain federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws may apply to us indirectly through our arrangements with healthcare professionals and entities. Statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine, anti-kickback, fraud, fee-splitting, and similar issues vary widely from state to state. Because these laws are often vague, their application is frequently dependent on court rulings and attorney general opinions. 
In addition, there have been several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed reforms of the healthcare system to contain costs, improve quality, and expand access to care. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our provider customers, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, the need to make changes to the terms of engagement of our provider customers that interfere with our business, and other materially adverse consequences.

Intellectual Property 
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, as well as other legal and contractual rights, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. However, our contractual provisions may not always be effective at preventing unauthorized parties from obtaining our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. In addition, though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the market.
As of March 31, 2022, we have four provisional patent applications in the United States. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names, product names, and logos in the United States to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. As of March 31, 2022, we have a total of seven registered or applied-for trademarks in the United States and two registered trademarks in non-U.S. jurisdictions. We also have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.doximity.com and other variations.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition, if we were to expand internationally, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. We may be dependent on third-
party content, technology, and intellectual property in connection with our business. We expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increase. In addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims from third parties. Any third-party intellectual property claims against us could significantly increase our expenses and could have a significant and negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Seasonality 
Historically, we have experienced some seasonality based on the timing of marketing programs, subscription launches on our platform and budgetary timing of purchases of additional modules.
