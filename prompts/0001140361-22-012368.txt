FOCUS FOR 2022
 
Early in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, the end markets that we serve, the power industries, delayed certain essential services and dramatically cut back on non-essential services. Although this impacted us, as an essential services provider to an essential industrial base, we benefited from maintaining a baseline of business to continue and align itself to the realities of the pandemic. Additionally, as the pandemic effects started to wane, resulting staffing shortages in industry resulted in new opportunities for our Workforce Solutions segment (further defined below under Operating Segments). In 2021, the effects of the pandemic continued to impact the end markets we serve, but those effects were mitigated by a number of factors, including the following: the pandemic largely has had a targeted effect on the population; the availability of vaccines to address COVID-19 and, despite logistical challenges, making solid progress for those in most need; the economy of the United States has not had as much disruption as was initially feared which has benefited our end markets; and most importantly our end markets seem poised to spend to catch up on essential services that had been delayed as a result of the pandemic. As we concluded 2021 and entered 2022, we achieved several, significant contract “wins” that we publicly announced. We are optimistic that both the opportunities and successes are a harbinger of a more attractive business environment for the power industries that we serve.
 
As we look ahead to 2022 and beyond, with a new administration in the United States, there is renewed focus on decarbonizing the power sector, which is recognized as a key means in achieving environmental equity. The new administration is in the process of rejoining the Paris climate accord, has spoken in support of zero carbon power sources such as nuclear, and has spoken of increased public spending in support of the industry and related industries. The bipartisan infrastructure plan passed in 2021 specifically has spending elements in support of nuclear power and technology development.
 
In light of these emerging policies, there has been significant increase in the public awareness of the essential requirement that nuclear be a big part of the grid to achieve zero carbon goals. In an article early in 2020, Yale360.com, highlighted the potential of new generation Small Module Reactors (“SMRs”) in driving the achievement of a zero-carbon grid. Nuclear, especially SMRs, are recognized for their potential to replace carbon intensive power generation while maintaining a smaller footprint than existing coal plants. In February 2021, the Montana State Senate approved a feasibility study to evaluate replacing coal fired power generation with SMRs at the Colstrip power plant. Further, the benefits of SMRs are also noted as a key element to restore ecological systems while simultaneously maintaining zero carbon power generation. Idaho GOP Rep. Mike Simpson has proposed a sweeping $33.5 billion plan to save the Pacific Northwest’s iconic salmon that includes breaching four of the most controversial dams in the country. The power generation of the dams would be replaced by building SMRs as part of this plan. As 2021 unfolded, Canada, Poland, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania have all announced plans to pursue the build out of nuclear power generation, especially initial review of SMRs. Finally, Management feels that we are well positioned as one of the largest independent businesses focused on services supporting decarbonization through our support of the nuclear power industry to benefit from these developments in the economy and governing policy.

BUSINESS STRATEGY, INDUSTRY TRENDS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 
Business Strategy
 
Serve existing customers and adjacencies with compelling solutions, with a focus on decarbonization:
 
Our objective has been to create a leading business focused on decarbonizing the power industries by providing a diverse set of highly unique and essential services and technologies. We are now one of the leading, publicly traded engineering and technology companies serving the zero-carbon energy sector of nuclear power and adjacent nuclear markets in DOE, US Navy and related defense sectors. As a result of this effort and established leadership position in key sectors, we are positioned to expand into essential clean energy opportunities that may arise such as wind, solar, hydrogen production, and others. In 2022, we will keenly focus on organic growth in the sectors we serve by: cross selling and upselling in our existing markets as we focus on delivering significant value to our customers in a manner of excellence; create new and compelling solutions in-house as a result of advancing our technology offerings in sponsorship with industry early adopters focused on critical business need; develop  new services as a result of combining our expertise; expand into compelling adjacent markets such as clean energy as they may arise with renewed sales focus.
  Table of Contents
Cross sell and upsell into existing markets:
 
From 2015 through early 2019, we devoted considerable time and effort to diversify the Company’s solutions capabilities for the nuclear power sector via a rollup of essential services providers to the industry. To ensure efficient and streamlined operations for the business, we have brought all of the engineering services together into one organization with one leader; and the Workforce Solutions teams together as one team under one leader. The business units operate uniformly within their respective structure. As such, the opportunity to cross-sell the capabilities across the entire customer base is greatly enhanced. This further differentiates us as a unique provider to industry vs. providers of specific niche services. The unified go-to-market efforts, such as cross-selling capability should lead to greater share of available spending within the customer base, which in turn should lead to significant upselling opportunity. As a result of a rejuvenated marketing effort, we are equipped to take this new approach to market. In particular, with the US government rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement and driving to decarbonize the energy grid by 2035, and create a carbon neutral economy by 2050, decarbonization of the energy sector will require significant investment for decades to come. As a key provider of essential services to the power sector, with a focus on decarbonization, we are poised to benefit from and exploit this investment.
 
Organic growth through new and compelling technology:
 
While managing through the pandemic, in parallel, our leadership was investigating compelling opportunities by which we could utilize our capabilities to create significant value for the industry and advance the efforts of decarbonizing the power sector. As a result, we have identified a robust pipeline of new and compelling technology solutions to develop and take to market. Net new solutions, such as Data Validation and Reconciliation ("DVR") and Thermal System Monitoring ("TSM"), have created new revenue streams with the potential of on-going annuities through license revenue, software maintenance and services revenue. More on DVR and TSM below. GSE has announced a handful of new wins for these new solutions, which were created through our unique combination of our industry/engineering know-how and software development capabilities. As we have demonstrated in the past few years, small wins over time accrue into meaningful revenue on an on-going basis. This is a key element of our organic growth thesis: focusing on creating and bringing to market compelling technology solutions.

Industry Trends
 
Industry need to build and sustain a highly skilled workforce
 
We believe a critical ongoing challenge facing the industries we serve is access to, and continued development of, a highly trained and efficient workforce. This challenge manifests primarily in two ways: the increasing pace at which industry knowledge and experience are lost as a significant percentage of the existing experienced workforce reaches retirement age; and the fact that as new power plants come on-line, there is an increased demand for more workers to staff and operate those plants.
 
In the United States, the energy industry is expected to lose a large percentage of its workforce within the next few years as baby boomers retire on the traditional schedule. For example, Power Engineering reported that the power sector needs more than 100,000 skilled workers within the next few years to replace retiring baby boomers.  Electric, Light, and Power reported that 72% of energy employers currently struggle to find quality candidates and fill open positions. The National Electrical Contractors Association reported that 7,000 electricians join the field each year, while 10,000 retire. Finally, the Nuclear Energy Institute estimated that 39% of the nuclear workforce were eligible to retire in the next few years. As the nuclear industry continues to operate and modernizes its fleet and strains to maintain the high standards of training for the existing workforce, existing plant simulator systems, which provide a critical environment for training services, are often operating 24 hours a day. As workers retire and the need to backfill as well as expand the workforce for new units, certain operators are exploring the opportunity to de-bottleneck their existing simulator capabilities through the creation of dual reference simulators. Other workforce shortages and/or short-term spikes in demand for specialist skills that we offer similarly are positive developments for our business. Further, as new nuclear technologies are researched and developed, such as new reactors and new fuels, the R&D industry needs to identify the right talent to advance those endeavors.  Our business is uniquely positioned to identify and provide solutions that offer the best personnel for both short and long-term assignments.

Globally, as more people increase their standard of living, there is an expectation that their demand for power will increase, which in turn will require the on-going construction of power plants to meet this surging demand. The drive to lower carbon emissions from power generation while ensuring a stable baseload to accommodate intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar power brings focus on the essential nature of nuclear power. Developing a skilled labor force to operate these plants and keeping their skills current and their certifications in compliance with regulatory requirements is a key challenge facing the global power industry.
 
Status of decarbonization nuclear power in 2021/2022
 
According to World Energy Outlook report, 2019 had the second highest energy generation year for nuclear in history. By 2030, nuclear is planned to increase in generation capacity from roughly 400 GW to roughly 450 GW. Most new plants will be built in developing economies such as China and India, and advanced economies will invest to extend the lifetimes and increase the output of remaining nuclear reactors to bridge the gap to a new generation of reactors under development. With that said, several western countries have announced plans to develop nuclear power, including but not limited to the United States [at Idaho National Laboratory ("INL") via Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems’ (“UAMPS”)], Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania.
 
Decarbonizing the power sector is a key focus for advanced and developing nations. As a critical part of zero carbon clean energy, nuclear energy ensures access to abundant, clean, reliable and affordable energy to all who can connect to the grid, no matter a person’s background or status. To combat climate change and the pollution of the atmosphere, nuclear is a key element to decarbonizing the power sector across the world.  As more variable sources of power come on to the grid, such as wind and solar, ensuring a stable grid requires baseload, and nuclear is the essential source of economically scalable carbon free baseload. As such, nuclear, wind and solar are tied together in the massive effort to decarbonize economies the world over.
 
Nuclear provides 10% of the world’s power, and 20% of power for the United States.  President Biden is on record indicating a desire to decarbonize the United States power sector by 2035 and achieve a carbon neutral grid by 2050. The bipartisan infrastructure legislation passed into law in 2021 had specific allocation to enhance the nuclear power sector. To support this effort, the Department of Energy has made significant investment in the development of next generation zero carbon energy production through the development of advanced reactors and/or small modular reactors from Terra Power, X-Energy, NuScale and others.
 
These reactors are quickly becoming realty, with a January 2021 announcement of an agreement to facilitate the development of a project proposal for a NuScale-designed plant to be built at the United States Department of Energy (“DOE”) Idaho National Laboratory grounds.  Engineering, procurement and construction firm, Fluor, will provide its services for Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems’ (“UAMPS”) Carbon-Free Power Project. The project includes plans for nuclear energy featuring NuScale’s small modular reactor design. NuScale has been a long-time customer, using our simulation technology and engineering services to enhance their reactor design, operations and accelerate NRC licensing efforts.  In addition to the NuScale plans, HOLTEC, another firm with SMR technology, is studying the feasibility of building an SMR facility in New Jersey at the Oyster Creek site of a decommissioned traditional nuclear power plant. GE Hitachi Nuclear has also made a number of exciting announcements regarding their SMR technology being considered in Canada, Poland, potentially Clinch River in the United States, and elsewhere.
 
The SMR momentum is noted in the mainstream press. The Wall Street Journal notes the significant plans for SMRs being developed in the United States and elsewhere at an accelerated clip.  In addition to the plants currently planned, as mentioned earlier in this document, proponents of SMRs, see them as a complementary role in the smart grid of the future—replacing coal- and gas-fired plants and operating alongside wind and solar.
 
 All of this is part of a broader effort for decarbonization that we, through the aforementioned strategies, plan to exploit for organic growth.

Our engineering team, comprised of design, simulation, regulatory compliance, and performance optimization capabilities are unique to the industry and capable of addressing the entire power generation life cycle. As we move forward in alignment with client and industry goals targeting clean energy production and overall decarbonization we are positioned to be at the forefront in three critical areas:

• | optimization of existing generation assets
--+-------------------------------------------


• | design support and deployment of advanced reactor designs
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | integration with renewable power sources
--+-----------------------------------------

Optimizing Existing Generation Assets
    As the existing fleet of nuclear reactors age and competitive pressures increase, we find ever increasing significance in being able to provide value to their continued operation.  Maximizing power production through a variety of methods such as digital verification and reconciliation, a statistical based analysis used to lower uncertainty, and thus increase recognized power output is instrumental in helping these facilities face current competitive pressures.  Other approaches involving safe reduction of testing and inspection requirements or performance periodicities are also at the forefront of our cost saving techniques with defined services and products providing a clear and positive return on investment. In all cases, these efforts are aligned with keeping this important source of carbon free base power economically and technically viable.
Advanced Reactor Designs & Deployment
 
Designers of first-of-a-kind plants or existing plants need a highly accurate dynamic simulation platform to model a wide variety of design assumptions and concepts from control strategies to plant behavior to human factors. Because new builds and upgrades to existing plants result in deployment of new technology, often involving the integration of disparate technologies for the first time, a high-fidelity simulator enables designers to model the interaction between systems in advance of construction. With our combination of simulation technology and expert engineering, we were chosen to build first-of-a-kind simulators for the AP1000, PBMR, and small modular reactors such as those being built by NuScale.  Going forward, we also envision many of the optimization techniques and strategies currently emphasized for the existing reactor fleet incorporated with new-build prototypes as they begin to add value and assume a larger component of our clean, carbon free, power requirements.
Renewable Integration 
 
A significant component of overall decarbonization regarding power generation will ultimately fall to renewable sources such as wind, solar, and hydro generation. These technologies are individually well on their way towards assuming a significant share of the overall generation make-up and are expected to significantly increase. One of the particular needs is the ability to safely and efficiently integrate these renewable sources with our existing and planned nuclear generation. We are on the cutting edge, working closely with academia and industry support organizations to design, model, and evaluate creative approaches to support this integration. Base load production, renewable availability, and other pertinent factors are at the core of the solutions we are exploring.
Engineering Solutions for Decarbonization
 
With overall decarbonization as our primary focus, we will blend our current and future efforts in those areas described above to best support that goal positioning our Engineering team as recognized leaders in the pursuit of Clean Energy. An overview highlighting many areas of our current and planned involvement as well as the associated benefits is summarized below:
    With nuclear power being such a high percentage of carbon free power generation, the continued safe and efficient operation of these plants is critical to meeting decarbonization goals. We help the industry achieve these goals through better training and provide engineering services to optimize performance while maintaining regulatory compliance. Our focus is on products and services to improve the efficiency and lower operating costs for existing power generation assets as well as help the next generation of carbon free power plants achieve design approval and plant startup as quickly as possible.

Training plant operators and engineers is critical to safe operations and continued viability of the industry. Using state-of-the-art modeling tools combined with our leading nuclear power modeling expertise, we provide simulation solutions that achieve unparalleled fidelity and accuracy. We have also adapted these solutions to provide highly accurate training across a variety of delivery platforms. These include universal or generic simulators which are excellent in teaching fundamental concepts, systems, and plant behaviors. They are also used by academia for research on improved plant operations, human factors design and the development of automated procedures and decision support systems for the next generation of reactors. Our part task simulators and virtual control panels are cost effective solutions enabling customers broader freedom in where they deliver simulation training and opening the door for plant engineers and maintenance staff to access high fidelity training without interrupting the operator training program. Our full scope simulators use the most sophisticated modeling technology. For these reasons, we have delivered more nuclear power plant simulators than any other company in the world.
    Even prior to the COVID pandemic, we had delivered training products though the cloud. This delivery method reduces our customers infrastructure and ownership costs and provides anytime, anywhere access to rich learning content. Innovative Critical Thinking Exercises enable autonomous simulation training to take place, reducing the burden on instructors and increasing training touch time for students and employees. All of which enable the training organization to be more flexible and efficient.
    Our simulation solutions not only address industry training needs, but are used for simulation assisted engineering, the process of using simulation to virtually test and commission plant designs prior to construction.  Because new builds and upgrades to existing plants result in deployment of new technology, our high-fidelity simulator enables designers to model the interaction between systems in advance of construction. With our combination of simulation technology and expert engineering, we were chosen to build first-of-a-kind simulators for the AP1000, PBMR, and small modular reactors such as those being built by NuScale. This technique reduces design costs, accelerates design approvals, de-risks projects, and provides clients with a tool to sell their new plant designs to both customers and regulators.  In essence, enabling our customers to get to market faster.
    Beyond training, our technology is used to improve the efficiency of existing power generation assets. Our TSM System provide live insights into plant operations, by monitoring performance of key plant equipment, analyzes degradation and advises actions to be taken. When combined with DVR techniques, we can help reduce operating and maintenance cost. DVR enhances the quality of data for analysis and decision making, providing a solution to better detect and identify faulty measurements/sensors and thus reduce maintenance costs by focusing on critical components.

    We see organic growth through closer integration of these engineering activities and technologies to provide solutions to improve the performance of our customers’ people and plants.
 
Workforce Solutions
 


  Table of Contents
As our customers’ experienced employees retire or pursue other opportunities, access to industry experts to operate and train existing and new employees how to operate nuclear plants is essential to ensure safe, ongoing plant operation. In addition, operating and training needs change over time and sometimes our clients require fixed-price, discrete projects, new or updated methods, or specialized courses in contrast to straight staff augmentation. The industry needs operating personnel, including procedure writers, engineers, operators and instructors who can step in and use, as well as, update the client’s operating methods, procedures, training material and more. Finding technical professionals and instructors, who know the subject, can perform the work or teach it to others and can adapt to the client’s culture is critical. We provide qualified professionals, instructors and turnkey projects/courses that work within the client’s system and complement the operating or training methods they already have in place. Examples of our training program courses include senior reactor operator (“SRO”) certification, generic fundamentals training, and simulation supervisor training. We also provide expert support through workforce solutions, consulting, or turnkey projects for procedure writing, technical engineers, project managers, training material upgrade and development, outage execution, planning and scheduling, corrective actions programs, and equipment reliability. Our Workforce Solutions segment include traditional staffing services, such as temporary and direct hire, as well as customized approaches in which we work with our customers to evaluate their specific needs and put together a strategic plan specifically to meet their unique needs. Workforce solutions is not only a complement to our other service offerings; it often leads the way as the preferred method for many of our clients to execute entire projects and/or supplement their own staff during project peak periods or with specialized skill sets that are often hard to find.  Our staffing experts give our customers the ability to ramp up quickly, eliminate risks, and provide more flexible options as situations often demand.
    In addition to the core training and staffing business lines in the nuclear sector, we continue to see significant organic growth opportunity with our Workforce Solutions segment by expanding our service offerings to meet the evolving needs of the energy industry as well as other opportunities that support decarbonization and major infrastructure projects.

COMPETITION
 
In the nuclear simulation market, we compete directly with firms primarily from Canada, France and the U.S., such as L-3 MAPPS Inc., a subsidiary of Harris (Canada), CORYS T.E.S.S (France) and Western Services Corporation. In the fossil simulation market, we compete with smaller companies in the U.S. and overseas. In the process industry, our main competition comes from large digital control system/automation companies such as Honeywell and Schneider. In our engineering market, we compete with firms primarily from North America such as Enercon Services, Kinectrics, Sargent & Lundy, and AECOM.
 
The Workforce Solutions business services include technical professional and training-related and services as well as staff augmentation solutions. The competition for these services includes but is not limited to the following: GP Strategies (acquired by LTG in 2021), The Westwind Group, Professional Training Technologies, and Western Technical Services. The competition for staff augmentation includes: System One, Aerotek, and Peak Technical. Competition with staff augmentation is further impacted by wide scale industry consolidation as a result of the growing movement toward use of Managed Staffing Providers (MSPs).  As some competitors, have been forced to close their doors, others have lost market share with the MSP model as it has shown a clearer picture of which companies can best deliver. By conducting in depth reviews and ensuring strategic alignment with MSP providers, Workforce Solutions has continuously found success with the MSP models and avoided the missteps that have impacted other competitors.
 
Competitive Advantages
 
Although there is competition in various industry niches, few companies in our space compare to our engineering, simulation and performance optimization expertise, especially for the nuclear power industry. Few of our competitors serve the broader performance improvement market and few work across the full spectrum of energy markets addressing clean energy sources and decarbonization initiatives, specifically, existing nuclear generation, advanced reactor applications, and ongoing integration with renewable power sources.  Our unique combination of talent and expertise, built through organic and acquisition-based growth has positioned us perfectly to align with the clean energy initiatives of our clients and the industry at large.
 
Full Spectrum Support. Over the past several years we have assembled a unique and highly experienced group of talent through organic growth and strategic acquisition.  Our Engineering team comprised of design, simulation, regulatory compliance, and performance optimization capabilities are unique to the industry and capable of addressing the entire power generation life cycle. A major and ongoing attribute associated with this unique grouping of expertise is our multi-tiered approach aimed at leveraging the aggregate strengths and abilities of our resource components towards maximizing client and shareholder value. This centers on the following key areas:
 


  Table of Contents

• | Retain and strengthen our “Base” revenue through optimization of current capabilities and established client relationships. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Integrate our product and service areas to provide more comprehensive or enhanced solutions when internal or external value can be identified.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Explore, evaluate, and develop new collaborative service areas, products, and solutions closely aligned with internal core strengths, client goals, and overall industry clean power initiatives.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Base Revenue and Strategic Integration. We will continue to build upon what has historically worked well for our Engineering Service Areas maintaining our client connections through efforts that provide a clear and immediate return such as optimized power generation and efforts that reduce or extend testing and inspection requirements.  In parallel we are aggressively evaluating ways to integrate and package our design, simulation, and plant performance components to further enhance client benefit.  In many cases this is structured with our historical base scope of supply proposed as the stand-alone foundation with optional scopes included to deliver a more integrated comprehensive solution if desired.
 
New Product / Service Areas. A dedicated, strategically focused exercise centered on evaluation of core capabilities, potential adjacencies, client needs, and industry direction has resulted in several new product or service initiatives within our Engineering group.  Further development, expansion, and application of existing product lines and associated services have moved to the forefront of this effort with the added benefit of minimizing engineering and information technology level of effort while maintaining very high client benefit. Additional competitive advantage are also present through client contracts which help fund the R&D components of the initiatives.
 
Proprietary Software Tools. We developed a library of proprietary software tools including auto-code generators and first principles-based system models that substantially improve and expedite the design, production and integration, testing and modification of software and systems. These tools are used to automatically generate the computer code and systems models required for specific functions commonly used in simulation applications, thereby enabling us or our customers to develop repeatable high-fidelity, real-time software quickly, accurately and at lower costs. We also have an expertise integrating third-party engineering codes into our simulation environment, thereby offering some of the most sophisticated technical solutions in the market. We have a substantial library of process-specific simulation models and e-learning modules aimed at the oil and gas, refining and specialty chemicals markets. Lastly, our TSM platform is being used as a plant performance reporting tool and as the graphical user interface for our DVR service initiatives which provide high value client return through power recovery and other optimization strategies.  This platform also serves as the foundation for our new product service initiatives with numerous optional modules and applications under consideration.
 
Performance Expertise. We are a leading innovator and developer of engineering directed solutions for the power generation industry. Our design, simulation, and plant performance resources are fully engaged with industry developments and client requirements routinely providing answers to our clients most pressing needs. Design modifications addressing base generation usage for nuclear facilities, optimization of power production through innovative statistical analysis, and real-time simulation software producing high-fidelity, real-time plant simulation are representative examples. As of December 31, 2021, we employed a highly educated and experienced multinational workforce of approximately 308 employees, including approximately 135 engineers and scientists in fields such as nuclear, chemical, mechanical and electrical engineering, applied mathematics and computer sciences, and approximately 112 instructors and plant operations staff specialists.
 
Unique Combination of Talent. Few in our market space bring together the sophistication of simulation technology with the engineering expertise, training expertise and plant performance expertise to provide the holistic people and plant performance improvement solutions as well as we do.
 
Reputation for Customer Satisfaction. As part of its ISO-9001:2015 Quality Program Certification, we measure customer satisfaction across numerous factors such as On-Time Delivery, Problem Solving, and Customer Communication. In each category measured, we routinely exceed customer expectations.
 
Training Curricula
 
We have developed hundreds of detailed courses and simulator exercise material and specific industrial applications including oil and gas refining, gas-oil production, nuclear and combined cycle gas turbine power plant and desalination.
 
Our Workforce Solutions business is mostly focused on training and operations support. Our trainers and consultants provide their services at customer facilities which allows us to interface with our customers directly in the course of doing business versus only periodically calling on customers. Our proximity gives us a significant competitive advantage in that we can immediately offer and implement solutions rather than contending with lengthy bid processes.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We depend upon our intellectual property rights in our proprietary technologies and our distinctive trade and service marks. We maintain a portfolio of: trademarks and servicemarks (both registered and unregistered) on our logos, product and service names, and other elements of trade dress; copyrights (both registered and unregistered) on written materials including software code, manuals, and other creative works; trade secret protections on its proprietary technologies and methodologies; and licenses from third parties to use and commercially exploit other protected intellectual property. While such trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and inbound licenses as a group are of material importance to us, we do not consider any one trademark, copyright, trade secret, or license to be of such importance that the loss or expiration thereof would materially affect us. We distribute our software products under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive and nontransferable licenses for the use of the products. Usage of our licensed on-premise software is restricted to designated computers at specified sites, unless the customer obtains a site-wide license for its use of the software. Our software products delivered as a service (SaaS) over the internet also contain customer verifications and usage limitations. We employ not only software and hardware security measures to prevent unauthorized use of its software, but also detailed contractual terms and limitations within our license and service agreements to prohibit unauthorized usage or reproduction. We offer our customers both perpetual software licenses with unlimited duration (as long as the customer complies with the license terms) and term-limited software licenses and usage agreements.
 
We do not own any patents. We believe that all of our trademarks are valid and will have an unlimited duration as long as they are adequately protected and sufficiently used. We have numerous registered U.S. trademarks, including: GSE Systems®, JTOPMERET®, RELAP5-HD®, TOTALVISION®, VPanel® and SimExec®. We believe that our international trademark protection is adequate to our business needs. We also claim trademark rights to DesignEP™, Java Application and Development Environment (JADE)™, OpenSim™, PSA-HD™, RACS™, SimSuite Pro™, SmartTutor™, THOR™, and Xtreme I/S™. Despite these protections, we cannot be sure that we have protected or will be able to protect our intellectual property adequately, that the unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property will be prevented, that others have not or will not develop similar technology independently, or, to the extent we own any patents in the future, that others have not or will not be able to design around those patents. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries in which our products are sold do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
 
Our operations are directly and indirectly affected by political developments and both domestic and foreign governmental regulations. We cannot determine the extent to which changing political priorities, new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations may affect our future operations, positively or negatively.

  Table of Contents
 BACKLOG
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $41.3 million of total gross revenue in backlog compared to $40.4 million as of December 31, 2020.  Most of our contract terms are for less than 24 months. Our backlog includes only those amounts that have been funded and authorized and does not reflect the full amounts we may receive over the term of such contracts. Our backlog includes future expected revenue at contract rates, excluding contract renewals or extensions that are at the discretion of the client. We calculate backlog without regard to possible project reductions or expansions or potential cancellations unless and until we have reason to believe that such changes may occur.
 
Backlog is expressed in terms of gross revenue and, therefore, may include significant estimated amounts of third-party or pass-through costs to subcontractors and other parties.  Because backlog is not a defined accounting term, our computation of backlog may not necessarily be comparable to that of our industry peers.
 
HUMAN CAPITAL
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 308 employees, which include 187 in our Performance Improvement segment and 121 in our Workforce Solutions segment. The 308 employees are comprised of 241  fulltime employees and 67 part time employees, Excluding our Workforce Solutions segment, which consists primarily of specialized instructors, our employee attrition rate for 2021 among all staff was approximately 7.5%. To date, we have been able to locate and engage highly qualified employees as needed and we expect our growth efforts to be addressed through attracting top talent.
 
Our people are what make us who we are today. Not only does it depend on employing highly skilled professionals but also people who can work together, effectively and collaboratively, as a team, whether departmental, cross functional, or cross company. Our employees come from diverse backgrounds as well as a diverse geography, and we look to attract people by offering a positive and welcoming work environment, strong management and leadership teams, along with a competitive compensation and benefit package.
 
Talent Management
 
We are committed to recruiting, hiring, retaining, and developing the most talented and skilled professionals & graduates available in the job market. Our approach to talent management includes a rigorous selection process followed by coaching, training, and knowledge transfer. We differentiate our program from typical performance management programs by focusing on the manager’s role. HR provides support but the day-to-day interactions that ensure the employee’s success come from the manager. They coach and develop employees through their active and regular interactions. This is a critical part of both current performance as well as knowledge transfer from our more experienced staff that may be nearing the end of their career, to our less experienced. Training takes place internally and across our companies to take advantage of our SMEs in our industry. As a result of this we can integrate different talent pools to be interchangeable across projects. In addition, we offer a tuition reimbursement that allows employees to further their education or attend external professional development programs.
 
In 2022, we will be putting career paths in place and compensation structures that will increase our retention rates as well as offering leadership development for our upcoming, emerging leaders that will lead us into the future.
 
Compensation & Benefits
 
We offer market competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to competitive base wages, additional benefits provided include: a Long-Term Incentive Stock Option Plan, a Company matched 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and employee assistance programs.
Diversity & Inclusion
 
A diverse and inclusive workforce adds value to our Company and helps us succeed. We believe diversity is important because it provides varied insight and varied perspectives which results in innovative thinking, better decision making and faster problem solving. Having a diverse workforce also brings different skill sets and experiences that are shared throughout the Company. Our culture, which is collaborative in nature, provides for inclusion of all employees in all aspects of our work.
Health, Safety, & COVID-19
 


  Table of Contents
The health and safety of our employees is of paramount importance to us. Our OSHA records show that we have had zero injuries/illnesses in the past four years, and we attribute that to our employees working carefully so they don’t get injured. We provide everyone a safety manual and the employees that work at power plants are also provided with the necessary safety training on site.
 
In response to COVID-19, we have implemented some protocols to keep our employees safe. All employees are provided remote work with office visits restricted to essential work only and includes use of masks, social distancing, and proper hand washing and cleaning protocols. Travel has also been limited to essential work only. While some employees are doing essential work at client sites, all our clients have provided their COVID safety protocols, and they are strictly adhered to.
 
During COVID-19, our employees have faced the challenges of maintaining their mental health as well as providing an environment for their children to participate in virtual learning. In response to this, we have provided multiple mental health resources for our employees and their families including subscriptions to Headspace as well as a wellness program that incentivizes and motivates people to eat healthy, get some form of exercise, and destress. We also offer an Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”) and full access to mental health providers through our health partner, Cigna. And in order for our employees to be able to assist in the virtual learning environment with their children, we have offered flexible work schedules to accommodate their needs.
 
COVID-19
 
Our employees began working remotely during the first quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to do so when practical and as mandated by local, state and federal directives and regulations. Employees almost entirely work from home within our Performance Improvement Solutions segment, except when required to be at the client site for essential project work. Our performance contracts, which are considered an essential service, are permitted to and mostly continue without pause; however, we have experienced certain delays in new business. For our staff augmentation business, we have seen certain contracts for our Workforce Solutions customers pause, delay, and/or reduce scope as clients faced their own challenges associated with shrinking their on-premise workforces to the minimum operating levels in response to the pandemic; as a result, our Workforce Solutions segment has experienced a decline in its billable employee base since the start of the pandemic. We cannot fully estimate the length or gravity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have experienced delays in commencing some projects, as a result, our ability to recognize revenue has been delayed for some contracts. We routinely monitor our operating expenses as a result of contract delays and have made adjustments to keep our gross profit at a sustainable level.

 GSE SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 December 31, 2021 and 2020
 
   1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
   Principles of consolidation   
 GSE Systems, Inc. is a leading provider of professional and technical engineering, staffing services, and simulation software to clients in the power and process industries. References in this report to “GSE,” the “Company,” “we” and “our” are to GSE Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries, collectively. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   
  Accounting estimates   
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including, but not limited to those related to revenue recognition on long-term contracts, allowance for doubtful accounts, product warranties, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets acquired, impairment of long-lived assets to be disposed of, valuation of stock-based compensation awards and the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates.   
  Business combinations   Business combinations are accounted for in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 805, Business Combinations, using the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to us. Any excess purchase price is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred.   Revenues and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations commencing on the date of acquisition.   Acquisitions may include contingent consideration payments based on future financial measures of an acquired company. Under ASC 805, contingent consideration is required to be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. We estimate the fair value of these liabilities based on financial projections of the acquired companies and estimated probabilities of achievement. At each reporting date, the contingent consideration obligation is revalued to estimated fair value, and changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition are reflected in income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations, and could cause a material impact to our operating results. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods and rates, changes in the timing and amount of revenue and/or earnings estimates, and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various earn-out criteria.   
  Revenue recognition   
 We derive our revenue through three broad revenue streams: 1) System Design and Build (“SDB”), 2) software, and 3) training and consulting services. We recognize revenue from SDB and software contracts mainly through the Performance Improvement Solutions segment and the training and consulting service contracts through both the Performance Improvement Solutions segment and Workforce Solutions segment.   
 The SDB contracts are typically fixed-price and consist of initial design, engineering, assembly and installation of training simulators which include hardware, software, labor, and PCS on the software. We generally have two main performance obligations for an SDB contract: (1) the training simulator build and (2) the PCS period. The training simulator build performance obligation generally includes hardware, software, and labor. The transaction price under the SDB contracts is allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. We recognize the training simulator build revenue over the construction and installation period using the cost-to-cost input method. In applying the cost-to-cost input method, we use the actual costs incurred to date relative to the total estimated costs to measure the work progress toward the completion of the performance obligation and recognize revenue over time as control transfers to a customer. Estimated contract costs are reviewed and revised periodically during the contract period, and the cumulative effect of any change in estimates is recognized in the period in which the change is identified. Estimated losses are recognized in the period such losses become known.
   


  Table of Contents
 Uncertainties inherent in the performance of contracts include labor availability and productivity, material costs, change order scope and pricing, software modification and customer acceptance issues. The reliability of these cost estimates is critical to our revenue recognition as a significant change in the estimates can cause our revenue and related margins to change significantly from previous estimates.
   
 Management judgments and estimates involved in the initial creation and subsequent updates to our estimates-at-completion and related profit recognized are critical for our revenue recognition associated with SDB contracts. Inputs and assumptions requiring significant management judgment included anticipated direct labor, subcontract labor, and other direct costs required to deliver on unfinished performance obligations.   
 The SDB contracts generally provide a one-year base warranty on the systems. The base warranty will not be accounted for as a separate performance obligation under the contract because it does not provide the customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the completed project complies with agreed-upon specifications. Warranties extended beyond our typical one-year period will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine if it provides more than just assurance that the product operates as intended, which requires carve-out as a separate performance obligation.   
  Revenue from the sale of perpetual standalone and term software licenses, which do not require significant modification or customization, is recognized upon its delivery to the customer.  Revenue from the sale of cloud-based, subscription-based software licenses is recognized ratably over the term of such licenses following delivery to the customer. Delivery is considered to have occurred when the customer receives a copy of the software and is able to use and benefit from the software.   
 
      A software license sale contract with multiple deliverables typically includes the following elements: license, installation and training services, and PCS. The total transaction price of a software license sale contract is typically fixed and is allocated to the identified performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. Revenue is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. Specifically, license revenue is recognized when the software license is delivered to the customer; installation and training revenue are recognized when the installation and training are completed without regard to a detailed evaluation of the point in time criteria due to the short-term nature of the installation and training services (one to two days on average); and PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, as PCS is deemed as a stand-ready obligation.   
 The contracts within the training and consulting services revenue stream are either T&M based or fixed-price based. Under a typical T&M contract, we are compensated based on the number of hours of approved time provided by temporary workers and the bill rates which are fixed by type of work, as well as approved expenses incurred. The customers are billed on a regular basis, such as weekly, biweekly or monthly. In accordance with ASC 606-10-55-18, Revenue from contracts with customers, we elected to apply the “right to invoice” practical expedient, under which we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have the right to invoice. The invoice amount represents the number of hours of approved time worked by each temporary worker multiplied by the bill rate for the type of work, as well as approved expenses incurred. Under a typical fixed-price contract, we recognize the revenue on a Percentage of Completion basis as it relates to construction contracts with revenue recognized based on project delivery over time. Revenue from the sale of short-term contracts with a delivery period of one month or less is recognized in the month completed.   
 For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.   
 The transaction price for software contracts is generally fixed, and we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software, with fees due in advance or shortly after delivery of the software.   


  Table of Contents
 We recognize training and consulting services revenue as services are performed and bill our customers for services that we have provided on a regular basis (i.e. weekly, biweekly or monthly).   
 Contract asset relates to performance under the contract for obligations that are satisfied but not yet billed, which we classify as contract receivables, net.   
 Contract liability, which we classify as billing-in-excess of revenue earned, relates to payments received in advance of performance under the contract. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as performance obligations are satisfied.   
  Cash and cash equivalents   
 Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and highly liquid investments including money market accounts with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.   
  Contract receivables, net and contract asset and liabilities   
 Contract receivables include recoverable costs and accrued profit not billed which represents revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed. Contract asset (contract receivables, net) include amounts earned in performance of services that have not been invoiced. Contract liabilities include billings in excess of revenue earned on uncompleted contracts in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets represent advanced billings to clients on contracts in advance of work performed. Generally, such amounts will be earned and recognized over the next twelve months.   Billed receivables are recorded at invoiced amounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical trends of past due accounts, write-offs, specific identification and review of customer accounts.   
  Impairment of long-lived assets   
 Long-lived assets, such as equipment, purchased software, capitalized software development costs, and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized at the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheets and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated.   
  Development expenditures   
 Development expenditures incurred to meet customer specifications under contracts are charged to cost of revenue. Company sponsored development expenditures are either charged to operations as incurred and are included in research and development expenses or are capitalized as software development costs. The amounts incurred for Company sponsored development activities relating to the development of new products and services or the improvement of existing products and services, were approximately $0.9 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of these amounts, the Company capitalized approximately $0.3 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.   
  Equipment, software and leasehold improvements, net   
 Equipment and purchased software are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method with estimated useful lives ranging from three years to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the lease or the estimated useful life, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method. Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related depreciation are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operations. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.   
 

  Table of Contents
 Software development costs   
 Certain computer software development costs, including direct labor cost, are capitalized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Capitalization of computer software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility. Capitalization ceases and amortization of capitalized costs begins when the software product is commercially available for general release to customers. Amortization of capitalized computer software development costs is included in cost of revenue and is determined using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, typically three years. On an annual basis, or more frequently as conditions indicate, we assess the recovery of the unamortized software development costs by estimating the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the sale of the product. If the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the unamortized software cost we will write-down the carrying amount of such asset to its estimated fair value based on the future discounted cash flows. The excess of any unamortized computer software costs over the related fair value is written down and charged to operations. Included in capitalized software development costs are certain expenses associated with the development software as a service. Significant changes in the sales projections could result in an impairment with respect to the capitalized software that is reported on our consolidated balance sheets.
   
  Goodwill and intangible assets   
 Our intangible assets include amounts recognized in connection with business acquisitions, including customer relationships, trade names, non-compete agreements and alliance agreements. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, definite-lived intangible assets were reviewed for impairment in the first quarter of 2020. The undiscounted cash flows evidenced impairment for the DP Engineering asset group as such, we used a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the DP Engineering asset group and recorded an impairment charge of $4.3 million as of the period ended March 31, 2020.   
 Our intangible assets impairment analysis includes the use of undiscounted and discounted cash flow models that requires management to make assumptions regarding estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows.   
 Intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset, except for contract backlog and contractual customer relations, which are recognized in proportion to the related project revenue streams. Intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. We do not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.   
 Goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired. We review goodwill for impairment annually as of December 31 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment, as defined by U.S. GAAP. We have determined that we have two reporting units, which are the same as our two operating segments: (i) Performance Improvement Solutions (“Performance”) and (ii) Workforce Solutions.
   
 ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform impairment testing. Under ASU 2011-08, an entity is not required to perform step one of the goodwill impairment test for a reporting unit if it is more likely than not that its fair value is greater than its carrying amount. Additionally, ASU 2017-04 permits eliminating two step approach when there is indication of impairment.
   
 During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, We determined that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations was an indicator of a triggering event that could result in potential impairment of goodwill. As such we performed a Step 1 goodwill analysis whereby we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its respective carrying value. Based upon this analysis, we determined the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value and thus there was no impairment as of the period ended March 31, 2020. We completed our annual quantitative step 1 analysis as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and concluded that the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values.   
 Our goodwill impairment analysis includes the use of a discounted cash flow model that requires management to make assumptions regarding estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, and risk-adjusted discount rates. We make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.   
 

  Table of Contents
 Foreign currency translation   
 The United States Dollar (USD) is our functional currency and that of our subsidiaries operating in the United States. The functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the economic environment in which the subsidiary primarily does business. Our foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements are translated into USD using the exchange rates applicable to the dates of the financial statements. Assets and liabilities are translated into USD using the period-end spot foreign exchange rates. Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. Equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates. The effects of these translation adjustments are cumulative translation adjustments, which are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity.   For any business transaction that is in a currency different from the entity’s functional currency, we record a gain or loss based on the difference between the exchange rate at the transaction date and the exchange rate at the transaction settlement date (or rate at period end, if unsettled) to the foreign currency realized gain (loss) account in the consolidated statements of operations.   
  Income taxes   
 Income taxes are provided under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. A provision is made for our current liability for federal, state and foreign income taxes and the change in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities.   
 We establish accruals for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return when it is not more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities that have full knowledge of all relevant information. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Favorable or unfavorable adjustment of the accrual for any particular issue would be recognized as an increase or decrease to income tax expense in the period of a change in facts and circumstances. Interest and penalties related to income taxes are accounted for as income tax expense.   
  Stock-based compensation   
 Stock-based compensation expense is based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Compensation expense related to stock-based awards is recognized on a pro rata straight-line basis based on the fair value of share awards that are scheduled to vest during the requisite service period.   
  Significant customers and concentration of credit risk   
  For the year ended December 31, 2021, we have a concentration of revenue from one individual customer, which accounted for 13.8% of our consolidated revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we have a concentration of revenue from one individual customer, which accounted for 14.1% of our consolidated revenue. No other individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in 2021 or 2020.   As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we have no customer that accounted over 10% of the Company’s consolidated contract receivables.   
  Fair values of financial instruments   
 The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value due to their short term duration.   
 

  Table of Contents
 Derivative instruments   
 Occasionally, we utilize forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage market risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to use such derivative financial instruments to protect against market risk arising in the normal course of business in order to reduce the impact of these exposures. We minimize credit exposure by limiting counterparties to nationally recognized financial institutions. We do not have such derivative instruments as of December 31, 2021.   
  COVID-19   
  Our employees began working remotely during the first quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to do so when practical and as mandated by local, state and federal directives and regulations. Employees almost entirely work from home within our Performance Improvement Solutions segment, except when required to be at the client site for essential project work. Our Performance contracts, which are considered an essential service, are permitted to and mostly continue without pause; however, we have experienced certain delays in new business. For our staff augmentation business, we have seen certain contracts for our Workforce Solutions customers paused or delayed as clients shrink their own on-premise workforces to the minimum operating levels in response to the pandemic; as a result, our Workforce Solutions segment has experienced a decline in its billable employee base since the start of the pandemic. Although we cannot fully estimate the length or gravity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our business at this time, we have experienced delays in commencing new projects and thus our ability to recognize revenue has been delayed for some contracts. We have also experienced order reductions or other negative changes to orders due to the pandemic. We routinely monitor our operating expenses as a result of contract delays and have made adjustments to keep our gross profit at a sustainable level.       
 2.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
   Accounting pronouncements recently adopted   
 
 In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, Investments – Equity Securities, Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures, and Derivatives and Hedging, which provides clarity for companies that hold equity securities at cost to first update the fair value of an investment, immediately prior to applying the Equity Method of Accounting; or clarity for companies that enter into forward contracts to purchase additional shares of an equity security that would then require the investee to account for the investment via the Equity Method. This ASU is applicable for public companies starting with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted ASU 2020-01 on January 1, 2021. This standard did not have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements since we do not currently hold any investments at cost.
   
 In September 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-10, Codification Improvements, which is part of an ongoing attempt to improve the consistency of the codification. Previously the option to disclose information in the notes to the financial statements was in one of two sections: Disclosure Section (Section 50) or Other Presentation Matters (Section 45). ASU 2020-10 conforms the disclosure requirements into Section 50 and provides additional information on specific guidance that was previously unclear or not included in the codification. This ASU is applicable for public companies starting with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption available for interim and annual financial statements not already filed and using the retrospective approach. However, the FASB does not believe that this should change any of the current reporting or disclosure requirements. We adopted ASU 2020-10 on January 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.    
  Accounting pronouncements not yet adopted   
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which introduces new guidance for credit losses on instruments within its scope. The new guidance introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including, but not limited to, trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and net investments in leases. The new guidance also modifies the impairment model for availablefor- debt securities and requires the entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on an available-for-sale debt security is a credit loss. The standard also indicates that entities may not use the length of time a security has been in an unrealized loss position as a factor in concluding whether a credit loss exists. Early adoption is permitted for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. On October 16, 2019, the FASB voted to defer the deadlines for private companies and certain small public companies, including smaller reporting companies, to implement the new accounting standards on credit losses. The new effective date is January 1, 2023. As a smaller reporting company, we have elected to defer adoption in line with new deadlines and are currently evaluating the effects, if any, that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   
 Management has evaluated other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  


   3.  Earnings per share   
 Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of outstanding common shares for the period.  Diluted earnings per share adjusts the weighted average shares outstanding for the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding vested stock options were exercised. Basic and diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of outstanding shares for the period.   
  The number of common shares and common share equivalents used in the determination of basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share were as follows:

   4.  Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act    
 Paycheck Protection Program Loan (PPP Loan)   
 On March 27, 2020, the United States enacted the CARES Act. to extend liquidity to small businesses and assist in retaining employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. We applied for and, on April 23, 2020, received a payroll protection program loan in the amount of $10.0 million (the “PPP Loan”) under the CARES Act, as administered by the SBA. The application for receipt of the PPP Loan required us to certify, in good faith, that the attendant economic uncertainty made the loan necessary to support our ongoing operations. The PPP Loan bore interest at a rate of 1% per annum and would mature on April 23, 2022, with the first payment deferred until September 2021. We used the proceeds of the PPP Loan for payroll and related costs, rent and utilities. Pursuant to the regulations promulgated by the SBA, in order to request forgiveness of the PPP Loan, we were required to submit an application to the Lender substantiating that we were entitled to the PPP Loan and used the proceeds of the PPP Loan as permitted under the CARES Act. The Lender reviewed our application for forgiveness and associated documentation, and on February 26, 2021 forwarded our application to the SBA with the Lender’s determination that the loan is fully forgivable. On August 5, 2021, we received notice that full principal amount and all accrued interest thereon of the PPP Loan was formally forgiven by the SBA. We recognized other income of $10.1 million related to this forgiveness during 2021.     Table of Contents
 Employee Retention Credits (ERC)   
 Employee retention tax credits, made available under the CARES Act, allow eligible employers to claim a refundable tax credit against the employer share of Social Security tax equal to 70% of the qualified wages they pay to employees, initially from March 27, 2020 until June 30, 2021, and extended through September 30, 2021. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we have received a refund of $0.2 million from the IRS for previously filed Form 941s. For the year ended December 31, 2021 we have applied for a total of $5.0 million from the IRS with the timely filing of Form 941 and 941-X and recognized a benefit of $2.2 million from unremitted payroll taxes as allowable. We recorded other income of $7.2 million related to the employee retention tax credits earned for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we received employee retention tax credit refunds totaling $0.9 million with remaining outstanding refunds receivable of $4.1 million which was included in the other current assets balance at December 31, 2021. Subsequent to the year end, we received the employee retention tax credit refunds of $1.1 million.      5.  Revenue   
  We account for revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We primarily generate revenue through three distinct revenue streams: (1) SDB, (2) software and (3) training and consulting services across our Performance and Workforce Solutions segments. We recognize revenue from SDB and software contracts mainly through our Performance segment. We recognize training and consulting service contracts through Performance Improvement Solutions segment and Workforce Solutions segment.          The following table represents a disaggregation of revenue by type of goods or services for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, along with the reportable segment for each category:   (in thousands)

 For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized revenue of $26 thousand related to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods.   
 As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations of SDB, software and fixed-price training and consulting services contracts is $21.2 million. We will recognize the revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied, which is expected to occur over the next twelve months.   Part of the training and consulting services contracts are T&M based. Under a typical T&M contract, we are compensated based on the number of hours of approved time provided by temporary workers and the bill rates, which are fixed by type of work, as well as approved expenses incurred. As part of our adoption of ASU 2014-09, we have elected to use the optional exemption under ASC 606-10-50-14(b) Revenue from contracts with customers, pursuant to which we have excluded disclosures of transaction prices allocated to remaining performance obligations under such contracts and when we expect to recognize the revenue.  
   6.  Restructuring expenses   
  International Restructuring
   On December 27, 2017, the Board of Directors approved an international restructuring plan to streamline and optimize our global operations. Beginning in December 2017, we have been in the process of consolidating its engineering services and R&D activities to Maryland and ceasing an unprofitable non-core business in the United Kingdom (UK). As a result, we have closed our offices in Nyköping, Sweden; Chennai, India; and Stockton-on-Tees, UK. These actions are designed to improve our productivity by eliminating duplicate employee functions, increasing our focus on our core business, improving efficiency and maintaining the full range of engineering capabilities while reducing costs and organizational complexity.   
 We eliminated approximately 40 positions due to these changes, primarily in Europe and India, and has undertaken other related cost-savings measures. As a result of these efforts, we have recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $3.9 million, primarily related to workforce reductions, contracts termination costs and asset write-offs due to the exit activities. We recorded a restructuring charge of $1.0 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. In addition to the restructuring costs incurred to date, we have charged $1.2 million of cumulative translation adjustments against net income (loss) and an approximately $0.8 million of tax benefit was realized upon liquidation of these foreign entities.   
 DP Engineering Restructuring   
 During the third quarter of 2019, we implemented a restructuring plan as a result of the work suspension of DP Engineering’s largest customer and subsequent notification on August 6, 2019 that the EOC contract was being terminated.  Accordingly, we took the necessary measures to reduce DP Engineering’s workforce by approximately 12 full-time employees and terminated one of its office leases early resulting in a one-time cost of $0.3 million being paid in the third quarter of 2019. As a result of this plan, we incurred $0.2 million of restructuring costs to align the workforce to the expected level of business for the years ended December 31, 2020.   
 Lease abandonment   
 As of December 31, 2019, management decided to cease-use and abandoned a portion of several operating lease right of use lease assets in a long idled space in our Sykesville office and in DP Engineering’s Fort Worth office. This was decided as part of the on-going international restructuring plans to right size the organization. Management determined the square footage which would remain in use and took steps to ensure the abandoned space was separated from the remaining in use space, end access of all employees to the abandoned sections, and remove any remaining office furniture assets. We applied the abandonment guidance in ASC 360-10-35. We believe “abandonment” means ceasing to use the underlying asset and lacking either the intent or the ability to sublease the underlying asset. Accordingly, lease abandonment restructuring charges incurred relating to the right of use assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $1.5 million. No additional charges were incurred for the year ended December 31, 2021.   


  The following table shows the abandoned square footage and right of use asset details:

  Expected Restructuring Costs   
 We expect no additional restructuring costs under the international restructuring plan. As a part of the DP restructuring, the right sizing effort had led to the lease abandonment and related impairment as mentioned above. In a continuing effort to align our workforce and by extension the available workspace, we expect future restructuring as we continue to migrate out of the Sykesville office. At this time management is unable to estimate the ultimate restructuring costs or timeline over which these costs will be recognized.    Table of Contents
   7.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets   
    During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we recognized an impairment charge of $4.3 million of certain intangible assets as a result of the valuation analysis performed. The need for the valuation analysis was triggered by the macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations. This analysis did not indicate impairment of goodwill.    
  Our Step 1 goodwill impairment analysis includes the use of a discounted cash flow model that requires management to make assumptions regarding estimates of growth rates used to forecast revenue, operating margin and terminal value as well as determining the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other factors that impact fair value determinations.    
  We monitor operating results and events and circumstances that may indicate potential impairment of intangible assets. We perform an annual intangible assets impairment analysis at the year end, which includes the use of undiscounted cash flow and discounted cash flow models that requires management to make assumptions regarding estimates of growth rates used to forecast revenue, operating margin and terminal value as well as determining the appropriate risk adjusted discount rates and other factors that impact fair value determinations. The current assessment has no indication of impairment.    
  Management determined no additional triggering impact occurred during the year ended December 31, 2021.         The following table shows the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of definite-lived intangible assets:

   8.  Contract Receivables   
 Contract receivables represent our unconditional rights to consideration due from a broad base of both domestic and international customers. Net contract receivables are considered to be collectible within twelve months.   
  Recoverable costs and accrued profit not billed represent costs incurred and associated profit accrued on contracts that will become billable upon future milestones or completion of contracts. The components of contract receivables are as follows:   
 
(in thousands) | December 31, | 
--------------------------------+--------------+-------
 | 2021 | | | 2020 | 
Billed receivables | $ | 6,124 | | | $ | 5,694 | 
Unbilled receivables | | 6,143 | | | | 5,160 | 
Allowance for doubtful accounts | | (1,010 | ) | | | (360 | )
Total contract receivables, net | $ | 11,257 | | | $ | 10,494 | 

   
  Management reviews collectability of receivables periodically and records an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce our receivables to their net realizable value when it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical trends of past due accounts, write-offs, and specific identification and review of customer accounts. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded bad debt expense of $678 thousand and $103 thousand, respectively. Included in the current year provision is an impairment of unbilled receivables of $824 thousand related to a customer contract with our GSE Beijing entity offset by $133 thousand recovery of bad debt from previously written off balances.
   
 During January 2022, we invoiced $2.1 million of the unbilled amounts related to the balance at December 31, 2021.

   11.  Product Warranty   
 Accrued warranty      For contracts that contain a warranty provision, we provide an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based on historical experience and projected claims. Our contracts may contain warranty provisions ranging from one year to five years. The current portion of the accrued warranty is presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets within current liabilities whereas the noncurrent portion is included in other liabilities.

   12.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
 ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820) defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.   
 The levels of the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820 are:   
 Level 1: inputs are quoted prices, unadjusted, in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.   
 Level 2: inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. A Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 

 
 Level 3: inputs are unobservable and reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.   
 As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we considered the recorded value of certain of our financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, contract receivable and accounts payable, to approximate fair value based upon their short-term nature.      During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not have any transfers into or out of Level 3. The following table presents assets measured at fair value at December 31, 2021:

  13.  Debt    
   On December 29, 2016, we entered a 3-year $5.0 million revolving line of credit facility (“RLOC”) with the Citizens Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”) to fund general working capital needs and acquisitions. On May 11, 2018, we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement (the “Credit Agreement” or the “Credit Facility”) to (a) expand the RLOC to include a letter of credit sub-facility and not be subject to a borrowing base and (b) to add a $25.0 million term loan facility, available to finance permitted acquisitions over the following 18 months. The credit facility was subject to certain financial covenants and reporting requirements and was scheduled to mature on May 11, 2023 and accrue interest at the USD LIBOR, plus a margin that varies depending on our overall leverage ratio. The RLOC had required monthly payments of only interest, with principal due at maturity, while our term loan draws required monthly payments of principal and interest based on an amortization schedule. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiaries, Hyperspring, Absolute, True North, DP Engineering and by any future material domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the “Guarantors”). We subsequently amended and ratified the Credit Agreement a number of times. More recently, during 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our operations and our projected ability to comply with certain financial covenants. As such, we amended the credit facility at various dates in 2020 to revise our fixed charge ratio and leverage ratio requirements as well as our Adjusted EBITDA requirement. In exchange for relaxed covenants or waivers of covenants for certain periods, we were required by the Bank to curtail our term debt, and as a part of the Eighth Amendment and Reaffirmation Agreement, entered into in June of 2020, we repaid the entire outstanding balance on the term loan facility.          Due to a projected violation of the leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter, we signed the Ninth Amendment and Reaffirmation Agreement with an effective date of March 29, 2021. Pursuant to the Ninth Amendment and Reaffirmation Agreement, the Bank waived the fixed charge coverage ratio and leverage ratio for the quarters ending March 31 and June 30, 2021, and we agreed, for each quarter thereafter, that the fixed charge coverage ratio shall not be less than 1.10 to 1.00. In addition, we agreed to not exceed a maximum leverage ratio starting on September 30, 2021 as follows: (i) 3.25 to 1.00 for the period ending September 30, 2021; (ii) 3.00 to 1.00 for the period ending on December 31, 2021, (iii) 2.75 to 1.00 for the period ending March 31, 2022; (iv) 2.50 to 1.00 for the period ending June 30, 2022 and (v) 2.00 to 1.00 for the periods ending September 30, 2022 and each December 31st, March 31st, June 30th and September 30th thereafter. We were also required to maintain a minimum of $2.5 million in aggregate USA liquidity. As part of the amendment, we agreed, at closing, (i) to make a $500,000 pay down of RLOC; (ii) RLOC commitment to be reduced to $4.25 million; and (iii) $0.5 million of RLOC will only be available for issuance of Letters of Credit. We also agreed to pay $0.5 million to reduce RLOC to $3.75 million by June 30, 2021 and to $3.5 million by September 30, 2021. Commencing December 31, 2021 and on the last day of each quarter, we will pay $75,000 to reduce the RLOC. We incurred $25,000 fees related to this amendment during the year ended December 31, 2021.          Table of Contents
  Following the Ninth Amendment and Reaffirmation Agreement, due to Q3 2021 violations of the leverage ratio covenant, we signed the Tenth Amendment and Reaffirmation Agreement with an effective date of November 12, 2021, with our bank to waive the fixed charge coverage ratio and leverage ratio for the quarters ending September 30 and December 31, 2021, and we agreed, (i) interest on the outstanding principal amount of the RLOC shall accrue at the interest rate in effect for the RLOC from time to time, but the interest due and payable on the RLOC on each Interest Payment Date shall be determined by subtracting seventy-five (75) basis points from the Applicable Margin and (ii) the seventy-five (75) basis points of accrued interest on the RLOC not paid on any Interest Payment Date pursuant to clause (i) above shall be due and payable on the Termination Date or the date of payment in full of the RLOC. RLOC Amount” means (i) $3,500,000 (ii) on each date a payment in the amount of $250,000 is made pursuant to Subsection 2.1.5(d), the RLOC Amount immediately prior to such payment reduced by $250,000 and (iii) on March 31, 2022 and on each June 30, September 30, December 31 and March 31 thereafter, the RLOC Amount immediately prior to each such date reduced by $37,500. In addition, we agreed, by December 31, 2021, we will pay the Bank $250,000 to be applied to the principal amount outstanding under the RLOC. Commencing on March 31, 2022 and on each June 30, September 30, December 31 and March 31 thereafter, we will pay the Bank $75,000 to be applied to the principal amount outstanding under the RLOC. In addition, within the fifth (5th) Business Day after we have received, subsequent to November 1, 2021, Employee Retention Credits in an aggregate amount not less than $500,000, we will pay the Bank $250,000 to be applied to the principal amount outstanding under the RLOC. We are also required to maintain a minimum of $2.25 million in aggregate USA liquidity. We incurred $15 thousand of amendment fee related to this amendment.          On February 23, 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Lind Global Fund II LP (“Lind Global”), pursuant to which we issued to Lind Global a two-year, secured, interest-free convertible promissory note to pay off the Revolving Line of Credit balance with Citizens Bank (See Note 24).          Revolving Line of Credit (“RLOC”)          As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding borrowings of $1.8 million under the RLOC and four letters of credit totaling $1.1 million outstanding to certain of our customers. The total borrowing capacity under the RLOC was $3.25 million as of December 31, 2021. After consideration of letters of credit and the $0.5 million reserved for issuance of new letters of credit, there was no amount available for borrowing under the RLOC.          Using proceeds from the Convertible Note (further described in Note 24), we repaid in full, all outstanding indebtedness owed to Citizens, and the Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement between us, our subsidiaries, and Citizens has been terminated.  We will continue to maintain a cash management account and certain letters of credit with Citizens and, accordingly, have entered into a certain Cash Management Agreement with Citizens, as well as certain Cash Pledge Agreements in amounts corresponding to the current outstanding letters of credits with customers (as described above).          14.  Derivative Instruments   
 In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency values and interest rate changes. We may seek to control a portion of these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative instruments.    Foreign Currency Risk Management   
 Our foreign currency denominated contract receivables, billings in excess of revenue earned and subcontractor accruals that are related to the outstanding foreign exchange contracts are remeasured at the end of each period into our functional currency, using the current exchange rate at the end of the period. The gain or loss resulting from such remeasurement is also included in loss on derivative instruments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.   
 We utilize foreign currency exchange contracts to manage market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and to minimize credit exposure by limiting counterparties to nationally recognized financial institutions.   
 As of December 31, 2021, we had no foreign exchange contracts outstanding.   
 Interest Rate Risk Management      For the periods presented, we did not elect to designate any of our derivative contracts as hedges. Changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts are included in loss on derivative instruments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

 The difference between the effective rate and statutory rate in 2021 primarily resulted from a change in valuation allowance, permanent differences, including PPP Loan forgiveness and foreign restructuring, accruals related to uncertain tax positions, the tax impact of stock compensation forfeitures, foreign taxes, and state tax expense.
   
 
  Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. A summary of the tax effect of the significant components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities is as follows:

  We file tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and in several state and foreign jurisdictions. Because of the net operating loss carryforwards, we are subject to U.S. federal and state income tax examinations for tax years 2000, and forward, and is subject to foreign tax examinations by tax authorities for the years 2016 and forward. Open tax years related to state and foreign jurisdictions remain subject to examination but are not considered material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
   
      
 In assessing the ability to realize our deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends primarily upon the preponderance of positive evidence that could be demonstrated by three-year cumulative positive earnings, reversal of existing deferred temporary differences, and generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of deductible temporary differences.   
 As of each reporting date, our management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact management's view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. This analysis is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.   
 We performed an analysis of the valuation allowance position for its worldwide deferred tax assets and determined that a valuation allowance continues to be necessary on its U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets at December 31, 2021.   


  Table of Contents
 As of December 31, 2021, our largest deferred tax asset was $6.2 million of net operating losses. It primarily relates to a U.S. net operating loss carryforward of $6.2 million; $4.5 million of the net operating loss carryforward expires in various amounts between 2023 and 2037; $1.7 million of the net operating loss carryforward is an indefinite-lived deferred tax asset. We do not believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize its deferred tax assets for its U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets at December 31, 2021 and therefore we have maintained a $9.4 million valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets. The Company has a deferred tax liability in the amount of $93 thousand at December 31, 2021 related to the portion of Goodwill which cannot be offset by deferred tax assets.

 
 As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.6 million and $6.7 million, respectively, including cash and cash equivalents held at non-U.S. entities totaling $1.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively. The non-U.S. entities include operating subsidiaries located in China. We do not assert permanent reinvestment in China. Accordingly, we analyzed the cumulative earnings and profits and determined the US deferred liability related to this position is immaterial.   
 Uncertain Tax Positions   
 During 2021 and 2020, we recorded tax liabilities for certain foreign tax contingencies. We recorded these uncertain tax positions in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.   
  The following table outlines our uncertain tax liabilities, including accrued interest and penalties for each jurisdiction:

  Table of Contents

   16.  Capital Stock   The total authorized shares of capital stock we are authorized to issue equals 62,000,000 total shares of stock of which 60,000,000 are designated as common stock and 2,000,000 are designated as preferred stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority to establish one or more classes of preferred stock and to determine, within any class of preferred stock, the preferences, rights and other terms of such class.   As of December 31, 2021, the Company has reserved 7,500,000 shares of common stock for issuance; zero are reserved for shares upon exercise of outstanding stock options and 1,595,665 are reserved for shares upon vesting of restricted stock units. There are 1,266,479 shares available for future grants under the Plan (as further defined below).  
   17.  Stock-Based Compensation   
  Long-term incentive plan   During 1995, we established the 1995 Long-Term Incentive Stock Option Plan (the “Plan”), which permits the granting of stock options (including incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options) stock appreciation rights, restricted or unrestricted stock awards, phantom stock, performance awards or any combination of these to employees, directors or consultants. The Plan was amended and restated effective April 22, 2016 and expires on  April 21, 2026; the total number of shares that could be issued under the Plan is 7,500,000. As of December 31, 2021, 4,637,856 shares have been issued under the Plan, zero stock options and 1,595,665 restricted stock units (RSUs) were outstanding under the Plan, while 1,266,479 shares remain for future grants under the Plan.   
 We recognize compensation expense on a pro rata straight-line basis over the requisite service period for stock-based compensation awards with both graded and cliff vesting terms. We recognize the cumulative effect of a change in the number of awards expected to vest in compensation expense in the period of change. We have not capitalized any portion of its stock-based compensation. Our forfeiture rate is based on actuals.   During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $1.0 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense under the fair value method. Accordingly, we recognized associated deferred income tax expense (benefits) of $111 thousand and $220 thousand before valuation allowance, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no stock-based compensation expense related to the change in fair value of cash-settled RSUs, which we account for as a liability.   
 On February 23, 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Lind Global Fund II LP (“Lind Global”), pursuant to which we issued to Lind Global a two-year, secured, interest-free convertible promissory note in the amount of $5.75 million (the “Convertible Note”) and a common stock purchase warrant to acquire 1,283,732 shares of our common stock (the “Warrant”) (See Note 24).   
  Restricted Stock Units   During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we issued RSUs to employees which vest upon the achievement of specific market-based or time-based measures. The fair value for RSU's is calculated based on the stock price on the grant date and expensed ratably over the requisite service period as market-based results achieved, which ranges between one year and five years. The following table summarizes the information about vested and unvested restricted stock units for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.   
 
 | Number of Shares | | | Weighted Average Fair Value | 
------------------------------------+------------------+-----------+---+-----------------------------+--
Nonvested RSUs at January 1, 2020 | | 1,973,725 | | | $ | 1.49

Nonvested RSUs at December 31, 2021 | | 1,595,665 | | | $ | 1.77

  Table of Contents
  As of December 31, 2021, we had $0.7 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to the RSUs expected to be recognized on a pro-rata straight line basis over a weighted average remaining service period of approximately 1.2 years.     18.  Leases   
 We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease. We apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities.

 
  Lease contracts are evaluated at inception to determine whether they contain a lease and whether we obtain the right to control an identified asset. The following table summarizes the classification of operating ROU assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):   
 
Operating Leases | Classification | December 31, 2021 | | December 31, 2020 |

 During September 2020, we notified the landlord of our consolidated subsidiary Absolute’s home office of our decision not to renew the lease.   
  We executed a sublease agreement with a tenant to sublease 850 square feet from the Sykesville office space on September 13, 2021. This agreement is in addition to the previous sublease for 3,650 square feet entered into on May 1, 2019. The addition of the second sublease is for a portion of the space previously abandoned in December 2019. The sublease does not relieve us of our primary lease obligation. The lessor agreements are all considered operating leases, maintaining the historical classification of the underlying lease. We do not recognize any underlying assets for the subleases as a lessor of operating leases. The net amount received from the sublease is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.   
  The table below summarizes the lease income and expenses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations incurred year to date ended December 31, 2021, (in thousands):   
 
Lease Cost | Classification | Twelve months ended December 31, 2021 |

   19.  Employee Benefits   
 We have a qualified defined contribution plan that covers all U.S. employees under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under this plan, our stipulated basic contribution matches a portion of the participants’ contributions based upon a defined schedule for employee’s in our Performance Improvement Solutions segment. Our contributions to the plan were approximately $290 thousand and $260 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.     20.  Segment Information   
 We have two reportable business segments.   The Performance Improvement Solutions segment provides simulation, training and engineering products and services delivered across the breadth of industries we serve. Solutions include simulation for both training and engineering applications. Examples of engineering services include, but are not limited to, plant design verification and validation, thermal performance evaluation and optimization programs, and engineering programs for plants for ASME code and ASME Section XI. We provide these services across all market segments through our Performance, True North, and DP Engineering subsidiaries. Example training applications include turnkey and custom training services. Contract terms are typically less than two years.    Table of Contents
 The Workforce Solutions segment provides specialized workforce solutions primarily to the nuclear industry, working at clients’ facilities. This business is managed through our Hyperspring and Absolute subsidiaries. The business model, management focus, margins and other factors clearly separate this business line from the rest of our products and services portfolio.   
  The following table sets forth the revenue and operating results attributable to each reportable segment and includes a reconciliation of segment revenue to consolidated revenue and operating results to consolidated income before income tax expense (benefit). Inter-segment revenue is eliminated in consolidation and is not significant.

  Revenues by geographic location above are attributed to the contracting entity.  Therefore, revenues from a foreign customer that contracted directly with our U.S. entity are included in revenues from the United States. All revenues in Asia were attributable to our Chinese subsidiary.   
 Alternatively, revenue from customers domiciled in foreign countries were approximately 12% and 17%, of our consolidated 2021 and 2020 revenue, respectively.  Revenue from foreign countries where our customers reside were all individually less than 10% of our consolidated revenue during 2021 and 2020.

   22.  Non-consolidated Variable Interest Entity   
 Through our wholly owned subsidiary, DP Engineering, we effectively hold a 48% membership interest in DP-NXA Consultants LLC (“DP-NXA”).   DP-NXA was established to provide industrial services that include civil, structural, architectural, electrical, fire protection, plumbing, mechanical consulting engineering services to customers. DP-NXA sub-contracts their work to its two owners, NXA Consultants LLC (“NXA”), which owns 52% of the entity, and DP Engineering. DP Engineering and NXA contributed $48 thousand and $52 thousand, respectively, for 48% and 52% interest in DP-NXA. DP Engineering recorded the contributed cash as an equity investment.   We evaluated the nature of DP Engineering’s investment in DP-NXA and determined that DP-NXA is a variable interest entity (“VIE”). Since we do not have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact DP-NXA, we cannot be DP-NXA’s primary beneficiary. Furthermore, we concluded that we do not hold a controlling financial interest in DP-NXA since NXA, the VIE’s majority owner, makes all operational and business decisions. We account for DP Engineering’s investment in DP-NXA using the equity method of accounting due to the fact DP Engineering exerts significant influence with its 48% of membership interest, but does not control the financial and operating decisions.   Our maximum exposure to any losses incurred by DP-NXA is limited to DP Engineering’s investment. As of December 31, 2021, DP Engineering has not made any additional contributions to DP-NXA and we believe DP Engineering’s maximum exposure to any losses incurred by DP-NXA was not material. As of December 31, 2021, we do not have existing guarantee with or to DP-NXA, or any third-party work contracted with it.   For the year ended December 31, 2021, the carrying value of the investment in DP-NXA was zero. We do not have any investment income or loss from DP-NXA for the year ended December 31, 2021.

 23.  Commitments and Contingencies   
 Joyce v. Absolute Consulting, Inc.   
 On March 29, 2019, a former employee of Absolute Consulting, Inc., filed a putative class action against us and Absolute, Joyce v. Absolute Consulting Inc., case number 1:19 cv 00868 RDB, in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuit alleged that the plaintiff and certain other employees were not properly compensated for overtime hours worked. We were subsequently dismissed from the case, leaving Absolute as the sole defendant.   
 On August 17, 2020, Absolute entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs (the “Settlement Agreement”), with a maximum settlement amount of $1.5 million which required approval by the Court. On September 8, 2020, the Settlement Agreement was approved by the Court, and the case was dismissed, although the parties remain bound by   the terms of the Settlement Agreement. On September 29, 2020, we received $952 thousand from a general escrow account, originally set up as part of our purchase of Absolute during fiscal year 2017. We presented the loss related to the above-described settlement and the benefit from the above described proceeds from the release of escrow from the Absolute transaction in, selling, general and administrative expenses, in the amount of $477 thousand for the year ended December 31,2021. Following the Court’s approval, Absolute made an initial payment toward the settlement amount in the amount of $625 thousand, which amount included legal fees. After the expiration of an opt-in notice period, the final cost of settling this case, including plaintiff’s attorney fees was approximately $1.4 million. Approximately $713 thousand of the settlement amount was paid out prior to December 31, 2020. Approximately $694 thousand was paid out in 2021. No liability remains as of December 31, 2021.

 
 Per ASC 450 Accounting for Contingencies, we review potential items and areas where a loss contingency could arise. In the opinion of management, we are not a party to any legal proceeding, the outcome of which, in management’s opinion, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows, other than as noted above. We expense legal defense costs as incurred.   
 We, from time to time, are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business. While it is too early to determine the outcome of such matters, management does not expect the resolution of these matters to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  
  
  24. Subsequent Events        
 On February 23, 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Lind Global Fund II LP (“Lind Global”), pursuant to which we issued to Lind Global a two-year, secured, interest-free convertible promissory note in the amount of $5.75 million (the “Convertible Note”) and a common stock purchase warrant to acquire 1,283,732 shares of our common stock (the “Warrant”).  
     The Convertible Note is convertible into our common stock at any time after the earlier of six (6) months from issuance of the Convertible Note or the date the registration statement is effective. The conversion price of the Convertible Note is equal to $1.94, subject to customary adjustments. The Convertible Note will reach maturity in February of 2024, although we are permitted to prepay the Convertible Note, provided that Lind Global shall have the option to convert up to one third of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Note at a price per share equal to the lessor of the Repayment Share price or the conversion price (as described below). The Convertible Note is guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries and is secured by a first priority lien on all of our assets. The Convertible Note is not subject to any financial covenants and events of default under the Convertible Note are limited to events related to payment, certain events pertaining to the underlying shares of common stock and other customary events including, but not limited to, bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Convertible Note will become immediately due and payable, subject to any cure periods described in the Convertible Note, and the customer may demand that all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount be converted into shares of common stock at the lower of the then current conversion price and 80% of the average of the three (3) lowest daily volume-weighted average price (“VWAPs”) during the twenty (20) days prior to delivery of the conversion notice. If there is a change of control of the Company, Lind Global has the right to require us to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Note. A portion of the proceeds of the Convertible Note were used to repay, in full, all outstanding indebtedness owed to Citizens, and the Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement between us, our subsidiaries, and Citizens was terminated.  We will continue to maintain a cash management account and certain letters of credit with Citizens and, accordingly, have entered into a certain Cash Management Agreement with Citizens, as well as certain Cash Pledge Agreements in amounts corresponding to the current outstanding letters of credits with customers (as described in Note 13). 
        
 The Warrant entitles Lind Global to purchase up to 1,283,732 shares of our common stock until February 23, 2027, at an exercise price of $1.94 per share, subject to customary adjustments described therein.
