Item 1. Business
Overview
Castlight Health, Inc. (“Castlight”, “the Company” or "we") offers a comprehensive software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) platform that simplifies health benefits navigation for millions of employees. Our platform matches employees to the best resources their employers make available to them - whether they are healthy, actively seeking medical care, or managing a condition - and motivates them to take the best steps for their health. Castlight helps employers generate more value from their benefits investments by helping to improve outcomes, lower health care costs, and increase benefits satisfaction. 
Castlight’s platform solution supports strong employee engagement and satisfaction through two foundational components: an ecosystem of deep integrations across an employer’s various health and wellbeing partners, and a predictive analytics “engine” that uses claims, demographic and user data and machine learning to personalize clinical options, benefit programs, wellbeing incentives, communications, and educational content, based on each employee’s specific health and wellbeing needs.
This unique combination of data integrations and personalization puts Castlight in a position to deliver value to employees and their employers. For employees, our platform improves their health benefits experience, with a highly-engaging, seamless mobile application and web experience, which are coupled with multi-channel communications. In addition, the platform’s rewards feature is designed to incentivize individuals to participate in health programs, optimize their care utilization, and improve their daily habits. For employers, Castlight provides a simplified, cost-effective, and flexible way to help manage health benefits: helping them to procure, deploy, manage, and measure healthcare and wellbeing program vendors through a single platform.
Castlight was incorporated in the State of Delaware in January 2008. Its first generation care guidance solutions addressed the needs of employees actively seeking care or managing a chronic condition and serve as the foundation of our current care guidance offering. In 2015, we launched Castlight Action, our data-driven personalization benefits content and recommendations platform, which has been integrated into all of our products and re-branded as Castlight Genius. In April 2017, we acquired Jiff, Inc. Jiff provided an enterprise health benefits platform that served as a central hub for employee wellbeing and employee benefit programs and is the foundation for our wellbeing offering. In 2018, Castlight launched two offerings that deliver health care and wellbeing benefits navigation in a single user experience: Engage (January) and Castlight Complete (September). The Company's principal executive offices are located in San Francisco, California.

Our Opportunity
Health benefits is one of the largest categories of spend for U.S. employers, and is also an area of increasing complexity for employers and employees: 

• | According to The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), U.S. private health insurance spending is estimated to be $1.24 trillion in 2018 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.4% through 2022.


• | Employers seek to deploy more digital health offerings to improve employee satisfaction and outcomes but are faced with evaluating and managing an ever-increasing number of digital health point solutions for their employees. Rock Health estimates that more than $29 billion was invested in U.S. digital health companies from 2013 to 2018, across more than 1,800 funding rounds. While this explosion in digital health options has been overwhelming for human resource executives responsible for health benefits evaluation, selection and spend, these solutions are seen as key drivers of employee engagement.


• | The proliferation of so many healthcare and wellbeing offerings has also led to another problem for employees: underutilization of the benefits actually provided to employees. A March 2017 study by NBGH and Fidelity has shown utilization rates that are less than 20% for key benefits offerings like financial wellness, weight management, condition management, and resilience.

As a result of these factors, we believe there is a significant, long-term market opportunity for us to offer a technology-based solution that helps increase financial and management efficiencies for employers in providing benefits, while improving employee benefit utilization.

Our Solution
We have developed a comprehensive health navigation platform that utilizes an ecosystem approach and data-driven personalization to match individual employees to the best resources available to them, and motivate them to take action. This, in turn, helps employers manage their benefits more effectively, and generate more value from their benefits investments. 
Key factors that allow us to provide our solution in a unique way include the following:
Depth and Breadth of Data Integrations, including Health Plans. Our data and point solution partner integrations provide us with access to valuable data assets that we leverage to personalize our users’ experience which helps drive engagement, close gaps in care, and steer employees to the right providers based on their specific health needs and plan design. Our systems are designed to deliver these services in compliance with HIPAA and other applicable regulations.
Our data integrations include: 


• | access to claims data and other data through all major health plans and many of the largest pharmacy benefits managers and dental carriers;


• | demographic information from employer eligibility files;


• | real-time employee search and benefit utilization information through integrations with point solution partners;


• | connection to an employer’s plan design, including understanding each employee’s selected health plan, their network configuration, and their real-time deductible status;


• | data from numerous validated and nationally recognized provider quality sources;


• | Health Savings Accounts;


• | biometric data.

The Castlight Ecosystem. The Castlight Ecosystem leverages an open architecture to simplify benefit vendor integration and management for the employer. We can integrate our platform with nearly any vendor to create one seamless experience, and employers can use our Preferred Partners to purchase and manage third-party digital health applications and services across categories such as: activity and fitness tracking; biometrics; financial wellbeing; health risk assessment; mental health; nutrition management; second opinion; sleep management; smoking cessation; weight management; and areas of condition management in areas like cardiovascular, diabetes, maternal health, and musculoskeletal.

Data-Driven Personalization. Castlight Genius ("Genius"), previously marketed as Castlight Action, is an intelligent personalization engine that leverages our vast data resources and helps guide employees to the right benefits resource. Starting with new sales in 2018, Genius is now embedded into all Castlight packages described below. Castlight utilizes a variety of data sources to build employee segments, each with unique health needs and opportunities. Example data sources we use to power Genius include: search data, claims data, ecosystem partner data, employee interests and preferences, and demographic data from an employer’s eligibility file. Based upon its analysis of these data categories, Castlight Genius can deliver relevant content and recommendations to each population segment through communications channels, such as in-app and website content, email, and mobile push notifications. Recommendations categories include specific programs for those at risk for depression or anxiety; encouraging behaviors such as identifying and recommending a primary care physician; care options such as back pain care based on claims data; predictive content such as those who are at-risk for back surgery; and engagement incentives to encourage utilization of an available diabetes management program for those with the condition. 
Comprehensive Employee Experience. We deliver a user experience that is designed to be the first place employees go whenever they have a health benefits related need. We believe we are uniquely positioned in the market, given the breadth of features and capabilities we have developed, our ecosystem partners; and our unique integrations with all the major health plans. Whether an employee is healthy, accessing care, or managing a condition, we can engage them with personalized content and deliver valuable employer communications. We deliver these all through an engaging website and mobile applications.

Our Products
We sell our health navigation platform primarily through three available packages: 
Care Guidance Navigator: Our Care Guidance Navigator provides employees with what they need to make better care decisions and navigate an employer’s programs through an experience that is tailored specifically for an employer’s networks, health plans, care options, and programs. By helping employees choose the right benefit and right care option at the right time, we can improve their satisfaction with benefits while helping their employer achieve costs savings.
Wellbeing Navigator: Our personalized, incentivized Wellbeing Navigator helps drive engagement across an employer’s entire benefits program. Wellbeing Navigator leverages a robust data set, advanced personalization and incentives to drive engagement, improve health and increase employee satisfaction.
Complete Health Navigator: Castlight Complete Navigator is configured to address the unique needs of an organization and guides employees through the complete health journey in a single platform. Whether they are working to stay healthy, accessing care or managing a condition, we can serve them with personalized content and communications through a single user experience. This package combines the full functionality of the Wellbeing Navigator and Care Guidance Navigator packages.
All the above Navigator packages include ecosystem integrations, the Castlight Genius personalization engine, and an engagement hub that aggregates all employee benefits, personalized recommendations and communications into one central location. 
We offer each of our three Navigator packages in two versions: Enterprise and Express. The Enterprise versions are configurable for larger employers with more complex benefit designs and larger numbers of vendor integrations. For mid-size employers, we offer Express versions of our packages, which are pre-configured to facilitate faster implementation and more streamlined management, providing the same base functionality, but no custom integrations.
In addition to the above three packages, we offer Elevate as a buy-up product and Engage through Anthem Inc., both of which are described below:
Elevate: All customers may purchase our behavioral health module, Castlight Elevate, which guides users to the available behavioral health resources such as employee assistance programs, cognitive behavioral therapy and teletherapy. 
Engage: In addition to the three Navigator packages we sell directly, we also use our platform to power an offering sold through Anthem, Inc. called Engage. Engage delivers the power and personalized user experience of the Castlight platform to Anthem members with additional features available through deep integrations with Anthem’s own assets, such as

the Anthem Health Guide concierge, Anthem’s clinical and care management programs, and Anthem’s gaps-in-care and clinical analytics. Engage is offered in multiple packages, including a more streamlined version that can be offered by Anthem to its smaller size clients. As of December 31, 2018, Engage was available to Anthem, Inc. national accounts and large group accounts in eleven states. See “Strategic Relationships” under the caption “Anthem, Inc.” elsewhere in Item 1 to this Form 10-K for additional information on Engage.
Our Services
We provide a range of services to help employers implement and maximize the value of our offering, including: 

• | Implementation Services. We provide implementation services to our customers to help ensure successful deployment of our offering, including executing required data feeds, loading customer data, configuring products, integrating with third-party and other applications, communication and comprehensive testing. We also offer communications services to drive employee engagement with our offering that span educational presentations, email campaigns, print collateral and employer-specific media. Communications initiatives are typically run during open enrollment, time of product launch and periodically post launch, and are designed to drive employee engagement and change management. The fees for these services are included as part of our contracts.


• | User and Customer Support. We offer end user support to help ensure effective employee use of our platform. We provide telephonic, live chat and email support for employees and their families in the areas of account maintenance, technical issue resolution, and navigation of online services. In addition, we assist employees with finding care, understanding their benefits, and interpreting past claims, bills, and total spend. We also enable employees who may have limited computer access to obtain their personalized health care information using our customer support personnel. We offer interactive sessions to our customers that help them understand impact of our product through various standard and customized reporting and provide deeper insights about their employee population with a focus on employee engagement. The fees for these services are included as part of our subscription contracts.


• | Marketplace: Store and Rewards Center. To help employers drive employee engagement with their benefits, we offer an online store where employers can offer third-party health products and services (e.g. fitness trackers) to their employees for use with Wellbeing Navigator’s activity tracking functionality. Additionally, we power a Rewards Center where employees can redeem incentive points for items such as contributions to the HSA accounts, gift cards, and donations to charity. Revenues from products sold through our online market place is recognized on a net basis principally because we are not the primary obligor to the end-customers. 

Customers
As of December 31, 2018, we had $150.5 million in signed annual recurring revenue (“ARR”). Together, our customers encompass millions of eligible employees and their families. Our customers consist primarily of large self-insured employers, representing a wide range of industries, such as education, manufacturing, retail, technology and government, and includes some of the largest employers in the United States. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a distinct business unit of a large corporation, which has entered into a master subscription agreement with us to access our platform, including customers that are in the process of deploying our platform to employee populations.
Employees and Culture
We view our employees and company culture as critical assets for our business and a source of competitive strength. Our leadership team is focused on supporting our employees and fostering our unique culture. We believe this has enabled us to attract and retain some of the best minds in technology and health care to build and advance our platform.
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 470 full-time employees. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

Sales and Marketing
We have a hybrid sales model that leverages a national direct sales organization and strong channel partner relationships. 
Our direct sales team comprises enterprise-focused field sales professionals who are organized into geography-based teams. Our field professionals target large, self-insured U.S. employers and are supported by a sales operations staff, including product technology experts, lead generation professionals and sales data experts.
We have also increased our focus on indirect sales through a variety of channels, most notably through our go-to-market relationship with Anthem, Inc. (See "Strategic Relationships" below.) We also maintain relationships with key industry participants including benefit consultants, brokers, group purchasing organizations, and health plan partners. These channel partners can support our sales efforts to varying degrees by sourcing prospects, and working in collaboration with our direct sales team during the sales process. Through these relationships, we believe we are able to reach a broader set of potential customers and leverage existing relationships to promote our health benefits platform and products.
We also generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs and strategic relationships. Our marketing programs target human resource executives and benefits leaders in addition to senior business leaders and health care and benefits channel partners. Our principal marketing programs include value-add research and learning opportunities for potential customers, channel marketing, demand generation activities, field marketing events, direct e-mail campaigns and participation in user conferences, industry events, trade shows and customer conferences.
Technology and Operations
We have designed our technology infrastructure to provide a highly available and secure multi-tenant cloud-based offering. Our multi-tenant platforms allow us to use a standard data model and consistent management practices for all customers with multiple possible configurations, while securely partitioning each customer’s application data. This approach provides significant operating leverage and improved efficiency as it helps us reduce our fixed cost base and minimize unused capacity on our hardware. 
The architecture, deployment and management of our technology are focused on: 

• | Scalability. We have developed a robust and scalable data architecture infrastructure, which allows for automated loading and normalization of numerous data sources, including billions of claim transactions in our data warehouse.


• | Standardization. Our technology assimilates structured and unstructured data from disparate sources, and employs unique algorithms to convert these data into user-friendly information for our users. Additionally, we operate using Services Oriented Architecture principles, with a platform of services that serve to deliver the application in a scalable and standardized way.


• | Security. We maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to ensure the security and integrity of customer data, protect against security threats or data breaches and prevent unauthorized access to our data or the data of our customers. We strictly regulate and limit all access to on-demand servers and networks at our production and remote backup facilities. All users are validated, authenticated and authorized before they can access our system. Users must have a valid user ID and associated password to log on to our services. We require Transport Layer Security between the user’s browser and our servers to protect data in transit. Encrypted backup files are transmitted over secure connections to redundant storage in a secondary data center.

We currently host our products from regionally dispersed data centers and lease third-party industry-class data center hosting facilities throughout the United States. We rely on third-party vendors to provide infrastructure support for our data centers, which are designed to host computer systems that require high levels of availability and have redundant subsystems and compartmentalized security zones. We utilize commercially available hardware for our data center servers. Our data center 
5

facilities employ advanced measures to ensure physical integrity, including redundant power and cooling systems and advanced fire and flood prevention.
Compliance and Certifications
Our software services and data are located at independently managed and third-party data center hosting facilities. We require those vendors to obtain third-party security examinations relating to security and data privacy such as Service Organization Controls (SOC) SOC 1 or SOC 2 reports. Our vendors’ examinations are conducted at least every 12 months by an independent third-party auditor, and address, among other areas, physical and environmental safeguards for production data centers, data availability and integrity procedures, change management procedures and logical security procedures. An independent auditor conducts an annual SOC 2 Type II audit of our operating processes and procedures and HITRUST certifications of our security controls. Our annual internal audits are based upon the international standard ISO/IEC 27001 that addresses, among other things, security, data privacy and operational controls.
Strategic Relationships
Data Collaborations. We have relationships with many national and regional health plans, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), dental insurers, behavioral health plans, and health savings plans to support our mutual customers. These collaborations provide us with claims, balance integrations and other data on behalf of our employer customers. We have developed technologies in collaboration with several payers including real-time integrated APIs. The increasing number of data integrations we have in place is helping to position us as a health navigation platform for our customers, and enables employers to consolidate many of their myriad sources of benefits information toward a single point of reference.
Channel Relationships. We have relationships with channel partners, which complement our direct sales capabilities. These relationships and strategies include a focus on brokers, consultants, health plans and enterprise software providers. Through these relationships, we gain the leverage to reach a broader set of potential customers and leverage existing relationships to promote our health benefits platform and products to cross-pollinate customer opportunities. 
Anthem, Inc. We continue to expand our ongoing relationship with Anthem to deliver greater shared value to our customers and Anthem’s members. In 2017, Anthem began selling Engage, a Castlight-powered health navigation platform branded by Anthem and deeply integrated with Anthem’s own programs and benefits. Today, Anthem is marketing Engage as a highly integrated mobile-first personalized health assistant for new and existing Anthem clients in its national accounts business segment as well as in its large group businesses in eleven states. Additionally, we have developed and continue to support the base technology underlying Anthem’s core care guidance offering, which Anthem is rolling out to its book of business in a phased approach.
Ecosystem Vendors. Castlight’s ecosystem provides access to more than 30 pre-integrated digital health partners that we can resell to provide a more integrated and streamlined experience for our users. In addition to our sales partnerships, Castlight also has performed over 1,000 third-party benefit integrations for our customers that deliver effortless access to these programs for our users.
Competition
Our market is in an early stage of development, but is rapidly evolving and competitive. We currently face competition from both existing and emerging vendors across a variety of categories, from specialists in the care guidance and wellbeing areas of the market, to broader offerings that compete with our full health navigation platform. A listing of some of our common competitors, grouped by major category, includes:

• | Care guidance competitors, which include: independent vendors such as ClearCost Health, Compass, Healthcare Bluebook, Accolade, HealthAdvocate, and Quantum Health; and U.S. health plans such as Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, and United Healthcare Group, Inc., and Health Services Corporation that bundle basic care guidance functionality into their offering;


• | Wellbeing competitors, which include: Limeade, VirginPulse and Vitality; and


• | Platform competitors, which include: United Healthcare Group’s Optum/Rally offering, and emerging competitors such as Evive, Welltok, and Sharecare.

6

The principal competitive factors in our industry include:


• | ability to curate complex data from multiple sources and present it through an easy to navigate user interface;


• | capability for customization through configuration, integration, security, scalability and reliability of products;


• | ease of use and rates of user engagement;


• | complimentary technology platform and high touch services;


• | breadth and depth of application functionality;


• | competitive and understandable pricing;


• | size of customer base and level of user engagement;


• | depth of access to third-party data sources;


• | ability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications;


• | ability to innovate and respond rapidly to customer needs and regulatory changes;


• | domain expertise in benefits and health care consumerism;


• | accessibility on any browser or mobile device;


• | clearly defined implementation timeline; and


• | customer branding and styling.

While we believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors, many of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution or other resources and greater name recognition than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the health care industry. We also may face competition from new entrants to the field as healthcare delivery and services continue to evolve. As a result, we may not always compare favorably with respect to certain of the above factors. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed if we fail to meet these competitive pressures.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. In addition, we may not be able to prevent others from developing technology that is similar to, but not the same as our proprietary technology. We generally require employees, consultants, customers, suppliers and partners to execute confidentiality agreements with us that restrict the disclosure of our intellectual property. We also require our employees and consultants to execute invention assignment agreements with us that protect our intellectual property rights.
As of December 31, 2018, we had one issued patent and three patent applications pending in the United States. Our issued patent expires on July 27, 2031. We own and use trademarks on or in connection with our products and services, including both unregistered common law marks and issued trademark registrations in the United States and elsewhere. We have trademark applications pending to register marks in the United States. We have also registered numerous Internet domain names. Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our products are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products with the same functionality as our offering. In addition, policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult and may not be effective.
We expect that we and others in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time. Any such claim could pose a substantial distraction to the management of the company. A successful claim of this type may be costly and could require us to spend substantial time and effort in making our offering non-infringing.
7

Strategic Acquisition
On April 3, 2017, we completed our acquisition of Jiff, Inc. Jiff provided an enterprise health benefits platform that served as a central hub for employee wellbeing and employee benefit programs and is the foundation for our Wellbeing Navigator. The acquisition enabled us to develop a product offering that provides the full spectrum of wellbeing, healthcare decision support and an engagement hub all in one complete package. 
Regulatory Environment
Participants in the health care industry are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations in the United States at the federal and state levels as well as applicable international laws. Although many regulatory and governmental requirements do not directly apply to our business, our customers are required to comply with a variety of laws, and we may be affected by these laws as a result of our contractual obligations. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the Unites States, both at the federal and state level, which could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties. We have attempted to structure our operations to comply with applicable legal requirements, but there can be no assurance that our operations will not be challenged or impacted by enforcement initiatives.
Healthcare Reform
Our business could be affected by changes in health care laws, including without limitation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which was enacted in March 2010. The ACA has changed how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of individuals, changes in Medicare program spending and insurance market reforms. Ongoing government and legislative initiatives may bring about other changes.
While most of the provisions of the ACA and other health care reform legislation will not be directly applicable to us, they may affect the business of many of our customers, which may in turn affect our business. Although we are unable to predict with any reasonable certainty or otherwise quantify the likely impact of the ACA, any amendment or repeal of the ACA,
 or other health care reform on our business model, financial condition, or results of operations, negative changes in the business of our customers and the number of individuals they insure may negatively impact our business.
Requirements Regarding the Privacy and Security of Personal Information
U.S.-HIPAA and Other Privacy and Security Requirements. There are many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal health information. For example, in June 2018, the California State Legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), a major new state law poised to affect the privacy landscape globally and allows the California Attorney General to impose fines for CCPA violations. The CCPA is effective January 1, 2020 and the earliest the California Attorney General may bring an enforcement action under the CCPA is July 1, 2020. The CCPA is applicable to our business and we plan on implementing necessary changes to our business operations. 
Additionally, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations, collectively HIPAA, establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. Our health plan customers, as well as health care clearinghouses and certain providers with which we may have or may establish business relationships, are covered entities that are regulated under HIPAA. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which became effective on February 17, 2010, significantly expanded HIPAA’s privacy and security requirements. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” who are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. Under HIPAA and our contractual agreements with our customers, we are considered a “business associate” to our customers and thus are directly subject to HIPAA’s privacy and security standards. In order to provide our covered entity customers with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, HIPAA requires our customers to enter into business associate agreements with it. Such agreements must, among other things, require us to:

• | limit how we will use and disclose the protected health information;

8


• | implement reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information from misuse;


• | enter into similar agreements with our agents and subcontractors that have access to the information;


• | report security incidents, breaches and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of the information; and


• | assist the customer in question with certain duties under the privacy standards.

                In addition to HIPAA regulations, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair or deceptive practices and laws that place specific requirements on use of data. We cannot provide assurance regarding how the various privacy and security laws will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations.
International Privacy Requirements. In Europe, we are subject to the 1995 European Union (“EU”) Directive on Data Protection (“1995 Data Protection Directive”), which requires EU member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the United States. The EU member state regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data, including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the EU to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security. In addition, certain member states have adopted more stringent data protection standards. The Company has addressed these requirements by certification to the EU/US Privacy Shield framework the European Commission deemed the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework adequate to enable data transfers under EU law July 12, 2016. On January 12, 2017, the Swiss Government announced the approval of the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as a valid legal mechanism to comply with Swiss requirements when transferring personal data from Switzerland to the United States.
On December 15, 2015, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (Council) reached a political agreement on the future EU data protection legal framework. Formally adopted by the European Parliament in 2016, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) replaced the 1995 Data Protection Directive. GDPR went into effect in May 2018. GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of European Union residents that are different than those currently in place in the European Union, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.
Data Protection and Breaches. In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of individuals’ personal information. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials. In addition, under HIPAA, we must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to our contractual partners within 60 days of discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain circumstances involving large breaches, to the media. Under the GDPR, the data controller is required to report personal data breaches to the supervisory authority within 72 hours of discovery of the breach.
We have implemented and maintained physical, technical and administrative safeguards intended to protect all personal data, and have processes in place to assist it in complying with all applicable laws, regulations and contractual requirements regarding the protection of these data and properly responding to any security breaches or incidents. However, we cannot be sure that these safeguards are adequate to protect all personal data or to assist us in complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the privacy and security of personal data and responding to any security breaches or incidents. Furthermore, in many cases, applicable state laws, including breach notification requirements, are not preempted by the HIPAA privacy and security standards and are subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thereby complicating our compliance efforts. Additionally, state and federal laws regarding deceptive practices may apply to public assurances we give to individuals about the security of services we provide on behalf of our contractual customers.
Other Requirements. In addition to HIPAA, numerous other U.S. state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information and health care provider information. Some states also are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality, privacy and security of medical records or other types of medical information. In many cases, these state laws are not preempted by the HIPAA privacy standards and may be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities. Further, 
9

Congress and a number of states have considered or are considering prohibitions or limitations on the disclosure of medical or other information to individuals or entities located outside of the United States.
We dedicate significant resources to protecting our customers’ confidential and protected health information, or PHI. Our security strategy employs various practices and technology to control and protect access to sensitive information. In February 2019, our application and infrastructure received certification status from the Health Information Trust Alliance, or HITRUST, the healthcare industry group that certifies an entity’s material compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations that have been issued under it, which we collectively refer to as HIPAA, and various states’ security and privacy laws regarding the creation, access, storage or exchange of personal health and financial information. Our certification status signifies that we exhibit and are able to maintain high security standards of electronic PHI.
