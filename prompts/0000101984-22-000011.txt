We released software updates to our embedded QuickSet application, and continued development initiatives around existing and emerging technologies, such as Rf4CE, Bluetooth, Bluetooth Smart WiFi and Matter, a unifying, IP-based connectivity protocol built on proven technologies designed to connect smart home devices reliably and securely across disparate IoT ecosystems. We continue to enhance the capabilities of our service platform (UEI Virtual Agent) for easier device onboarding, identification and troubleshooting across our portfolio of control products.
In 2021, we introduced QuickSet Widget, a family of connectivity modules integrated with QuickSet Cloud device management services, including a remote management dashboard and a mobile software development kit making it easy for OEMs across all channels to upgrade their products to be connected, managed and secured.
Our personnel are involved with various industry organizations and bodies, which are in the process of setting standards for IR and RF communication and networking in the home. Because of the nature of research and development ("R&D") activities, there can be no assurance that any of our R&D projects will be successfully completed or ultimately achieve commercial success.
Intellectual Property and Technology
A key factor in creating products and software for control of entertainment devices is our proprietary device knowledge graph. Since our founding in 1986, we have compiled an extensive device control library that includes nearly 13,000 brands comprising over 989,000 device models across AV and smart home platforms, supported by many common smart home protocols, including IR, HDMI-CEC, Zigbee (Rf4CE), Z-Wave, IP, as well as Home Network and Cloud Control.
We have developed a broad portfolio of patented technologies and the industry's leading database of device setup and control software. We ship integrated circuits, on which our software and control code libraries are embedded and that connect to our cloud services, directly to manufacturers for inclusion in their products. In addition, we license our software and technology to manufacturers. 
Our technology also includes other remote controlled home entertainment devices and home automation control modules, as well as wired Consumer Electronics Control ("CEC") and wireless IP control protocols commonly found on many of the latest HDMI and internet connected devices. Our proprietary software automatically detects, identifies and enables the appropriate control commands for many home entertainment and automation devices in the home. Our libraries are continuously updated with device control codes used in newly introduced AV and IoT devices. These control codes are captured directly from 
original control devices or from the manufacturers' written specifications to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the library. Our proprietary software and know-how permit us to offer a device control code database that is more robust and efficient than similarly priced products from our competitors.
This device knowledge graph is backed by our unique device fingerprinting technology which includes over 24.4 million unique device fingerprints across both AV and Smart Home devices.
Smart devices are becoming a more prevalent part of the home entertainment experience, and we offer several solutions to enable entertainment device control via smart phones, tablets, smart TVs, smart speakers or digital assistants. In our smart device control solutions, we offer the elements needed for device control ranging from IR and RF controller chips to IP-device control libraries to graphical and voice user interfaces, as well as artificial intelligence systems that deliver context aware device interactions. 
We hold a number of patents in the United States and abroad related to our products and technology and have filed domestic and foreign applications for other patents that are pending. At the end of 2021, we had more than 600 issued and pending United States patents related to remote control, home security, safety and automation as well as hundreds of foreign counterpart patents and applications in various territories around the world. Our patents have remaining lives ranging from one to 18 years. 
We have also obtained copyright registration and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and libraries of our device control codes. Additionally, the names of many of our products are registered, or are being registered, as trademarks in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in most of the other countries in which such products are sold. These registrations are valid for terms ranging up to 20 years and may be renewed as long as the trademarks continue to be used and are deemed by management to be important to our operations. While we follow the practice of obtaining patent, copyright and trademark registrations on new developments whenever advisable, in certain cases we have elected common law trade secret protection in lieu of obtaining such other protection.
Manufacturing and Supply
We currently operate vertically integrated manufacturing and assembly factories in the PRC, Mexico and Brazil, which allow us to produce in the regional markets and to scale our production to meet growing demand. We also use selected third-party manufacturers and suppliers in Asia. 
Our long-term factory planning strategy is to de-risk our reliance on a PRC-based supply chain by (1) reducing our manufacturing concentration in the PRC, (2) pursuing the lowest cost jurisdictions for manufacturing to ensure market competitive products and (3) offering customers a flexible and globally diverse manufacturing footprint to ensure a reliable and cost-efficient supply chain. To this effect, in 2022, we have leased factory space in Vietnam and expect to commence manufacturing operations in the third quarter of 2022.
Even though we operate three factories in the PRC, manufacturing and assembly plants in Mexico and Brazil, respectively, and plan to open a manufacturing facility in Vietnam in 2022, we continue to evaluate additional third-party manufacturers and sources of supply. During 2021, we utilized multiple third-party manufacturers and maintained duplicate tooling for certain of our products. Where possible we utilize standard parts and components, which are available from multiple sources. 
We are a large consumer of integrated circuits, including low-power, RF chips and modules that are used throughout our product portfolios. We continually seek additional sources to reduce our dependence on our integrated circuit suppliers. To further manage our integrated system on a chip supplier dependence, we include microcontroller technology which incorporates non-volatile, reprogrammable flash memory in most of our products. Flash memory-based microcontrollers have shorter lead times than microcontrollers using other memory technologies and may be reprogrammed. This allows us flexibility to use a given component on many different products, has the added benefit of potentially reducing excess and obsolete inventory exposure and allows us to update our product functionality in the field. This diversification lessens our dependence on any one supplier and allows us to negotiate more favorable terms. Qorvo International Pte Ltd. provided 11.8% and 14.2% of our total inventory purchases in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2019, no single supplier provided more than 10% of our total inventory purchases. 
Our manufacturing process consists of plastic injection, keypad molding, coating or painting, surface mounting of printed circuit boards, assembly, software installation, functional testing, and quality control. We conduct operations utilizing a formal, documented quality management system to ensure that our products and services satisfy customer needs and expectations. Our manufacturing facilities are certified to the ISO 9001:2015 International Standard for quality management. Testing and quality control are applied to components, parts, sub-assemblies, and systems obtained from third-party suppliers. Our manufacturing 
facilities in Mexico and in Yangzhou, PRC are also certified to the TL 9000 Standard, which is the telecom industry's unique extension to ISO 9001:2015. Our manufacturing facilities are certified to the ISO 14001:2015 International Standard for environmental management systems. In addition, our manufacturing facilities in Yangzhou, PRC have also achieved ISO 45001 International Standard for safety and health management systems, with one of the facilities successfully completing the Validated Audit Process with the Responsible Business Alliance ("RBA"). We are focused on reducing the impact of our operations on the environment; and our teams continue to examine practices and processes throughout our facilities to identify opportunities for greater efficiency. Each of our manufacturing facilities has standing policies and targets for the monitoring and management of waste generation and energy consumption, and continually strives for the reduction in electricity consumption, water usage and greenhouse gas emission. In particular, in response to the greater focus on combating climate change, each manufacturing facility has set targets for the year-over-year reduction of greenhouse emission and actively monitored its greenhouse emission throughout the year. 
We are an Affiliate Member of the RBA, the world's largest industry coalition dedicated to corporate social responsibility in global supply chains, and we are required to comply with RBA's rigorous Code of Conduct. Through the RBA program, we will assess our supply chain from tier 1 through tier 3 suppliers and request Validated Assessment Program audits for any identified high-risk suppliers. In addition to requiring observance to strict quality standards by our suppliers, we maintain and require our suppliers to adhere to a robust Global Supplier Code of Conduct and Fair Competition Policy ("Supplier Code of Conduct"), which is available on our website and is an essential part of our supply chain management. As part of the initial qualification and ongoing audit process, our dedicated Global Supplier Quality Management Team examines a supplier's social and environmental responsiveness in areas such as labor and human rights practice, occupational health and safety, and environmental protection.
Further, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets forth our global expectations that we have in the areas of fair dealing, legal compliance, business integrity, labor practices, health and safety, and environmental management. In particular, we require all within our supply chain to respect basic human rights and to not engage in any involuntary or forced labor and to fully comply with all laws and regulations pertaining to the appropriate and dignified treatment of all workers. In addition, we adhere to, and require those within our supply chain to adhere to the RBA Code of Conduct, which among other things prohibits the use of forced labor in any manner. To better enforce a zero-tolerance of forced labor, our employees, including but not limited to those within the Global Supplier Quality Management Team, have been trained to identify signs of forced labor and other unlawful labor practices and we continue to evaluate our global ESG compliance policies and procedures to ensure we have a global program that follows best-practices and adheres to changes in laws and regulations.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
Many of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing chemical substances in products, including laws regulating the manufacturing and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products. We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party damages or personal injury claims, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws. We also face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the material composition of our products.
We may also face significant costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation. The European Union's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("WEEE") makes producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. Our European subsidiaries are WEEE compliant. 
We believe that we have materially complied with all currently existing international and domestic federal, state and local statutes and regulations regarding environmental standards and occupational safety and health matters to which we are subject. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the costs incurred in complying with federal, state and local statutes and regulations pertaining to environmental standards and occupational safety and health laws and regulations did not materially affect our earnings, financial condition or competitive position. In addition, during the same period, the costs incurred in complying with other applicable government regulations likewise did not materially affect our earnings, financial condition or competitive position. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies, may give rise to additional compliance costs that may have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or financial condition.
Our operations, supply chain and our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and international treaties relating to climate change, such as climate disclosure, carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements. We strive to continually improve the energy and carbon efficiency of our operations, supply 
chain and product portfolio and deliver more cost-effective and lower carbon technology solutions to our customers. We believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements, and we are collaborating with our customers to find and promote ways that our technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance with related laws, regulations and treaties.
We are committed to reducing and eliminating substances of concern from our products and manufacturing process. Our products distributed in the European Union are compliant with the RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC) and REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) directives. In other regions, we also need to comply with our customers' specific requirements relating to the non-use of certain hazardous substances in the products, which are typically equally or more stringent than the RoHS directive. We have a dedicated "Green Team," based in the PRC and comprised of engineers, scientists and environmental regulation experts, that analyze our products, processes, and raw materials to ensure that we comply with environmental and government regulations worldwide. Additionally, we have in-house testing capability to ensure product compliance. In 2020, the Chinese government published four National Standards with the aim of reducing emission of certain volatile organic compounds ("VOC") in adhesives, coatings, ink and cleaning agents. Our Green Team has been working proactively for the identification and reduction of such VOCs within our supply chain. We place great importance in strict compliance of local health and safety laws and regulations. At our manufacturing facilities, we are also committed to protecting our workers from exposure to hazardous substances under an established health and safety management system; for example, we strive to have our facilities be free of lead and the substances banned by RoHS, and we are increasing our use of water-based paint at our facilities. 
We strive to extend the useful life of our products and reduce our products' impact on the environment, and we have invested significant R&D in improving the energy efficiency of our battery-operated products. For example, we deploy a low energy IR-engine in some of our products which can extend battery life regardless of the protocols utilized by the product. In 2021, we started shipping an Android TV remote product with a USB-C rechargeable battery to reduce battery consumption throughout the life of the product. We recently introduced our latest control platform and related technologies that address the growing demand for sustainable products that reduce energy use and eliminate waste. With this platform, we partnered with technology leaders and invested in bringing ultra-low power connectivity chips with built-in energy harvesting and photovoltaic cells to the market. These chips offer more computing power, while consuming up to 80% less battery power, enabling up to ten times longer battery life. We also offer a robust product refurbishment program to our customers where we reclaim, refurbish and recycle pre-owned remote controls. Under this program, substantially all of the materials in a pre-owned remote control unit are reused or recycled; for example, used plastics and silicon are ground and reused in other products. We have also employed new master carton packing methods to increase shipping efficiency and reduce cardboard usage. Some of our manufacturing facilities are switching to the use of recycled solder. To further reduce collateral waste, we have introduced an initiative to reduce and/or remove single use plastics ("SUP") from our supply chain and manufacturing process for certain customer programs.
Human Capital
At December 31, 2021, we employed 3,945 members of staff across our worldwide facilities. Of this staff, 2,850 are associated with our manufacturing and supply chain organizations in the PRC, Mexico and Brazil.

The respect for human rights is a core tenet both within our organization and when working with our supply chain members, and our employees are encouraged to notify the Company if they notice or suspect any violation of our employee Code of Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct or of law. We have a confidential ethics hotline to enable our employees to report any suspected violations of applicable laws or policies. In locations where we use third-party employment or labor agencies to source some members of our workforce, we have increased our audit and review efforts of such agencies to ensure that their practices are in line with our policies and priorities and they operate in compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct and the RBA Code of Conduct. 
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our top priority has been the health, safety, and well-being of our employees and their families, including those workers provided to us by third-party labor agencies. Our cross-functional COVID-19 steering committee meets regularly to review the latest data from business and site leaders, identify and address emerging risks, and formulate our response to actions taken by governments and public policy organizations. We have put in place policies and protocols based on guidance from public health leaders and regularly review and update them to reflect the best, most current information available. 
Labor unions represent approximately 43.9% of our 3,945 employees at December 31, 2021. Some of these unionized workers are employed in Monterrey, Mexico, and are represented under contract with the Sindicato Industrial de Trabajadores de Nuevo León adherido a la Federación Nacional de Sindicatos Independientes. Unionized workers, employed in Manaus, Brazil, are represented under contract with the Sindicato dos Trabalhadores nas Industrias Metalugicas, Mecanicas e de Materiais Eletricos de Manaus. Our business units are subject to various laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees. These laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business unit. We believe that our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good.
Seasonality
