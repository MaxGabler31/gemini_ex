Overview



Corporate Overview of NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation



We were originally incorporated as Original Source Entertainment, Inc. under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 20, 2009. Prior to the closing of the Acquisition, as defined below, we completed a series of steps contemplated by a Plan of Conversion pursuant to which we, among other things, changed our name to NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation, increased our authorized number of shares of Common Stock from 45,000,000 to 100,000,000, increased our authorized number of shares of preferred stock from 5,000,000 to 10,000,000 and reincorporated in Delaware. On July 20, 2017, we acquired NeuroOne, Inc. (the “Acquisition”). Immediately following the closing of the Acquisition, the business of NeuroOne, Inc. became our sole focus.



Corporate Overview and History of NeuroOne, Inc.



NeuroOne, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 7, 2016. Its predecessor entity, NeuroOne LLC (the “LLC”), was formed on December 13, 2013 and operated as a limited liability company until it was merged with and into NeuroOne, Inc. on October 27, 2016, with NeuroOne, Inc. as the surviving entity (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, all of the properties, rights, privileges and powers of the LLC vested in NeuroOne, Inc., and all debts, liabilities and duties of the LLC became the debts, liabilities and duties of NeuroOne, Inc., except for the Exclusive Start-up Company License Agreement, dated as of October 1, 2014, as amended on February 22, 2017, March 30, 2019 and September 18, 2019 (the “Original WARF License”), with the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (“WARF”), which was not legally transferred until May 2017. The purposes of the Merger were to: change the jurisdiction of incorporation from Minnesota to Delaware; change the ownership of the LLC’s underlying assets; and convert from a limited liability company to a corporation. In December 2019, NeuroOne, Inc. was merged with and into the Company, with the Company remaining as the surviving entity.



We are a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of thin film electrode technology for continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) and stereoelectrocencephalography (sEEG) recording, spinal cord stimulation, brain stimulation and ablation solutions for patients suffering from epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, essential tremors, chronic pain due to failed back surgeries and other related neurological disorders. Additionally, we are investigating the potential applications of our technology associated with artificial intelligence. Members of our management team have held senior leadership positions at a number of medical technology and biopharmaceutical companies, including Boston Scientific, St. Jude Medical, Stryker Instruments, C.R. Bard, A-Med Systems, Sunshine Heart, Empi, Don-Joy and PMT.



We are developing our cortical, sheet and depth electrode technology to provide solutions for diagnosis through cEEG recording and sEEG recording and treatment through brain stimulation and ablation, all in one product. A cEEG is a continuous recording of the electrical activity of the brain that identifies the location of irregular brain activity, which information is required for proper treatment. cEEG recording involves an invasive surgical procedure, referred to as a craniotomy. sEEG involves a less invasive procedure whereby doctors place electrodes in targeted brain areas by drilling small holes through the skull. Both methods of seizure diagnosis are used to identify areas of the brain where epileptic seizures originate in order to precisely locate the seizure source for therapeutic treatment if possible.



Deep brain stimulation, or DBS, therapies involve activating or inhibiting the brain with electricity that can be given directly by electrodes on the surface or implanted deeper in the brain via depth electrodes. Introduced in 1987, this procedure involves implanting a power source referred to as a neurostimulator, which sends electrical impulses through implanted depth electrodes, to specific targets in the brain for the treatment of disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, essential tremors, dystonia, and chronic pain. The effects of DBS as a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s is also being evaluated by researchers. Unlike ablative technologies, the effects of DBS are reversible.

RF ablation is a procedure that uses radiofrequency under the electrode contacts which is directed to the site of the brain tissue that is targeted for removal. The process involves delivering energy to the contacts, thereby heating them and destroying the brain tissue. The ablation does not remove the tissue. Rather, it is left in place and typically scar tissue forms in the place where the ablation occurs. This procedure is also known as brain lesioning as it causes irreversible lesions. In August 2021, the Company announced a strategic partnership with RBC Medical Innovations to develop a radio frequency (RF) ablation generator. The following month, our RF ablation technology was tested by representatives from Emory University in Atlanta Georgia in an animal study. The product remains in development.



Our cortical sheet electrode and depth electrode technology has been tested over the years by both WARF, the owners of our licensed patents, and Mayo Clinic located in Rochester, Minnesota, in both pre-clinical models as well as through an institutional review board (“IRB”) approval at Mayo Clinic for clinical research. In December 2020, we announced the first human commercial use of our Evo cortical electrode in a procedure performed at the Mayo Clinic. Regarding our ablation electrode, the Cleveland Clinic has performed testing in bench top models and pre-clinical (or animal testing) modes. These pre-clinical tests have demonstrated that the technology is capable of recording, ablation and acute stimulation, although our ablation electrode technology remains in product development (meaning that additional testing will be needed prior to it being cleared for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”)) for recording (or diagnostic) and therapeutic modalities.



We received 510(k) FDA clearance for our Evo cortical technology in November 2019, and in September 2021 we received FDA clearance to market our Evo sEEG electrode technology for temporary (less than 24 hours) use with recording, monitoring, and stimulation equipment for the recording, monitoring, and stimulation of electrical signals at the subsurface level of the brain.



Our Market Opportunity



Epilepsy Market



We expect to initially target the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. Epilepsy can be caused by a variety of conditions that affect a person’s brain, some of which are: stroke, brain tumor, traumatic brain injury and central nervous system infections. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”) and Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy (“CURE”), there are approximately 3,000,000 patients annually suffering with epilepsy in the United States, with an additional 200,000 diagnosed every year. The CDC and CURE also estimate that epilepsy costs the United States $15.5 billion per year. Approximately 720,000 of these patients are not receptive to pharmaceutical treatment and therefore are appropriate for surgical treatment of this disorder. In addition to poor quality of life, epilepsy also is associated with fairly high mortality rates. Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy has an annual incidence of 1.16/1000 in epilepsy patients. Despite the large market opportunity, it is estimated that there are only 16,000 craniotomies performed for epilepsy cases each year in the United States with 18,000 performed in Europe.1 These numbers represent an underpenetrated market due to the invasiveness of a full craniotomy required just to perform the diagnostic procedure. After the diagnostic procedure, a second therapeutic procedure is required and at times even a third surgery if the seizures persist. We believe patients are unwilling to proceed due to the long diagnostic times (one to four weeks in the hospital with a craniotomy), infection rates and 50% rate of success in the diagnosis and treatment of the disorder. As detailed above, after the diagnosis is completed, if successful, the patient must undergo an additional procedure to have the affected area of brain tissue removed. The average cost for the diagnostic technology per procedure is $10,000, with ablation devices costing $15,000 and brain stimulation devices costing $25,000 to $30,000. We believe our technology, once developed, will offer an all-in-one solution with diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities.

Many leading neurologists believe that the limits of today’s current technologies are the reason the exact affected area of the brain causing epileptic seizures is not well-determined. We believe our technology, which has been developed to date by physicians at WARF and Mayo Clinic, will provide a number of advantages over the current commercially available technologies, including the following:




● | Our proprietary thin film technology under development has a smaller footprint with many more electrodes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We expect that our technology will eventually be able to be implanted using a minimally invasive procedure utilizing a dime sized burr hole rather than a full craniotomy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our technology may provide more accurate detection of irregular brain activity over currently available technology. In limited clinical testing, doctors at Mayo Clinic have documented pre-seizure activity (micro-seizures) during their clinical research with their patients using our cEEG technology.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We expect our technology can ablate through the electrodes as well as perform brain stimulation, allowing for diagnosis and treatment through the same product and in the same procedure.



Parkinson’s Disease



The Parkinson’s Disease Foundation estimates that as many as 1,000,000 patients in the United States live with Parkinson’s disease with an additional 60,000 patients diagnosed per year. Over 10,000,000 patients worldwide are living with Parkinson’s disease. There have not been any drugs introduced that have been effective at treating Parkinson’s disease. The average onset is over 60 years old but some people have been diagnosed as young as 40 years old. Parkinson’s is a disorder of the central nervous system caused by loss of brain cells throughout various regions of the brain. It is attributed to the loss of dopamine production in the brain, a messenger in the brain that allows for movement and coordination. There are no objective tests to diagnose Parkinson’s disease, and misdiagnosis rates are still very high. Doctors look to find two or more signs to make a diagnosis, including balance problems, rigidity and tremors that occur during rest. In 2011, the FDA approved the first imaging device called a DaTscan that can capture images of the dopamine system in the brain. By itself, these scans cannot diagnose Parkinson’s but can help confirm a doctor’s diagnosis. Parkinson’s disease is typically not fatal; however, complications caused by the symptoms of Parkinson’s, such as difficulty swallowing causing food to travel to the lungs resulting in pulmonary issues or falls related to loss of balance, can be fatal.



Today’s primary treatment for Parkinson’s disease involves medications that have not proven to resolve symptoms but rather ease symptoms. Years ago, surgical procedures such as thalamotomy and pallidotomy targeted certain parts of the brain and involved destroying the tissue. More recently, these procedures have been replaced with DBS. A doctor evaluates the patient by reviewing the patient’s symptoms and medications taken and administering detailed memory, thinking and imaging tests to determine if they are appropriate for DBS. According to the Michael J. Fox Parkinson’s Disease Research Foundation website, patients that seem to do best with DBS are those that have had the disease for at least four years and have benefited from taking medications prescribed to control the disease. In addition, DBS seems to help with reducing the issues with motor functions such as tremors, stiffness and slowness but not for balance issues. Doctors are evaluating treatment to other parts of the brain in an effort to address more symptoms to treat walking or balance issues. In addition, research is being conducted to provide stimulation when the symptoms return as opposed to all of the time.

Essential Tremors



Essential tremors are thought to be due to electrical irregularities in the brain that send abnormal signals to the muscles. It is a progressive condition that worsens over time and is linked to genetic disorders that typically appear in people who are over 40. Essential tremors usually occur alone and without any other neurological symptoms or signs. The tremors usually occur when the hands are raised and primarily affect the hands. Muscles in the trunk, face and neck may also experience symptoms. Sometimes misdiagnosed as Parkinson’s disease, essential tremors are an involuntary rhythmic shaking of the hands that is not present at rest. It is apparent during activities such as drinking, writing and eating. Symptoms can worsen due to stress, anxiety, smoking, caffeine, fatigue, etc. Genetics Home Reference estimates that as many as 10,000,000 people in the United States are affected by the disease. Treatments for the disease include medical therapy, weighting the limbs and DBS. Patients need to eliminate any medications they are taking that cause tremors as this can exacerbate the symptoms. For some patients, using wrist weights may ease symptoms allowing the patient to function. Other patients may also use relaxation techniques as stress can increase symptoms. Medical therapy is also used to treat patients’ symptoms. Primidone is typically the first drug prescribed as it has had success in some situations for epilepsy. Botox is also used at times to control head tremors. When these fail, surgery is the next alternative. A surgical procedure used years ago created lesions in the ventral intermediate thalamus and was highly successful with treating essential tremors but is no longer commonly used due to increased risk of developing speech problems. The latest therapy is DBS, which, unlike other therapies, is reversible and programmable, helping to adjust the settings to maximize patient benefit. Similar to Parkinson’s disease, the ability to detect this irregular brain activity before it causes a tremor is highly desirable.
Dystonia



Dystonia is a neurological condition recognized as a motion disorder that involves over activity of a variety of different muscles simultaneously that work against each other. It presents itself in a variety of symptoms but typically involves repetitive, patterned and often twisting involuntary muscle contractions resembling tremors. According to the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation, over 300,000 people are affected in the United States and Canada alone. Dystonia is the third most common problem seen in movement disorder clinics. Because it has many different manifestations, it is often misdiagnosed. In addition, similar to Parkinson’s disease, there are no specific tests that can positively diagnose dystonia. A doctor typically will evaluate patient and family history, potentially do genetic testing, EEG testing, blood and urine tests. There are also many treatment options for patients but depend on the type of dystonia. Botox and certain medications may be helpful or DBS may be used.
Spinal Cord Stimulation



Failed back surgery syndrome (“FBSS”) is a condition that produces chronic lower back/leg pain due to one or more failed back surgeries. Typically, it is related to patients that suffer with pain after surgery of the lumbar spine for degenerative disc disease. Re-operations are usually not recommended for these patients due to low success rates. These patients experience greater levels of pain, a lower quality of life, varying levels of disability and higher rate of unemployment. Spinal cord stimulation works by placing an electrode(s) in a targeted area of the spine which is then connected to an implantable pulse generator that sends electrical stimulation to the electrode to block the pain signals from reaching the brain.



The back pain market includes the following indications: FBSS, Ischemic Limb Pain, and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. Over half of this market is comprised of patients with FBSS. Certain studies have indicated a benefit for these patients suffering from chronic back and lower limb pain when they have been treated with electrical stimulation. Prior to the patient receiving an implant, they undergo a trial period that allows them to determine if they are receiving relief from the therapy while preventing a surgery to implant the pulse generator that provides the stimulation. If the trial period is successful, then the device is implanted in a follow-up procedure.

Artificial Intelligence



The brain consists of approximately 100 billion nerve cells, which are small wires that pass electrical signals to control all of its functions. There have been a number of successful clinical trials in which small metal wires, known as electrodes, are implanted in the brain to correct nerve damage using wireless communication between implanted wires to simulate functional nerve cells. In addition to correcting damaged nerve cells, certain scientists have theorized that if millions of wires could be implanted in the brain, these electrodes could present an opportunity to use artificial intelligence to create infrared sight, increase hearing or perfect memory recall. However, there currently is no commercially available manufacturing platform capable of making thousands of wires that can be placed within or on the brain and work reliably for the lifetime of a subject, and are soft enough to match the tissue of the brain, that avoid damage to the brain.
Limitations of Currently Available Therapies



There are a limited number of currently available products for diagnosis and treatment for people with neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Although the currently available systems provide diagnosis and treatment for patients, they have certain inherent limitations and shortcomings that we believe limit their use and validate the need for improved technology in the market. These limitations include:

● | Lengthy diagnostic times: Patients spend one to four weeks in the hospital waiting to have seizures that will allow doctors to determine where the seizures are occurring.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lower Accuracy: Historically, clinical electrode manufacturers primarily provided electrodes that sample brain tissue at approximately centimeter spatial scales. Advances in digital EEG acquisition have made recordings at sub-millimeter spatial scales possible, but high-spatial resolution EEG has been slow to impact clinical practice. Existing, higher spatial scales increase the potential for missing data that may be critical in the removal of brain tissue causing the irregular activity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Need to perform a full craniotomy (invasiveness): Currently available cortical electrode technology is placed through a craniotomy, which requires removing the top part of the cranium and is a very painful and invasive procedure. Procedural times for a craniotomy range from a minimum of four to eight hours. A variety of complications can occur when a full craniotomy is performed, including but not limited to: stroke, bleeding, infection, seizures, swelling of the brain (which may require a second craniotomy), nerve damage, which may cause muscle paralysis or weakness, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, which may require repair, loss of mental functions and permanent brain damage with associated disabilities. The invasiveness, procedural times and possible surgical complications have limited the growth of surgical treatment of epilepsy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Requirement for a surgical incision: Currently, when patients have been implanted with paddle electrodes in the spinal area, a surgical incision has been required. A technology that allows for percutaneous placement is desirable.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Limited number of contacts on an electrode: Paddle electrodes currently are available in a variety of sizes and number of contacts. Physicians want to explore adding a greater number of contacts on the same electrode in order to be able to be more precise in stimulating targeted areas.

Our Solution



As a result of the inherent limitations and inconvenience of existing systems, we believe that there is a significant unmet need among people with neurological disorders for cortical strip, grid and depth electrodes that provide diagnostic capabilities through cEEG and sEEG recording in addition to therapeutic modalities, such as brain stimulation and ablation, offered as an all-in-one product. In comparison to currently available technologies, we are continuing to develop applications of our strip, grid and depth electrodes with the goal of providing the following expected advantages:

● | Reduced time for diagnosis: If we are successful in identifying brain activity more quickly, in offering a minimally invasive procedure and developing an all-in-one solution, we expect our technology will reduce overall procedural times. While our pre-clinical and clinical experience to date is limited, our cortical grid technology has demonstrated the ability to provide high fidelity recordings that have allowed physicians to identify the affected brain tissue causing seizures in hours versus weeks. This represents the potential for meaningful cost savings for hospitals and patients and improved quality of life for patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improved accuracy of diagnostic technologies: Because we believe our thin film technology is capable of recording at higher fidelity than current technologies used in EEG recording, we believe our technology may be able to more precisely determine the brain tissue causing seizures. In December 2020, we announced the first human commercial use of our Evo cortical electrode to perform recording, functional mapping, monitoring and stimulation of the brain. In the procedure, performed at the Mayo Clinic, our electrodes were used to record evidence of pre-seizure activity, which may be critical in developing treatments to prevent the onset of seizures. We believe our technology may be able to improve outcomes compared to using other diagnostic technologies regardless of whether we are able to offer an all in one diagnostic and therapeutic solution.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Implantation via minimally invasive procedure with fewer post-procedure complications: We are currently developing an approach to deliver the cortical electrodes, including minimizing the invasiveness of the procedure. We expect that patients who have qualified for this therapy will be more accepting of a minimally-invasive procedure. Such a procedure would potentially reduce the patient’s pain, bleeding and other adverse events associated with a full craniotomy. Our technology is expected to also have fewer wires, also referred to as tails, exiting the patient’s head, which can also reduce the potential for infections. Furthermore, the material we currently use in our cortical electrodes has shown in pre-clinical evaluations to cause less inflammation than current electrode substrates as it appears more compatible with brain tissue. As discussed under “Our Strategy” below, our technology has been and will be implanted via a full craniotomy until such time, if ever, as we are able to develop our minimally invasive procedure.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | All-in-one diagnostic and therapeutic technology solution: Due to the expected high fidelity recording capabilities of our technology under development, we have received feedback from physicians that they will attempt to perform the diagnosis and treatment in a single procedure, thereby eliminating the need for a second surgical procedure, reducing the likelihood of patient infection, risks associated with surgical procedures and minimizing the diagnostic, procedural and hospital costs. As discussed under “Our Strategy” below, our initial product offering offers diagnostic-only capabilities while we advance the development of our all-in-one approach. Currently, we are developing a combination recording, stimulation and RF ablation technology that will perform both diagnostic and therapeutic functions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Percutaneous placement of spinal cord stimulation paddle electrodes with scalability options: Due to the thin film nature of our electrode technology, we believe that it may allow for percutaneous placement, thereby preventing the need to make surgical incisions to place the electrodes. Minimally invasive and percutaneously placed technologies have become almost a requirement for adoption with patients and physicians. In addition, our technology offers the ability to increase the number of contacts on a film that traditionally offers fewer contacts. Increasing the number of contacts may allow for more precise stimulation in the spine, potentially improving the therapeutic outcomes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy



Our goal is to be the global leader in cEEG and sEEG recording, monitoring, deep brain stimulation and ablation, owning the procedure from diagnosis through treatment. The key elements of our strategy include:

● | Introduce cortical strip and grid electrodes for the diagnosis of epilepsy in United States: In December 2019, we announced that we received FDA 510(k) clearance to market our thin film cortical electrode technology for temporary (less than 30 days) recording, monitoring, and stimulation on the surface of the brain. Our initial product offering has initially been and will be placed through traditional surgical means involving a craniotomy until such time, if any, that we launch our minimally invasive procedure. In July 2020, we entered into a development relationship with Zimmer, pursuant to which we granted Zimmer exclusive global rights to distribute the cortical strip and grid electrodes, and Zimmer will use commercially reasonable efforts to promote, market and sell the strip and grid electrodes. We believe, due to physician feedback, that our technology represents a major improvement over existing cortical electrodes for the recording of brain activity. We are initially targeting epilepsy as we believe this is a clinical area of great need and a market that is underserved with a quick path to commercialization. We believe the largest and quickest-to-market geography for our cortical strip and grid technology under development is the United States for a number of reasons, including the following: (i) many industry sources believe there is a large underserved U.S. market, (ii) healthy procedural reimbursement exist for centers and physicians, (iii) average selling prices are robust, and (iv) there is substantial physician enthusiasm for our technology under development.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Launch depth electrodes for sEEG recording: In September 2021, we announced that we received FDA 510(k) clearance to market our Evo sEEG electrode technology for temporary (less than 24 hours) use with recording, monitoring, and stimulation equipment for recording, monitoring, and stimulation of electrical signals at the subsurface level of the brain. We filed for 510(k) clearance to expand the duration of use up to less than 30 days in November 2021. This submission is pending FDA review. Given the reluctance of patients to undergo epilepsy surgery due to its invasiveness, a number of epilepsy centers have adopted the use of depth electrodes, which are placed by drilling small holes into the patient’s cranium, thereby avoiding a craniotomy. We believe our technology offers advantages compared to current depth electrode technology and will enable us to offer a therapeutic solution using this technology in the future. As we continue to develop our technology, we plan to release further information about the expected advantages of our technology over currently available therapies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Utilize these core technologies to develop all-in-one diagnostic and therapeutic solutions with the initial focus on a combination diagnostic and ablation electrode: Patients currently undergo one surgical procedure for diagnosis (either to have a cortical electrode placed via a craniotomy or depth electrodes placed via holes drilled into the skull) and, hopefully after the brain recordings successfully indicate where the affected brain tissue is located, a second procedure or surgery is then required to treat the patient. There is strong physician interest in being able to perform both the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure concurrently. We are developing our technology with the goal of being able to offer this benefit although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. We are pursuing cortical grid, strip and depth electrode technology that can record brain activity (diagnose) and also provide both acute and long term stimulation as well as depth electrode technology that can ablate brain tissue. The technology has demonstrated these functions in acute and short term animal models; however, additional development is required to offer a device that has long term therapeutic application. These therapeutic technologies are expected to require more robust regulatory approvals for the United States, ranging from a 510(k) to pre-market approvals (“PMAs”) with human clinical data. We will engage the FDA at the proper time to determine the most efficient regulatory path.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Develop percutaneous placed electrodes for spinal cord stimulation with scalable contact configurations: Given that many surgically placed technologies have become less invasive due to patient and physician demands, we believe that our flexible thin film technology will allow for percutaneous placement, thus potentially eliminating the need to make a surgical incision. By leveraging our existing FDA cleared cortical electrode and sEEG technology, we may be able to offer the ability to improve precision of where the stimulation is delivered. NeuroOne’s platform thin film technology has the capability to increase the number of contacts in a similar footprint that has fewer contacts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Gain approval for other brain or motor related disorders such as Parkinson’s with the therapeutic technologies developed for epilepsy: While we are developing our technology for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy, we believe that our technology has strong application and utilization for other brain or motor related disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, essential tremors and facial pain as these diseases are currently treated with DBS if medications are not effective. As previously mentioned, we are planning to offer electrodes that can be implanted for long term stimulation applications, but such use will require that we pursue additional approvals from the FDA and any international regulatory bodies where we seek to commercialize our technology.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Explore partnerships with other companies that leverage our core technology: Given that our technology enables, complements and/or competes with a number of companies that are in the market or attempting to enter the market with diagnostic or therapeutic technologies to treat brain related disorders, we believe there may be opportunities to establish mutually beneficial relationships. In addition, our technology may have application in cardiovascular, orthopedic and pain related indications that could benefit from a high fidelity thin film electrode product that can provide stimulation and/or ablation therapies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Investigate the potential applications associated with Artificial Intelligence: We have been informed by some of our corporate advisors that the ability to offer scale-able electrode technology that can provide thousands of electrodes in the brain may be helpful in treating medical conditions that may benefit from using artificial intelligence. The Company has formed an advisory board that will provide guidance to the Company as we continue to explore the opportunities in this exciting field.

Our Technology



Epilepsy Mapping and Monitoring



Epileptic seizures occur when the neurons in the brain miscommunicate. This miscommunication typically results in involuntary muscle seizure activities and/or periods of perceptual disconnect where the individual appears frozen. Modern medical science has advanced the treatment of epileptic seizures by mapping the electrical communication activity of neurons and understanding their special orientation in the brain. This mapping is accomplished by access to the cranium (through a craniotomy) and placing conductive contacts on the brain directly. The craniotomy procedure is very invasive, traumatic to the surrounding tissue, results in high patient down time, and increases the risk of infection.

We seek to leverage scale-able technology and produce ultra-thin, or paper-thin electrodes that allow for high-resolution and high-definition recordings, which would improve mapping resolution and signal acquisition. If the Company is able to leverage scale-able technology, it would mean that our technology would be able to incorporate smaller electrodes and thereby increase the number of electrodes on a given surface area. We expect that this would increase the imaging resolution so that brain activity is displayed in greater definition. We also believe that the electrodes’ unique thinness and flexibility will provide a less invasive approach to electrode placement. The electrodes would be able to be placed through a small quarter size hole instead of by an invasive full craniotomy procedure.







The images under “Cortical Electrode,” from bottom to top, are images of our cortical electrode strip, our grid electrode, and the placement of the grid electrode on the brain, respectively. The images under “High Density Interconnect” are both images of our product that connects our electrodes to the head box, which is a piece of hardware that connects to electrodes to acquire, amplify, display, store and archive electrophysiological signals, and is integrated as part of our manufactured electrode product. The images under “Head Box” and “Signal Monitoring and Mapping” are images of the device which processes information received through the high density interconnect, and a sample output of data acquisition, respectively, neither of which is one of the Company’s products.



Our technology consists of three primary types of cortical electrodes: grid electrodes, strip electrodes and dual-sided electrodes. These electrodes have a patented design that utilizes proprietary processing and materials technology, which we believe will allow the electrodes to have improved features over the current industry standard recording electrodes.



What sets our technology apart from others is the integration of state of the art design leveraging the latest in flexible printed circuit technology. We believe our patented designs will provide the surgeon a higher tactile perspective on electrode placement allowing for ultra-precise neuron recording. We expect the benefits of our electrode designs to include the ability to detect better defined margins between healthy tissue and resect-able tissue, less immune-response from the brain and surrounding tissue, better signal acquisition due to superior conformability of the electrode over the brain, improved flexibility that physicians have requested, which we expect will enable a minimally invasive approach and the electrodes unique thinness that is unmatched by current products being used.



The Future of Neurology Mapping with NeuroOne



We seek to develop superior “scale-able” technology for future product system iterations in higher density contact placement. This will open the doors to other brain related disease recording procedures by providing high fidelity, more accurate diagnostic capabilities and also the ability to provide an all-in-one therapy capable of diagnosis, ablation and/or stimulation. Beyond the brain, we believe our technology under development has applications in other neurological signal recording disease states related to voluntary or involuntary motor neuron abnormalities, understanding sensory neuro behavior (pain), limb prosthetics and degenerative muscle disease.

Clinical Development and Regulatory Pathway



Clinical Experience, Future Development and Clinical Trial Plans



Our Evo cortical electrode technology has received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for recording, monitoring, and stimulating brain tissue for up to 30 days. Our Evo sEEG electrode technology has received FDA 510(k) clearance from the FDA for use (less than 24 hours) with recording, monitoring, and stimulation equipment for the recording, monitoring, and stimulation of electrical signals at the subsurface level of the brain. Our other products have not received any clearance for commercialization by any U.S. or foreign regulatory body. To date, the Company has performed a number of bench top (which includes feasibility testing) and pre-clinical tests (which include animal testing of device placement, ergonomics, performance, ease of use, and other tests required by FDA regulations). As described in “—Government Regulation” below, the Company will be required to perform additional testing of its technology in connection with seeking additional regulatory clearances or approvals.



We intend to expand our product offerings to include less invasive means and all-in-one solutions, thus providing both patients and physicians better options to treat epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, essential tremors, chronic pain due to failed back surgeries and other related neurological disorders. While we expect to make modifications to our initial system, we believe that most of our future product development initiatives will involve unique and transformational next generation technology that should drive further appeal of our products with both physicians and patients.



We are utilizing a number of resources to develop these technologies. We license three critical patents from WARF that are the foundation of the technology and we are developing and intend to commercialize and benefit from the thin film technology know-how of Mayo Clinic doctors through our license and development agreement. WARF, Mayo Clinic (cortical electrodes) and Cleveland Clinic (sEEG electrodes) have been responsible for all pre-clinical studies of our technology under development to date. See “—WARF License” and “—Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research License and Development Agreement” below. Further, as we announced in December 2020, Mayo Clinic doctors used our technology in the first human commercial application of our Evo cortical electrode technology to perform recording, functional mapping and stimulation of the brain on a human patient.



Below we have summarized, for each component of our technology, the current stage of development or commercial production, the pre-clinical testing done to date by WARF, the Cleveland Clinic or Mayo Clinic on such component, if any, our plans for further testing or clinical trials and our expectations regarding the requirements for regulatory clearance or approval and timing of regulatory submissions.




Technology | Stage of Development and Pre-Clinical Testing to Date | Additional Expected Steps for Regulatory Clearance or Approval 
-----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cortical strip and grid electrodes for the diagnosis of epilepsy | The Company has finalized the design for the product and there are no further expected changes to the device (“design freeze”). Pre-clinical testing and clinical testing on the final design has been conducted by Mayo Clinic and WARF (as described in “Mayo Clinic Studies” below). The product is in commercial production. | The Company received FDA 510(k) clearance in the fourth calendar quarter of 2019. Commercial launch commenced utilizing Zimmer, our distribution partner. 
Depth electrodes for recording (diagnostic) purposes | We have frozen this design and the product is in commercial production. No clinical testing was required in order to obtain FDA clearance. | The Company filed for FDA 510(k) marketing clearance for sEEG electrodes in May 2021 and received a 510(k) clearance from FDA for recording, monitoring and stimulation of brain tissue for less than 24 hours in September 2021. The Company filed for 510(k) clearance to expand the duration of use up to less than 30 days in November 2021. This submission is pending FDA review. Zimmer has indicated its desire to distribute this product once we receive FDA 510(k) clearance to market for less than 30 days use and has placed initial stocking orders.

Depth electrode diagnostic and ablation devices | No design freeze. Pre-clinical testing, including benchtop and animal testing, has been conducted on early designs. Additional pre-clinical testing at the Cleveland Clinic was completed in the second calendar quarter of 2020. Pre-clinical (animal) testing was conducted in September 2021 with representatives from Emory University in Atlanta Georgia. The Company announced a partnership with RBC Medical Systems in August 2021 to develop an RF generator that will be used with the Company’s diagnostic and ablation electrode. No clinical testing planned prior to FDA clearance because predicates did not perform clinical testing. | Once the design is finalized, we will be required to conduct additional pre-clinical testing, which may include additional benchtop or animal testing for safety and performance. We are planning a Pre-Submission (Q-Sub) to the FDA for the RF Ablation System, to review the feasibility of “Breakthrough” designation and to complete animal studies in the first calendar quarter of 2022. We anticipate filing a 510(k) submission in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022. We expect that we will need to demonstrate design verification, which we estimate will cost us $200,000 to complete, biocompatibility, which we estimate will require an investment of $100,000 to complete, and sterilization validation and adoption, which we estimate will require $25,000 to complete. We may also need to demonstrate electrical safety, which we estimate will cost us $60,000. It is estimated the RF generator will cost approximately $1.5 million to complete. Future testing requirements for regulatory clearance will continue to be evaluated as we develop the design and regulatory strategy for this product.

Spinal cord stim electrodes | No design freeze. We performed pre-clinical in-house bench top testing in August 2020 and are currently performing bench top testing at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In June 2021 we started bench top testing of prototypes to demonstrate chronic performance and longevity. | This device is in early stages of development. Once the design is finalized, we will be required to conduct additional pre-clinical testing, which may include additional benchtop or animal testing for safety and performance. Additionally, the FDA may require that we conduct human clinical studies. No FDA feedback has been sought or received by us to date on the regulatory/clinical process that may be required for spinal cord stimulation indication, but we expect regulatory PMA approval will require a more robust clinical process, human clinical data for a PMA (implanted system), depending on proposed indications for use. Future pre-clinical and clinical testing requirements for regulatory submission will continue to be evaluated as we develop the design of this product. 
--------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Depth electrode chronic stimulation devices | No design freeze. Bench top testing remains in progress and we expect to announce results of these studies in the first quarter of 2022. While this device remains in early development, we began conducting bench top durability testing in the second calendar quarter of 2021 and expect to announce results in the first quarter of 2022. | Following a design freeze, we will be required to conduct additional pre-clinical testing, which may include additional benchtop or animal testing for safety and performance. Additionally, FDA-approved human clinical studies will most likely be required. No FDA feedback has been sought or received by us to date on the clinical process that will be required for chronic stimulation, but we expect regulatory approval for chronic stimulation may require a more robust clinical process, which could a PMA with human clinical data. Because we have not yet met with the FDA, we cannot yet determine what clinical data and testing we will need to complete or what the testing will need to demonstrate. However, we believe, based on the experience of competitors for similar technology, that we will need to conduct clinical trials, which we estimate will require an investment of approximately $2,000,000, as well as demonstrate biocompatibility, which we estimate will cost $150,000 to complete, and demonstrate sterilization validation and adoption, which we estimate will cost $35,000 to complete.

Mayo Clinic and University of Wisconsin-Madison Studies



Our cortical technology for the diagnosis of epilepsy has been tested by doctors at Mayo Clinic in multiple pre-clinical tests conducted from 2012 to 2017. In pre-clinical models, doctors examined the biological impact on mammalian brains. Polyimide substrate electrodes (NeuroOne technology) were implanted on the pig’s brain for one week alongside standard competitive electrodes. The tissue underneath the two types of electrodes was removed, fixed, stained, and examined for immunological responses. The results of a histological (evaluation of brain tissue under a microscope) analysis showed reduced immunological reaction to prolonged polyimide substrate implants (NeuroOne technology) compared to standard silicone substrate clinical electrodes. Electrophysiological recordings showed data obtained from polyimide electrodes which showed the feasibility of high fidelity multi-scale electrophysiology while also displaying easier deployment of polyimide electrodes (NeuroOne technology) through minimally invasive burr holes.



Additionally, doctors implanted our polyimide thin film electrodes on five human patients who were undergoing surgery to remove brain tissue for drug resistant epilepsy. Electrophysiological recordings from the polyimide thin film technology displayed in each of these patients demonstrated micro-seizure activity due to the high fidelity multi-scale electrophysiology. In December 2020, we announced the first human commercial use of our Evo cortical electrode to perform recording, functional mapping and stimulation of the brain. In the procedure, performed at the Mayo Clinic, our electrodes were used to record evidence of pre-seizure activity which may be critical in developing treatments to prevent the onset of seizures.



Conclusions reached by the physicians at Mayo Clinic were that thin, flexible polyimide electrodes (NeuroOne technology) provided recordings similar to standard clinical electrodes with reduced immunological response. In addition, Mayo Clinic physicians observed that the flexibility of polyimide electrodes may reduce pain and swelling associated with implantation of the device, and the single wire exiting the skull may reduce infection risk. The ability to record micro-seizure and single neuron brain activity may also provide additional useful clinical data. Combined, these properties suggest that the replacement of current competitive silicone electrodes with polyimide substrate electrodes (NeuroOne technology) for recording brain activity for epilepsy could provide enhanced clinical value with reduced cost, reduced infection risk, and improved patient comfort.



In addition, our thin film cortical implant technology has been tested by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in multiple pre-clinical animal studies conducted from 2006 to 2016, which included mice, rats and primates. In these studies, our technology was able to record brain activity from different areas of the brain, was implanted in a minimally invasive fashion, electrically provided brain stimulation and tissue ablation, and had increased flexibility compared to existing commercially available technology, which allowed the grids to conform more easily to the brain surface (and may have reduced pain and swelling, compared to less flexible devices).



Sales and Marketing



Zimmer Development Agreement 



Based on the size and maturity of the U.S. market, our initial commercial focus, on July 20, 2020, we entered into an exclusive development and distribution agreement (the “Development Agreement”) with Zimmer, pursuant to which we granted Zimmer exclusive global rights to distribute NeuroOne’s strip and grid cortical electrodes (the “Strip/Grid Products”) and electrode cable assembly products (the “Electrode Cable Assembly Products”), including to approximately 188 Level 4 epilepsy centers. Additionally, we granted Zimmer the exclusive right and license to distribute certain depth electrodes developed by the Company (“SEEG Products”, and together with the Strip/Grid Products and Electrode Cable Assembly Products, the “Products”). The parties have agreed to collaborate with respect to development activities under the Development Agreement through a joint development committee composed of an equal number of representatives of Zimmer and the Company.

For more information regarding the Development Agreement, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Overview—Collaborations Revenue” and “Note 7 – Zimmer Development Agreement” included in “Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Report.



Reimbursement



Coverage in the United States



Reimbursement from private third-party healthcare payors and, to a lesser extent, Medicare will be an important element of our success. Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and third-party payors have adopted coverage policies for our targeted indications, there is no guarantee this will continue at the same levels or at all in the future. Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, is a medical code set that is used to report medical, surgical and diagnostic procedures and services to entities such as physicians, health insurance companies and accreditation organizations.



Applicable diagnostic CPT codes for mapping (diagnosing) the brain for diagnostic procedures are as follows:




● | 61531 Subdural implantation of strip electrodes through one or more burr or trephine (saw) hole(s) for long-term seizure monitoring;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 61533 Craniotomy with elevation of bone flap: for subdural implantation of an electrode array, for long term seizure monitoring;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 61535 Craniotomy with elevation of bone flap; for removal of epidural or subdural electrode array, without excision of cerebral tissue (separate procedure); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 61760 Stereotactic implantation of depth electrodes into the cerebrum for long term seizure monitoring.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regarding ICD-10 codes, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition (ICD-10) is a clinical cataloging system that went into effect for the U.S. healthcare industry on October 1, 2015, after a series of lengthy delays. Accounting for modern advances in clinical treatment and medical devices, ICD-10 codes offer many more classification options compared to those found in its predecessor, ICD-9. Within the healthcare industry, providers, coders, IT professionals, insurance carriers, government agencies and others use ICD codes to properly note diseases on health records, to track epidemiological trends and to assist in medical reimbursement decisions.



ICD-10 codes for epilepsy are as follows:




● | G40.0 Localization-related (focal) (partial) idiopathic epilepsy and epileptic syndromes with seizures of localized onset;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | G40.1 Localization-related (focal) (partial) symptomatic epilepsy and epileptic syndromes with simple partial seizures;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | G40.2 Localization-related (focal) (partial) symptomatic epilepsy and epileptic syndromes with complex partial seizures;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | G40.3 Generalized idiopathic epilepsy and epileptic syndromes;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | G40.A Absence epileptic syndrome;
--+----------------------------------


● | G40.4 Other generalized epilepsy and epileptic syndromes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | G40.50 Epileptic seizures related to external causes, not intractable;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | G40.80 Other epilepsy; and
--+---------------------------


● | G40.82 Epileptic spasms.
--+-------------------------




We believe that many of the indications we are pursuing with our technologies are currently reimbursed on a widespread basis by Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies.



Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new medical devices, and, as a result, their coverage policies may be restrictive, or they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products. In order to obtain reimbursement arrangements, we may have to agree to a net sales price lower than the net sales price we might charge in other sales channels. Our revenue may be limited by the continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various increasingly sophisticated means, such as requiring prospective reimbursement and second opinions, purchasing in groups, or redesigning benefits. Our future dependence on the commercial success of our technologies makes us particularly susceptible to any cost containment or reduction efforts. Accordingly, if government and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products and the related insertion and removal procedures, our financial performance will be negatively impacted.



Manufacturing, Supply and Quality Assurance



We currently outsource the supply and manufacture of all components of our prototypes of our technology under development. We plan to continue with an outsourced manufacturing arrangement for the foreseeable future. Our third-party manufacturers are recognized in their field for their competency to manufacture the respective portions of our system and have quality systems established that meet FDA requirements. We believe the manufacturers we currently utilize have sufficient capacity to meet our requirements; however, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to impact, our business”. We believe that as we increase our demand in the future, our per-unit costs will decrease materially. We have also identified capable second source manufacturers and suppliers in the event of disruption from any of our primary vendors.



Our suppliers meet the latest ISO 13485 certification, which includes design control requirements. As a medical device developer, the facilities of our sterilization and other critical suppliers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies. We believe that our quality systems and those of our suppliers are robust and achieve high product quality. We plan to audit our suppliers periodically to ensure conformity with the specifications, policies and procedures for our devices.

Research and Development



Our research and development team, which includes our Director of Electrode Development, utilizes advice from leading experts in the neurotech field on our scientific advisory board and is focused on the development of thin film cortical grid and strip electrodes and depth electrodes for recording, ablation and chronic stimulation for brain related disorders as well as stimulation for spinal cord stimulation for back related pain. Our research and development expenses were $3.9 million and $2.1 million for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Competition



In the market for Epilepsy diagnosis, our cortical strip, sheet and depth electrode technology will likely compete with Integra Life Science’s Integra Epilepsy Strip, Grid and depth electrodes, which provide a similar function to our diagnostic technologies. These products are well established in the marketplace and Integra has greater resources than us, which could allow them to innovate faster. Ad-Tech Medical Instrument Corporation’s Epilepsy/LTM (subdural grid, strip and depth) electrodes, which have become the market leaders for diagnostic mapping in epilepsy, and PMT’s Cortac Strips and grid electrodes and Depthalon depth electrodes are used for recording brain activity similar to other competitive technologies. In addition, Dixie Medical has launched a product line of depth electrodes and CorTec has launched a cortical electrode product line called AirRay. Today’s success rates for seizure free post-operative conditions remain at 50%, which has limited patients’ willingness to undergo the currently highly invasive surgical procedure. We will also compete against other companies in early stages of development of thin film technologies.



In the neuro-ablation market, we expect to compete with Medtronic’s Visualase guided-laser ablation technology and Monteris Medical’s NeuroBlate technology, which use MRI guided laser surgical ablation for use to ablate, necrotize or coagulate soft tissue through interstitial irradiation or thermal therapy in medicine and surgery in the discipline of neurosurgery with 1064 nm lasers. Their website claims it is used for ablation in the brain for soft tissue and tumors. We believe there are other laser-based systems in development that will compete with these technologies.



In the neurostimulation market, we expect to compete with NeuroPace’s RNS system approved for epilepsy, Medtronic’s Activa system approved for Parkinson’s disease, Boston Scientific Vercise (indicated for Parkinson’s, dystonia and essential tremors), Abbott/St. Jude Medical’s Infinity DBS system (approved for Parkinson’s disease and essential tremors), Liva Nova/Cyberonic’s VNS therapy intended for patients suffering with epilepsy. We believe there are additional companies pursuing thin film electrode technology for use in the brain although none are expected to be commercially available in 2022.



Although we will face potential competition from many different sources, we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources will provide us with competitive advantages. For a discussion of the key competitive factors that we believe will impact the success of our cortical strip and sheet electrodes under development, if successfully developed and approved, see “—Our Solution” above.



Many of the companies against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our development.

WARF License



In January 2020, we entered into the Amended and Restated Exclusive Start-Up Company License Agreement, dated as of January 21, 2020, as amended on June 15, 2020 (the “WARF License”) with WARF, which amended and restated in full the Original WARF License. Pursuant to the WARF License, WARF has granted to us an exclusive license to make, use and sell, in the United States only, products that employ certain licensed patents for a neural probe array or thin-film micro electrode array and method. We have agreed to pay WARF a royalty equal to a single-digit percentage of our product sales pursuant to the WARF License, with a minimum annual royalty payment of $50,000 for calendar year 2020, $100,000 for calendar year 2021 and $150,000 for calendar year 2022 and each calendar year thereafter that the WARF License is in effect. The minimum annual royalty payment for calendar year 2020 in the amount of $50,000 was paid in January 2021. If we or any of our sublicensees contest the validity of any licensed patent, the royalty rate will be doubled during the pendency of such contest and, if the contested patent is found to be valid and would be infringed by us if not for the WARF License, the royalty rate will be tripled for the remaining term of the WARF License.



WARF may terminate this license on 30 days’ written notice, if we default on the payments of amounts due to WARF or fail to timely submit development reports, actively pursue our development plan or breach any other covenant in the WARF License and fail to remedy such default in 90 days or in the event of certain bankruptcy events involving us. WARF may also terminate the WARF License (i) on 90 days’ notice if we had failed to have commercial sales of one or more FDA-approved products under the WARF License by June 30, 2021 or (ii) if, after royalties earned on sales begin to be paid, such earned royalties cease for more than four calendar quarters. The first commercial sale occurred on December 7, 2020, prior to the June 30, 2021 deadline. The WARF License otherwise expires by its terms on the date that no valid claims on the patents licensed thereunder remain. We expect the latest expiration of a licensed patent to occur in 2030.



In addition, WARF reserves the right to grant non-profit research institutions and government agencies non-exclusive licenses to practice and use the inventions of the licensed patents for non-commercial research purposes, and we grant WARF a non-exclusive, sub licensable, royalty-free right and license for non-commercial research purposes to use improvements to the licensed patents. In the event that we discontinue use or commercialization of the licensed patents or improvements thereon, we must grant WARF an option to obtain a non-exclusive, sub-licensable, royalty-bearing license to use the improvements for commercial purposes.



See “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Business—We depend on intellectual property licensed from WARF for our technology, including our technology under development, and the termination of this license would harm our business” for additional information regarding the WARF License.



Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research License and Development Agreement



In May 2017, we entered into the Amended and Restated License and Development Agreement, dated as of May 25, 2017 (the “Mayo Development Agreement”), with Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (“Mayo”) to license worldwide (i) certain know how for the development and commercialization of products, methods and processes related to flexible circuit thin film technology for the recording of tissue and (ii) the products developed therefrom, and to partner with Mayo to assist the Company in the investigation, research application, development and improvement of such technology. Mayo has agreed to assist us by providing access to certain individuals at Mayo (the “Mayo Principal Investigators”), in developing our cortical thin film flexible circuit technology, including prototype development, animal testing, protocol development for human and animal use, abstract development and presentation and access to and license of any intellectual property that the Mayo Principal Investigators develop relating to the procedure.



We have agreed to pay Mayo a royalty equal to a single-digit percentage of our product sales pursuant to the Mayo Development Agreement. Mayo may purchase any developed products licensed under the Mayo Development Agreement at the best price offered by us to the end user in the prior year. The Mayo Development Agreement generally will expire in October 2034, unless the Mayo know-how and improvements under the Mayo Development Agreement remain in use, and the Mayo Development Agreement may be terminated by Mayo for cause or under certain circumstances.



For additional information regarding the Mayo Development Agreement, see “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Business—We depend on our partnership with Mayo to license certain know how for the development and commercialization of our technology. Termination of this partnership would harm our business, and even if this partnership continues, it may not be successful.”

Intellectual Property



Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets as well as nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements, material transfer agreements, confidentiality agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
Patents



As of September 30, 2021, our patent estate consists of three issued United States patents licensed from WARF covering a neural probe array and thin-film micro electrode array and method, a pending U.S. patent application filed by us and published in 2018 covering our applications and additional devices used during the diagnostic and therapeutic ablation and stimulation procedures, pending U.S. and European patent applications filed by us and published in 2020 relating to improved neural depth electrodes, a pending U.S. patent application filed by us and published in 2020 relating to agent-delivering neural electrodes, three pending U.S. applications (and corresponding PCT applications) filed in 2020 and 2021 relating to minimally invasive electrodes, spinal cord stimulation devices, and additional electrode improvements and one additional pending U.S. application relating to devices with temperature sensors. The licensed issued patents expire between 2025 and 2030, subject to any patent extensions that may be available for such patents. If a patent or patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire between 2038 and 2042.



Our patent applications may not result in issued patents, and any patents that have been issued or may be issued in the future may not protect the commercially important aspects of our technology. Furthermore, the validity and enforceability of our issued patents may be challenged by third parties and our patents could be invalidated or modified by the issuing governmental authority. Third parties may independently develop technology that is not covered by our patents that is similar to, or competes with, our technology. In addition, our intellectual property may be infringed or misappropriated by third parties, particularly in foreign countries where the laws and governmental authorities may not protect our proprietary rights as effectively as those in the United States.



The medical device industry in general, and the recording, ablation and neurostimulation sector of this industry in particular, are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on assertions of patent infringement. We are aware of numerous patents issued to third parties that may relate to the technology used in our business, including the design and manufacture of electrodes and pulse generators, as well as methods for device placement. Each of these patents contains multiple claims, any one of which may be independently asserted against us. The owners of these patents may assert that the manufacture, use, sale or offer for sale of our cortical strip and sheet electrodes infringe one or more claims of their patents. Furthermore, there may be additional patents issued to third parties of which we are presently unaware that may relate to aspects of our technology that such third parties could assert against us and materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be patent applications that are currently pending and unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that third parties could assert against us and materially and adversely affect our business.



Any adverse determination in litigations, post grant trial proceedings, at the Patent Office relating to intellectual property to which we are or may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties, and result in the cancellation and/or invalidation of our intellectual property. Furthermore, if a court finds that we have willfully infringed a third party’s intellectual property, we could be required to pay treble damages and/or attorney fees for the prevailing party, in addition to other penalties. Although intellectual property disputes in the medical device area are often settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with such arrangements can be substantial and often require ongoing royalty payments. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we do not obtain necessary licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement; if we are able to redesign our products to avoid infringement, we may not receive FDA approval in a timely manner. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, which could have a significant adverse impact on our business.





17







Trademarks



We have a registered U.S. trademark for the “EVO” trademark. The document(s) updating the owner’s name were filed with the U.S. Trademark Office on November 30, 2021, with an effective date of December 30, 2019.
Trade Secrets



We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect such intellectual property and proprietary information by generally requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement as the case may be. Our agreements with our employees prohibit them from providing us with any intellectual property or proprietary information of third parties. We also generally require confidentiality agreements or material transfer agreements with third parties that receive or have access to our confidential information, data or other materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that our employees and third parties that have access to our confidential proprietary information will abide by the terms of their agreements. Despite the measures that we take to protect our intellectual property and confidential information, unauthorized third parties may copy aspects of our products or obtain and use our proprietary information.
Government Regulation



Our cortical strip, grid and depth electrodes are medical devices subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA and the U.S. CMS. Regulations cover virtually every critical aspect of a medical device company’s business operations, including research activities, product development, quality, manufacturing, supplier management and risk management, contracting, reimbursement, medical communications, and sales and marketing. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and the implementing regulations of the FDA (specifically, 21 Code of Regulations (21 CFR Parts 801- labeling, 803 – medical device reporting, 807 – registration and listing, subpart E premarket notification 510k, 812 - investigational device exemption, 814 – premarket approval and 820 – quality system regulation) and applicable FDA guidance) govern product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, product manufacturing, quality systems, import and export, product labeling, product storage, recalls and field safety corrective actions, advertising and promotion, product sales and distribution, and post-market clinical surveillance. Our business is subject to federal, state and local quality regulations, such as ISO 13485, ISO 14971, and FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) contained in 21 CFR Part 820.
Regulatory Framework in the United States



Device classification



The FDA characterizes medical devices into one of three classes, Class I, II, and III. Regulatory control increases from Class I to Class III. The device classification regulation defines the regulatory requirements for a general device type. Most Class I devices are exempt from Premarket Notification under 510(k); most Class II devices require Premarket Notification under 510(k); and most Class III devices require Premarket Approval.



Class I devices are subject to controls for labeling. However, most such devices are exempt from pre-market notification and adherence to the FDA’s QSR. This pertains to manufacturers’ methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of products. Class II devices are subject to the same general controls but may be subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidance, or particularized labeling, and may also require clinical testing prior to clearance or approval. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, including devices that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Premarket Approval is required for most Class III devices.



Some Class I and Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the pre-market notification requirement under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, but must meet the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR. However, a pre-market approval (“PMA application”) is required for devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or certain implantable devices, or those that are “not substantially equivalent” either to a device previously cleared through the 510(k) process or to a “preamendment” Class III device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 when PMA applications were not required. The PMA approval process is more comprehensive than the 510(k) clearance process and typically takes multiple years to complete.





18







Based on FDA classifications, we believe our diagnostic strip, grid depth electrode and RF ablation technology will be categorized by the FDA as Class II devices that do not require clinical testing and can be filed as a 510(k), similar to existing competitive technology. The Company expects that indications for treating epilepsy, Parkinson’s and other patients suffering from motor related neurological deficiencies via a permanent implant for chronic treatment will require a PMA process to commercially distribute in the United States.



The 510(k) clearance process



Under the 510(k) clearance process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to a PMA, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was previously found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use, indications for use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.



After a 510(k) premarket notification is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.



If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the De Novo process. The De Novo request provides a marketing pathway to classify novel medical devices for which general controls alone, or general and special controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the intended use, but for which there is no legally marketed predicate device. De Novo classification is a risk-based classification process. The De Novo classification process is an alternate pathway to classify medical devices that are automatically classified into Class III but which are low to moderate risk. A manufacturer can submit a Pre-submission (Q-Sub) for De Novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.



After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a De Novo device application and potentially a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires a new submission in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacture documents the change in an internal letter-to-file based on adherence to FDA guidance on changes to an existing 510(k) device. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for such change. The FDA can always review these letters to file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing 510(k)-cleared device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a De Novo or PMA application is obtained. In addition, in these circumstances, the FDA can impose significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite application(s).



The PMA approval process



Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin its review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA.



Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.





19







Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct inspections of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, as well as inspections of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:




● | the device may not be safe, effective, reliable or accurate to the FDA’s satisfaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




If an FDA evaluation of a PMA application is favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter, or approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of a device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.



New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.



Clinical Trials



Clinical trials are typically required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance. These trials generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”), to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for abbreviated IDE requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. The FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward, but it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA’s regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product. Clinical trials must be entered into the clinical trials registry at clinicaltrials.gov.



The commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application, for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:




● | the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






20








● | patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | patients, sponsor (NeuroOne) or study sites do not comply with trial protocols;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | patient follow-up is not at the rate expected;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | patients experience adverse side effects;
--+------------------------------------------


● | patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the products that are part of our trial;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices or other FDA requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the sponsor (NeuroOne) or third-party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to the sponsor (NeuroOne) or the study that the FDA deems to make the study results unreliable, or the company or investigators fail to disclose such interests;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA concludes that our trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Regulatory Requirements



Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:




● | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, risk management, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations that prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses, and impose other restrictions on labeling, advertising and promotion;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | MDR regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






21








● | voluntary and mandatory device recalls to address problems when a device is defective and could be a risk to health; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Also, the FDA may require us to conduct post-market surveillance studies or establish and maintain a system for tracking our products through the chain of distribution to the patient level. The FDA enforces regulatory requirements by conducting periodic, unannounced inspections and market surveillance. Inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors.



Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. These may include any of the following sanctions or consequences:




● | warning letters or untitled letters that require corrective action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines and civil penalties;
--+---------------------------


● | unanticipated expenditures;
--+----------------------------


● | delays in approving or refusal to approve future products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | suspension or withdrawal of FDA clearance or approval;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | product recall or seizure; interruption of production;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | operating restrictions;
--+------------------------


● | injunctions; and
--+-----------------


● | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------




Our contract manufacturers, specification developers and some suppliers of components or device accessories, also are required to manufacture our products in compliance with current good manufacturing practice requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and it includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If the FDA believes that any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down such manufacturing operations, require a recall of our products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and Similar Foreign and State Laws and Regulations Affecting the Transmission, Security and Privacy of Health Information



We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as service providers of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from HIPAA and each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect.
Fraud and Abuse Laws



In addition to FDA restrictions, there are numerous U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws. Our relationships with healthcare providers and other third parties are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs.



Federal Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Laws



The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (the “Anti-Kickback Statute”) prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a review of all its relevant facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of (or purchases, or recommendations related to) federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been implicated and potentially violated.



The penalties for violating the Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment for up to five years, fines of up to $25,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which do not have the same exceptions and apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Further, the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). Specifically, as noted above, under the Anti-Kickback Statute, the government must prove the defendant acted “knowingly” to prove a violation occurred. The ACA added a provision to clarify that with respect to violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute, “a person need not have actual knowledge” of the statute or specific intent to commit a violation of the statute. This change effectively overturns case law interpretations that set a higher standard under which prosecutors had to prove the specific intent to violate the law. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (the “False Claims Act”).



We plan to provide the initial training to providers and patients necessary for appropriate use of our technology either through our own educators or by contracting with outside educators that have completed an appropriate training course. Outside educators are reimbursed for their services at fair market value.



Noncompliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute could result in our exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, and civil and criminal penalties.





23







The federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibits a physician from ordering “designated health services,” including durable medical equipment, for Medicare and Medicaid patients from entities with which the physician (or an immediate family member) has a “financial relationship.” Financial relationships include both compensation arrangements and investment and ownership interests. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliant arrangement, civil penalties, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. We believe that we have structured our provider arrangements to comply with current Stark Law requirements.



Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.



Additionally, as some of these laws are still evolving, we lack definitive guidance as to the application of certain key aspects of these laws as they relate to our arrangements with providers with respect to patient training. We cannot predict the final form that these regulations will take or the effect that the final regulations will have on us. As a result, our provider and training arrangements may ultimately be found to be not in compliance with applicable federal law.



False Claims Act



The False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, amendments in 1986 to the False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against companies under the False Claims Act. Penalties include fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action.



There are other federal anti-fraud laws that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.



Additionally, HIPAA established two federal crimes related to making false statements in relation to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.



Civil Monetary Penalties Law



In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, the federal government has the authority to seek civil monetary penalties, or CMPs, assessments, and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a wide variety of prohibited conduct. For example, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law authorizes the imposition of substantial CMPs against an entity that engages in activities including, but not limited to: (1) knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, a claim for services not provided as claimed or which is otherwise false or fraudulent in any way; (2) knowingly giving or causing to be given false or misleading information reasonably expected to influence the decision to discharge a patient; (3) offering or giving remuneration to any beneficiary of a federal health care program likely to influence the receipt of reimbursable items or services; (4) arranging for reimbursable services with an entity which is excluded from participation from a federal health care program; (5) knowingly or willfully soliciting or receiving remuneration for a referral of a federal health care program beneficiary; or (6) using a payment intended for a federal health care program beneficiary for another use. The government is authorized to seek different amounts of CMPs and assessments based on underlying violation. For false or fraudulent claims, the government may seek a penalty of up to $10,000 for each item or service improperly claimed, and an assessment of up to three times the amount improperly claimed. For kickback violations, the government may seek a penalty of up to $50,000 for each improper act and damages of up to three times the amount of remuneration at issue.





24







State Fraud and Abuse Provisions



Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and a false claims act. We believe that we are in conformance to such laws. Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
Physician Payment Sunshine Act



Transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers and teaching hospitals may also impact our business practices. The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires most medical device manufacturers to report annually to the Secretary of Human Health Services financial arrangements, payments, or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals. The payment information is made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website. Over the next several years, we will need to dedicate significant resources to establish and maintain systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties. Similar laws have been enacted or are under consideration in foreign jurisdictions.
Human Capital 



As of September 30, 2021, we had 11 employees, all of whom are full-time, 6 of whom are engaged in research and development activities, and all of whom are located in the United States. As of September 30, 2021, we also retained the services of approximately 11 regular consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. During our 2021 fiscal year, we did not experience any turnover among our employees.
