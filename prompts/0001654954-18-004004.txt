 DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS
 
  Organizational History
  
 We were incorporated as HapyKidz.com, Inc. in Nevada on July 28, 2011 with the intention to become an e-commerce marketplace that connects merchants to consumers by offering daily discounts on goods and services through a proprietary website. We were not successful in this endeavor.
  
 On September 4, 2013, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to change our name from HapyKidz.com, Inc. to Symbid Corp.
  
 On December 6, 2013, we closed a share exchange (the “Share Exchange”) pursuant to which the 19 shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V. sold all of their capital stock in Symbid Holding B.V. to us in exchange for 352,834 shares of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”). As a result of the Share Exchange, Symbid Holding B.V. became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours.
  
 As the result of the Share Exchange, we were engaged in the business of creating and operating online, equity based crowdfunding platforms, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Symbid Holding B.V. Commencing in 2015, we expanded our operations to include an online platform for small and medium sized enterprise funding, connecting new and traditional sources of finance in one integrated network built around our technology.
  
 The Share Exchange was treated as a recapitalization of the Company for financial accounting purposes and Symbid Holding B.V. was considered the acquiror for accounting purposes.
  
 In accordance with “reverse acquisition” accounting treatment, our historical financial statements as of period ends, and for periods ended, prior to the Share Exchange were replaced with the historical financial statements of Symbid Holding B.V. prior to the Share Exchange in our post Share Exchange filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
  
 Due to cash flow problems, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we were forced to restructure the Company, curtail certain business operations and change our focus from the operation of online funding platforms and the provision of software solutions for alternative financing in the small and medium enterprise market to the licensing of software packages for which we own or license the intellectual property.
  
 On June 8, 2017, we dissolved our direct, wholly owned subsidiary, Symbid Holding B.V. and our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, Symbid B.V. and FAC B.V. At the time of dissolution, none of these entities had any material assets or operations and none of these entities were generating revenues. Following such dissolutions, we had no subsidiaries.
  
 On June 9, 2017, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to change our name to Sincerity Applied Materials Holdings Corp. (the “Name Change”) and effected a 60:1 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”) on our Common Stock. The Name Change and Revenue Stock Split took effect on the over-the-counter market at the open of business on June 14, 2017, at which time our Common Stock began to trade on a post-split basis under the symbol “SBIDD”. Our Common Stock began trading under the Symbol “SINC” on July 13, 2017. The Reverse Split and the Name Change were approved by our board of directors on May 1, 2017 and by stockholders holding 80% of our outstanding voting stock on May 1, 2017 as further described in our Definitive Information Statement on Schedule 14C which we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 4, 2017 and mailed to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 1, 2017.

 On September 19, 2017 we acquired Sincerity Australia Pty Ltd., an Australia corporation (“SAPL”) pursuant to the closing under a June 5, 2017 Acquisition Agreement as amended on July 7, 2017, July 21, 2017, August 15, 2017, August 23, 2017, September 1, 2017 and September 15, 2017 (the “Acquisition Agreement”) among the Company, SAPL and the sole shareholder/member of SAPL (the “SAPL Shareholder”). Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement and the acquisition completed thereunder (the “Acquisition”) we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of SAPL consisting of 10,000 Ordinary Shares (the “Ordinary Shares”) from the SAPL Shareholder in exchange for 45,211,047 shares (the “Acquisition Shares”) of our Common Stock making SAPL a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. At the time of the closing under the Acquisition Agreement, SAPL had no outstanding securities other than the Ordinary Shares.
  
 As a result of the Acquisition, we acquired the business of SAPL and have continued the existing business operations of SAPL as a publicly-traded company under the name Sincerity Applied Materials Holdings Corp.
  
 On September 19, 2017, in conjunction with the closing of the Acquisition, we sold 15 units of securities (the “Units”) in a private placement offering (the “September 2017 Offering”), at a purchase price of $10,000 per Unit (the “Unit Offering Price”), each Unit consisting of (i) one 12% senior secured convertible promissory note (the “Note”) in the face (principal) amount of $10,000 and (ii) one warrant (the “Warrant”) exercisable for a period of five years representing the right to purchase Thirty Three Thousand Three Hundred Thirty Four (33,334) shares of Common Stock.
  
 Unless otherwise indicated, references to share amounts in this report give retroactive effect to the 60:1 Reverse Split.
  
 Prior to the Acquisition, we were a “shell company” (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act). As a result of the Acquisition, we ceased to be a “shell company”.
  
 The issuance of shares of our common stock in the Acquisition was exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act.
  
 On November 9, 2017 we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with two persons, pursuant to which we sold (i) convertible promissory notes dated November 9, 2017 in the aggregate principal amount of $108,000 due on November 9, 2018, (ii) three-year Class A Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 102,858 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment) at an initial exercise price of $6.00 per share (subject to adjustment), and (iii) three-year Class B Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 800,000 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment) at an initial exercise price of $7.50 per share (subject to adjustment).
  
 On December 19, 2017 we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with one person pursuant to which we sold a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $112,500 due on August 20, 2018.
  
 On January 9, 2018 we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated December 19, 2017 with one person pursuant to which we sold a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $83,500 due on December 19, 2018.
  
 The terms of the securities sold in our September 19, 2017, November 9, 2017, December 19, 2017 and January 9, 2018 offerings are described in greater detail below under the heading “The September 2017, November 2017, December 2017 and January 2018 Offerings.”

  Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
  
 We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012. An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:

● | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
 We may take advantage of these provisions through December 31, 2018. If certain events occur prior to December 31, 2018, including if we become a “large accelerated filer,” our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company prior to December 31 2018.
  
 We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. We have taken advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this registration statement and may elect to take advantage of other reduced burdens in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
  
 Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. However, we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
  
 We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosure available to smaller reporting companies.
  
  Our Corporate Information
  
 Our corporate headquarters are located at 4 Avoca Street, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia 3141 and our telephone number is +61-4-2100-7277. Our filings with the Securities Exchange Commission, or SEC, are available free of charge through the SEC website.
 Overview
  
 We are a supplier of technologically advanced plastics and other solutions for the packaging industry and other industries primarily serving major end users and distributors in Australia, Asia and the Middle East. Our products have applications in the areas of packaging, agriculture, automotive and transportation, paint and coating, construction, personal care and hygiene, electronics, pharmaceutical, energy and natural resources, plastics and rubber and leather. Our principal products are high quality, breathable plastic film and modified atmosphere packaging used in the packaging of perishable foods.
  
 In 2016, we established a relationship with the Visyboard Group (“Visy”), a global manufacturer of a wide range of packaging products including corrugated, plastic film and containers and aluminum. Visy has annual sales in excess of US$ 6 billion and operations in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Australia. Visy is Australia’s largest packaging reseller and manufacturer and has 24 plants and facilities in Australia. Visy has traditionally focused on converted packaging and extruded plastics. With increasing consumer attention on fresh food and durables as well as environmental impact of discarded packaging, Visy is seeking to build its market share in the manufacture and supply of fresh food packaging.

 Our platform whereby plastic film production lines utilize micro laser technology to adjust the flow of oxygen and other gases to correspond with the different requirements of fresh produce has a significant impact in extending the shelf life of the product, often by several weeks. Shelf life is becoming a critical issue for exporters, wholesalers and most importantly, retailers
  
 In addition to the plastic film business, we expect to increase our supply of extruded plastic pallets for aluminum cans to Visy which operates the largest aluminum recycling business in Australia. We are also serving Visy’s selling agent in the export of up to 100,000 tons per annum of PET plastics from Australia to China for recycling.
  
  Directors and Officers
  
 Our board of directors currently consists of three members, Zhang Yiwen (Chairman), Zhang Leping and Fan Yang. Zhang Yiwen and Zhang Leping were each appointed upon the closing of the September 19, 2017 Acquisition. Fan Yang was appointed on February 5, 2018. Nils Ollquist resigned as a director on March 23, 2018 due to differences with other members of management on how to grow the Company and move it forward.
  
 Zhang Yiwen serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Lim as our Chief Financial Officer, Eter Huang as our Treasurer and Simon Rees as Chief Operating Officer. Zhang Yiwen is our principal executive officer and Chris Lim is our principal financial and accounting officer for SEC reporting purposes. Praba Ganeshan was terminated as our Treasurer on January 1, 2018 and Nils Ollquist was terminated as our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary on March 2, 2018. We terminated Mr. Ganeshan as an executive officer due to our dissatisfaction with his performance. We terminated Mr. Ollquist as an executive officer due to our dissatisfaction with his performance. See “Management-Directors and Executive Officers” below for information about our directors and executive officers.
  
  Lock-up Agreements and Other Restrictions
  
 In connection with the Acquisition, the SAPL Shareholder ( the “Restricted Holder”), entered into a lock-up agreement, (the “Lock-Up Agreements”), whereby it is restricted for a period of twenty-four months after the Acquisition (the “restricted Period”), from certain sales or dispositions (including pledges) of all of our Common Stock held by (or issuable to) it, such restrictions together referred to as the Lock-Up. The foregoing restrictions do not apply to the resale of shares of Common Stock by the Restricted Holder in any registered secondary offering of equity securities by us (and, if such offering is underwritten, with the written consent of the lead or managing underwriter), or to certain other transfers customarily excepted.
  
 In addition, the Restricted Holder agreed, for a period of 12 months following the Closing Date, that it will not, directly or indirectly, effect or agree to effect any short sale (as defined in Rule 200 under Regulation SHO of the Exchange Act), whether or not against the box, establish any “put equivalent position” (as defined in Rule 16a-1(h) under the Exchange Act) with respect to the Common Stock, borrow or pre-borrow any shares of Common Stock, or grant any other right (including, without limitation, any put or call option) with respect to the Common Stock or with respect to any security that includes, relates to or derives any significant part of its value from the Common Stock or otherwise seek to hedge its position in the Common Stock.
  
  The September 2017, November 2017, December 2017 and January 2018 Offerings
  
  September 2017 Offering
  
 In conjunction with the closing of the Acquisition, we held a closing of our September 2017 Offering in which we sold 15 Units, at a purchase price of $10,000 per Unit or an aggregate of $150,000. Each Unit consists of (1) one 12% senior secured convertible promissory note (the “Note”) of the Company in the face (principal) amount of $10,000 and; (ii) one warrant (the “Warrant”) exercisable for a period of five years representing the right to purchase Thirty-Three Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-Four (33,334) shares of Common Stock.
  
   
5


  
 
 The September 2017 Offering was exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC thereunder. The Units in the 2017 Offering were sold to “accredited investors,” as defined in Regulation D, and was conducted on a “reasonable best efforts” basis.
  
 The closing under the September 2017 Offering was conditioned on the closing of the Acquisition.
  
 The Warrants comprising part of the PPO Units sold in the September 2017 Offering entitle their holders to purchase an aggregate of 500,010 shares of Common Stock, (33,334 shares of Common Stock per Unit sold), and have a term of five years. Each Warrant is exercisable upon the earlier of (i) a Qualified Financing (as defined below) or (ii) one year from the effective date of the Warrants both (i) and (ii) above being subject to acceleration in the event a Non-Qualified Financing (as defined below) takes place within one year of the effective date of the Warrants and prior to a Qualified Financing. A Qualified Financing means a financing of not less than $20,000,000 completed by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company after the effective date of the Warrants involving the sale of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents (as defined below). A Non-Qualified Financing means a financing of less than $20,000,000 completed by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company after the effective date of the Warrants involving the sale of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents.
  
 In the case of a Qualified Financing, the Warrants are exercisable at a price per share equal to 80% of the lesser of (i) the price at which Common Stock is sold in the Qualified Financing, or (ii) the lowest price at which other securities sold in the Qualified Financing may be converted into or exercised for Common Stock (such other securities being hereafter referred to as "Common Stock Equivalents").
  
 Subject to the prior completion of a Non-Qualified Financing at a Post-Acquisition Valuation (as defined below) of less than $15,000,000, if a Qualified Financing is not completed within one year of the Effective Date, the Warrants will be exercisable at a price per share equal to 80% of the value weighted average price per share of Common Stock ("VWAP") of the Company during the ten consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date on which a notice of exercise is received by the Company from a holder of Warrants. The VWAP based exercise price may not be less than $0.10 per share.
  
 Except in the case of a prior Non-Qualified Financing at a Post-Acquisition Valuation of less than $15,000,000, in the event the Company or a subsidiary of the Company shall issue Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents within one year of the effective date of the Warrants in a Qualified Financing at a price per share reflecting a Post-Acquisition Valuation (as defined below) of less than $15,000,000, the exercise price and the number of shares to be obtained upon exercise of the Warrants will be adjusted proportionally. "Post-Acquisition Valuation" means the post-Acquisition, pre-financing valuation of the Company obtained by multiplying the 50,000,000 shares of Common Stock assumed to be issued and outstanding immediately following the Acquisition and the Offering by the lowest price at which Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are to be sold in a post-Acquisition financing. By way of example, a post-Acquisition financing in which Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are sold at $0.30 per share would result in a Post-Acquisition Valuation of $15,000,000, which represents the number obtained when multiplying 50,000,000 by $0.30.
  
 Except in the case of a prior Non-Qualified Financing at a Post-Acquisition Valuation of less than $15,000,000, in the event the Company or subsidiary of the Company does not complete a Qualified Financing within one year of the effective date of the Warrants such that the Warrants becomes exercisable at a price per share equal to 80% of the VWAP of the Common Stock and the Company or a subsidiary of the Company thereafter completes a Qualified Financing or other financing prior to the expiration date of the Warrants at a price per share reflecting a Post-Acquisition Valuation of less than $15,000,000, the VWAP exercise price formula then in effect and the number of shares to be obtained upon exercise of the Warrants shall be adjusted proportionally. In the event the Company or a subsidiary of the Company shall thereafter complete one or more additional Qualified Financings or other financings at a valuation lower than a valuation which previously triggered a VWAP and related share amount adjustment, the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and the VWAP % used to determine the exercise price under such Warrants would be further adjusted proportionately, in the same manner as provided above.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Company or a subsidiary of the Company shall complete a Non-Qualified Financing at a Post-Acquisition Valuation of less than $15,000,000 within one year of the effective date of a Warrant and prior to a Qualified Financing, the Warrants shall become immediately exercisable at a VWAP based price per share under the same terms and conditions set forth in the paragraph immediately above, including those relating to a proportional reduction to the VWAP % and an increase in the number of shares issuable upon exercise of such Warrants. Any subsequent Non-Qualified Financings or Qualified Financings taking place while the Warrants remain outstanding shall be treated in the same manner as set forth in the last sentence of the paragraph immediately above. Certain issuances of securities defined in the Warrant as Exempt Issuances do not trigger any of the foregoing anti-dilution adjustments.
  
 If the Company, at any time while the Warrants are outstanding and the exercise price has been established, sells or grants any option to purchase, or sells or grants any right to reprice, or otherwise disposes of or issues (or announces any offer, sale, grant or any option to purchase or other disposition) any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents, at an effective price per share less than the exercise price then in effect (such lower price, the “New Issuance Price” and such issuances collectively, a “Dilutive Issuance” (it being understood and agreed that if the holder of the Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents so issued shall at any time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset provisions, floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or due to warrants, options or rights per share which are issued in connection with such issuance, be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share that is less than the exercise price, such issuance shall be deemed to have occurred for less than the exercise price on such date of the Dilutive Issuance at such effective price) then simultaneously with consummation of each Dilutive Issuance the exercise price shall be reduced to an amount equal to the New Issuance Price (the “Adjusted Price”); (subject to adjustment for stock splits, reverse splits and similar capital adjustments). Such adjustment shall be made whenever such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment shall be made, paid or issued under this paragraph in the case of an Exempt Issuance.
  
 An aggregate of $150,000 in face (principal) amount of Notes were sold in the September 2017 Offering. Interest at the rate of 12% per annum is payable in shares of Common Stock in the event of conversion or in cash on October 19, 2018 (the "Maturity Date").
  
 In the event a holder of a Note has not converted their Note into Common Stock prior to the Maturity Date and the Company is unable to pay the Note in cash, the term of the Note shall automatically extend for one additional month and shall automatically extend for additional one month periods in the event that the Company remains unable to pay the Note in cash on the Maturity Date, as such may be extended. At least 30 days prior to the Maturity Date, including all extensions thereof, the Company must give the holder written notice of its ability to pay the Note in cash, during which period holder shall retain the right to convert the Note, including accrued interest due thereon, on the terms set forth therein. Failure to provide such notice on a timely basis, or otherwise, results in an automatic extension of the Maturity Date.
  
 From and after the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Notes), the interest rate will be increased to eighteen percent (18%) per annum until cured.
  
 All outstanding principal and accrued interest then due on the Notes is convertible at the option of each holder, in whole or in part, at any time after the earlier of (i) the completion of a Qualified Financing, subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth below; or (ii) the one-year anniversary of the original issue date, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the outstanding principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest due thereon by the QF Based Note Conversion Price (as defined below) or the VWAP Based Note Conversion Price (as defined below), as applicable, in effect at the time of conversion.
  
 Except as otherwise provided below, the Note conversion price per share of Common Stock is (i) in the event of the completion of a Qualified Financing prior to the one-year anniversary of the original issue date, 80% of the lowest price at which Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are sold in the Qualified Financing (the "QF Based Note Conversion Price"); or (ii) in the event a Qualified Financing is not completed prior to the one-year anniversary of the original issue date, 80% of the VWAP for the Common Stock during the ten consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date on which a notice of conversion is received by the Company from the holder (the "VWAP Based Note Conversion Price"), subject to a minimum VWAP Based Note Conversion Price of $0.10 per share (the "Note Floor Price"); provided, however, that the QF Based Note Conversion Price, the VWAP Based Note Conversion Price, the Note Floor Price and the rate at which Notes may be converted into shares of Common Stock, is subject to adjustment as provided below.

 The obligations of the Company to each holder under the Notes is secured by a first priority security interest in all now owned or hereafter acquired and owned assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, pari passu with the other holders of Notes as set forth in the Security Agreement dated September 19, 2017 (the "Security Agreement") among the Company, each holder and the person appointed by the purchasers of a majority of the Units sold in the September 2017 Offering to serve as the collateral agent thereunder.
  
 While any Notes remain in effect and until all outstanding principal and interest and all fees and all other expenses or amounts payable under any such Notes have been paid in full, unless the holders of Notes representing more than 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding otherwise consent in writing, the Company will not (i) incur, create, assume, guaranty or permit to exist any indebtedness that ranks senior in priority to, or pari passu with, the obligations under the Notes (other than trade payables and accrued liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices); (ii) create, incur, assume or permit to exist any lien on any Collateral (as such term is defined in the Security Agreement) now owned or hereafter acquired and owned by it or on any income or revenues or rights in respect thereof, except existing liens, subject to customary exceptions; (iii) declare or pay, directly or indirectly, any divided or make any other distribution (by reduction of capital or otherwise), whether in cash, property, securities or a combination thereof, with respect to any shares of its capital stock or directly or indirectly redeem, purchase, retire or otherwise acquire for value any shares of any class of its capital stock or set aside any amount for any such purpose; (iv) pay in cash any amount in respect of any indebtedness or preferred stock that may at the obligor's option be paid in kind or in other securities; or optionally prepay, repurchase or redeem or otherwise defease or segregate funds with respect to any indebtedness of the Company, other than indebtedness under the Notes; or (v) amend, modify or limit any terms of the Notes or the Security Agreement or assert the invalidity of the Notes or the Security Agreement.
  
 Except as otherwise provided below, in the event the Company or a subsidiary of the Company issues or sells Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents, within one year of the original issue date of the Notes, in a Qualified Financing, at a price per share reflecting a Post­ Acquisition Valuation of less than $15,000,000, the QF Based Note Conversion Price and the number of Conversion Shares that can be acquired upon conversion of the Notes will be adjusted proportionally.
  
 In the event the Company or a subsidiary of the Company does not complete a Qualified Financing within one year of the original issue date of the Notes such that the Notes become exercisable at a price per share equal to 80% of the VWAP of the Common Stock as set forth above, and the Company or a subsidiary of the Company thereafter, while any Notes remain outstanding, complete a Qualified Financing or other financing reflecting a Post-Acquisition Valuation of less than $15,000,000, the VWAP Based Note Conversion Price then in effect and the number of Conversion Shares to be obtained upon conversion of each outstanding Note will be adjusted proportionally. In the event the Company or a subsidiary of the Company shall thereafter, while any Notes remain outstanding, complete one or more additional Qualified Financings or other financings at a valuation lower than a valuation which previously triggered a VWAP and related share amount adjustment, the number of shares issuable upon conversion of such outstanding Notes and the VWAP % used to determine the VWAP Based Note Conversion Price under such Notes will be further adjusted proportionately, in the same manner as provided above.
  
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Company or a subsidiary of the Company completes a Non-Qualified Financing at a Post­ Acquisition Valuation of less than $15,000,000 within one year of the original issue date of the Notes and prior to a Qualified Financing, each Note will become immediately convertible at a VWAP based price per share under the same terms and conditions set forth in the paragraph immediately above, including those relating to a proportional reduction to the VWAP % and an increase in the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes. Any subsequent Non-Qualified Financings or Qualified Financings taking pace while a Note remains outstanding will be treated in the same manner as set forth in the last sentence of the paragraph immediately above.

  November 2017 Offering
  
 On November 9, 2017 we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with Emunah Funding, LLC (“Emunah”) and Fourth Man, LLC (“Fourth Man”), Emunah and Fourth Man hereinafter being collectively referred to as the “Purchasers,” pursuant to which we issued and sold to the Purchasers convertible promissory notes, dated November 9, 2017, in the aggregate principal amount of $108,000 (the “Notes”). The Notes were subject to an 8% original issue discount resulting in an aggregate purchase price to the Purchasers of $100,000. Pursuant to the SPA, we also issued three year warrants (the “Warrants) to the Purchasers, dated November 9, 2017, consisting of Class A Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 102,858 shares (subject to adjustment) of our common stock at an initial exercise price of $6.00 per share and Class B Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 800,000 shares (subject to adjustment) of our common stock at an initial exercise price of $7.50 per share. The Class A Warrants and Class B Warrants are hereinafter referred to as the “Warrants”. The SPA provides for us to register the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes and the exercise of the Warrants.
  
 The outstanding principal balance of the Notes, including accrued interest then due thereon, can be prepaid by us, in whole or in part, at any time during the 179-day period following November 9, 2017, upon five business days prior written notice, at a premium of 118%. Commencing on February 9, 2018 and monthly thereafter we are required to pay all accrued interest then due on the Notes together with 15% of the original principal amount of the Notes. The Notes are convertible at any time commencing 170 days after November 9, 2017 at 75% of the lowest trading price for our common stock during the 20 trading days ending on the last trading day prior to the conversion date. We are required to initially reserve 2,000,000 shares of our common stock to cover Note conversions and Warrant exercises. We are also required to cause our transfer agent to issue and transfer shares to the holders of the Notes within five trading days of our receipt of a conversation notice. If we fail to deliver certificates within the required delivery period, the converting holder has the right to rescind such conversion and we will be required to pay liquidated damages to such holders. Such delivery failure may also subject us to the buy-in liability. The conversion price of the Notes is subject to customary adjustments for stock splits and stock dividends, subsequent rights offerings, pro rata shareholder distributions and fundamental transactions. The conversion price is also subject to full ratchet anti-dilution protection triggered by sales of our common stock orcommon stock equivalents, excluding Exempt Issuances, as such term is defined therein, during the term of the Notes, at a price below the conversion price in effect at the time of issuance. The Notes also contain negative covenants which restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions or take certain actions while the Notes are outstanding without the prior written consent of the holders of the Notes. If an Event of Default, Fundamental Transaction or Change of Control Transaction, as such terms are defined in the Notes, occurs, the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, liquidated damages, and other amounts owing in respect thereof through the date of acceleration, becomes, at the holder’s election, immediately due and payable in cash at the Mandatory Default Amount, as such term is defined in the Notes. Commencing on the maturity date of the Notes, if the Notes have not been repaid by such date, or five days after the occurrence of an Event of Default, interest on the Notes accrues at the rate of 24% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law. The Notes contain customary Events of Default including, but not limited to, (i) the failure to pay principal, interest or liquidated damages when due; (ii) breach of Note covenants or agreements; (iii) breach of representation or warranties made in the Notes or other transaction documents; (iv) bankruptcy events; (v) Change of Control or Fundamental Transactions; (vi) failure to satisfy current public information requirements under Rule 144; (vii) certificate delivery failures; (viii) breaches of material terms of the SPA; (ix) the entry of a monetary judgment, writ or similar final process involving more than $50,000 which remains unvacated, unbonded or unstayed for a period of 90 days; (x) any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of our business; (xi) failure to maintain the listing of our common stock on a trading market; (xii) our effectuation of a reverse stock split without 10 days prior written notice to the holders; (xiii) the required restatement of our financial statements; or (xiv) our default under any of the other Notes.
  
 The Class A Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis. We are required to deliver certificates upon exercise within 3 trading days of our receipt of all holder deliverables. Failure to do so requires us to pay liquidated damages to the holders and subjects us to potential buy-in liability. The Class A Warrants contain adjustment provisions, including full ratchet anti-dilution rights, which are identical, in all material respects, to those contained in the Notes. The Class B Warrants are identical to the Class A Warrants in all material respects except that they are not exercisable on a cashless basis, they have a higher initial exercise price, are exercisable for more shares than the Class A Warrants and have exercise limitations. The Class B Warrants cannot be exercised absent a default under the Notes. They are not exercisable prior to the 16th day after an Event of Default under the Notes. For every $27 of principal repaid on the Notes prior to an Event of Default or within 15 day of an Event of Default, 200 Warrants exercisable under the holder’s Class B Warrants will be cancelled such that if the entire principal amount and all accrued interest due on a holder’s Note is repaid prior to the 16th day after an Event of Default, all of the Warrants exercisable under the holder’s Class B Warrants will be cancelled and will no longer be exercisable.

In connection with the foregoing, we also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the Purchaser dated November 20, 2017 (the “Registration Rights Agreement”).

The discount increases an additional 30% if we cease to be a reporting company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or if we fail to deliver free trading stock to the Purchaser upon a conversion of the Note after 181 days from the issuance date of the Note. Further, our failure to timely deliver shares to the Purchaser upon conversion will result in a payment to Purchaser of $2,000 in cash per day.
  
  We have the right to prepay the Note within 90 days of the issuance date at a premium of 135% of all amounts owed to Purchaser and at a premium of 150% if prepaid more than 90 but less than 180 days following the issuance date. We have no right to prepay the Note more than 180 days after the issuance date.
  
  The Note contains customary default events which, if triggered and not timely cured, will result in default interest and penalties. The Note also contains a right of first refusal provision with respect to future financings by us. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we are required to register the shares into which the Note is converted.

The registration rights subject us to penalties and damages, in varying degrees, if we fail to file the registration statement, have it declared effective and maintain its effectiveness under certain timelines and conditions. Certain of the registration obligations require that the registration statement be kept effective until the earlier of the date on which (i) the selling stockholders can sell all of their securities covered by the registration statement under Rule 144, without restriction; or (ii) all of the securities registered on behalf of the seller stockholder have been sold. We are in default of our obligation under certain of the Offerings to timely file the registration statement.
  
 We must comply with the informational requirements of Rule 144 so long as any shares of Common Stock issued in the Offering are subject to Rule 144, regardless of whether we are subject to filing requirements under the Exchange Act.
  
 We will pay all expenses in connection with our registration obligations, including, without limitation, all registration, filing, stock exchange fees, printing expenses, all fees and expenses of complying with applicable securities laws, and the fees and disbursements of our counsel and of our independent accountants.
