Item 1. Business
General

The Boston Beer Company, Inc. and certain subsidiaries (the “Company”) are engaged in the business of selling alcohol beverages throughout the United States and in selected international markets, under the trade names “The Boston Beer Company®”, “Twisted Tea Brewing Company®”, “Hard Seltzer Beverage Company”, “Angry Orchard® Cider Company”, “Dogfish Head® Craft Brewery”, “Dogfish Head Distilling Co.”, “Angel City® Brewing Company”, “Coney Island® Brewing Company” and “Bevy Long Drink Co.”

Boston Beer produces alcohol beverages, including hard seltzer, malt beverages (“beers”), and hard cider at Company-owned breweries and its cidery and under contract arrangements at other brewery locations. The four primary Company-owned breweries are focused on production and research and development and include breweries located in Boston, Massachusetts (the “Boston Brewery”), Cincinnati, Ohio (the “Cincinnati Brewery”), Milton, Delaware (the “Milton Brewery”) and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania (the “Pennsylvania Brewery”). These breweries, with the exception of the Pennsylvania Brewery, have tap rooms for retail sales on site. The Company produces a small but growing amount of distilled spirits and spirits based ready to drink beverages (“spirits RTDs”) at the Milton Brewery and other contract brewery locations.

The Company also owns five smaller local breweries that are mainly focused on brewing and packaging beers for retail sales on site at tap rooms and gift shops, restaurant activities, developing innovative and traditional beers and in some cases, supporting draft and package accounts in the respective local market areas. These local breweries are located in Boston, Massachusetts (the “Samuel Adams Boston Downtown Tap Room”), Rehoboth, Delaware (“Dogfish Head Brewings and Eats”), Los Angeles, California (the “Angel City Brewery”), Brooklyn, New York (the “Coney Island Brewery”) and Miami, Florida (the “Dogfish Head Miami Brewery”).

In addition, the Company owns an apple orchard and cidery located in Walden, New York (the “Orchard” and “Cidery”), a restaurant in Rehoboth, Delaware (“Chesapeake & Maine”) and a boutique inn in Lewes, Delaware (the “Dogfish Inn”).

The Company sells its beverages in various packages. Sleek cans, standard cans and bottles are sold primarily for off-premise retailers, which include grocery stores, club stores, convenience stores, liquor stores, and other traditional and e-commerce retail outlets. Kegs are sold primarily for on-premise retailers, which include bars, restaurants, stadiums and other venues.

The Company’s principal executive offices are located at One Design Center Place, Suite 850, Boston, Massachusetts 02210, and its telephone number is (617) 368-5000.

Industry Background

Most of the Company’s products are sold through off-premise retailers and the Company estimates the size of its markets using third-party metrics from measured off-premise channels, which is standard in the beer industry. The Company’s hard seltzers, beers, and hard ciders are primarily positioned in the market for High End beer occasions. The Company defines “High End” beers as including hard seltzer and flavored malt beverages, craft beers, domestic specialty beers, and most imported beer and hard cider that are called for by a High End beer drinker occasion. High End beers and beer occasions (the “High End category”) are determined by higher price, quality, image and taste, as compared with regular domestic beers.

The High End category has seen high single-digit compounded annual growth over the past ten years. The Company believes that the High End category is positioned to increase market share, as drinkers continue to trade up in taste and quality. Boston Beer is one of the largest suppliers in the High End category in the United States. The Company estimates that the High End full year percentage volume growth in 2020 and 2021 was approximately 25% and 2%, respectively. These trends are significantly above the total beer category percentage volume growth of 10% in 2020 and a decline of approximately 5% in 2021. The Company believes that the High End category is now over 38% of the United States beer market and the Company has approximately an 11% market share of the High End category.

The domestic beer industry, excluding the High End category, has experienced a decline in shipment volume over the last twenty years. The Company believes that this decline is due to declining alcohol consumption per person in the population, drinkers trading up to drink high-quality, more flavorful beers, health and wellness trends and increased competition from wine and spirits companies.
 

Before Prohibition, the United States beer industry consisted of hundreds of small breweries that brewed full-flavored beers. After the end of Prohibition, most domestic brewers shifted production to less flavorful, lighter beers, which use lower-cost ingredients, and can be mass-produced to take advantage of economies of scale in production. This shift towards mass-produced beers coincided with consolidation in the beer industry that by 2008 ultimately resulted in the two largest breweries, Anheuser-Busch InBev (“AB InBev”) and Molson Coors Beverage Company (“Molson Coors”), comprising over 90% of all United States domestic beer production. At the same time, during the last twenty years the number of breweries in the United States has increased significantly from approximately 1,500 in 2009 to over 8,000 in 2021. Most of these new breweries are craft (small and independent) brewers. The rise of craft breweries along with the growth of imported beers and hard seltzers has resulted in a significant decline in the volume of the two largest breweries who now comprise approximately 77% of all United States domestic beer production, excluding imports.

The Company and the alcohol industry, at large, is forecasting significant growth in a newly defined category named “Beyond Beer” that includes hard seltzer, flavored malt beverages, cider, spirits RTDs and other emerging beverages. The Company believes that the Beyond Beer category grew approximately 14% in 2021 and is now over 19% of the combined United States beer market and Beyond Beer category. The Company has approximately a 26% market share of the Beyond Beer category.
 
In 2021, the Company entered the market for spirits RTDs through its Dogfish Head brand and is planning to introduce two more brands into this market during 2022. The spirits RTDs market is relatively new and emerging and the Company estimates it grew 118% during 2021.

Description of the Company’s Business

The Company’s business goal is to become the leading supplier in the High End and Beyond Beer categories by creating and offering high quality alcohol beverages. With the support of a large, well-trained sales organization and world-class brewers, the Company strives to achieve this goal by offering consumer-responsive hard seltzers, beers, hard ciders, and spirits RTDs, increasing brand availability and awareness through traditional media and digital advertising, point-of-sale, promotional programs, and drinker education and engagement.

The Company’s beverages are sold by the Company’s sales force to the same types of customers and drinkers in similar size quantities, at similar price points and through substantially the same channels of distribution. These beverages are manufactured using similar production processes, have comparable alcohol content and generally fall within the same regulatory environment.

The Company’s strategy is to create and offer a world-class variety of traditional and innovative alcohol beverages. The Company’s primary brands which include the Truly Hard Seltzer, Twisted Tea, Samuel Adams, Angry Orchard and Dogfish Head brands are all available nationally. In 2016, the Company began national distribution of the Truly Hard Seltzer brand and it maintained its place as one of the leading brands in the hard seltzer category in 2021. The Twisted Tea brand family has grown each year since the product was first introduced in 2001 and has established a loyal drinker following and during 2021 became the largest selling flavored malt beverage brand. The Samuel Adams brand began in 1984 and the brand is recognized as one of the largest and most respected craft beer brands with a particular focus on lagers and seasonal beers. The Angry Orchard brand was launched in 2011 and since 2013, Angry Orchard has been the largest selling hard cider in the United States. The Dogfish Head brand began in 1995 and is recognized as one of the most innovative and respected craft beer and spirits brand with a particular focus on India Pale Ales (“IPAs”), sour beers and spirits RTDs. In addition to its primary brands the Company has two local brewery brands, Angel City® and Coney Island®, that primarily focus on tap rooms and local and regional distribution.

The Company sells its beverages in various packages. Sleek cans, standard cans and bottles are sold primarily for off-premise retailers, which include grocery stores, club stores, convenience stores, liquor stores, and other traditional and e-commerce retail outlets. Kegs are sold primarily for on-premise retailers, which include bars, restaurants, stadiums and other venues.
 
In the second half of 2021, the Company entered separate licensing agreements with PepsiCo, Inc. (“Pepsi”), Jim Beam Brands Co. (“Jim Beam”) and Patagonia Provisions, Inc. (“Patagonia”) to develop, market and sell alcohol beverages. While the Company believes these agreements represent important strategic opportunities to increase volume in the longer term, the Company currently forecasts these combined new brands will be less than 4% of net revenue in 2022.
 
Under the Pepsi agreement, the Company is responsible for developing, manufacturing, and marketing a flavored malt beverage product under Pepsi’s MTN DEW® brand. The Company began shipping beverages to customers under this agreement in early 2022.


Under the first of two Jim Beam agreements, the Company is responsible for developing and bringing to market through its distribution network one or more flavored malt beverage products under brand name(s) from the Jim Beam portfolio, beginning with the Sauza brand. Under the second Jim Beam agreement, Jim Beam is responsible for developing and bringing to market through its distribution network one or more full bottled distilled spirits products under brand(s) from the Company’s portfolio, beginning with the Truly brand. The parties expect to begin shipping beverages to customers under these agreements in the first quarter of 2022.
 
Under the Patagonia agreement, the Company is responsible for developing, manufacturing, and marketing a cobranded Dogfish Head and Patagonia beer which it expects to begin shipping late in the first quarter of 2022.
 
Truly Hard Seltzer
 
The Company’s Truly Hard Seltzer brand generally compete within the hard seltzer category that has similar characteristics to the beer industry for reporting and regulatory purposes. This category grew rapidly in the early stages of its development over the last 6 years and is highly competitive and includes large international and domestic competitors as well as many smaller national, regional and local craft breweries and hard seltzer companies. The Company believes that the hard seltzer category comprises approximately 8% of United States beer consumption and that the volume comprising the hard seltzer category grew approximately 158% in 2020 and 13% in 2021. This slowdown in growth between 2020 and 2021 significantly impacted the Company's business during 2021.
 
The Company offers over thirty styles of hard seltzer in the Truly brand family, most of which are available nationally in the United States. The majority of the promotional and distribution efforts for the Truly brand family are focused on sleek can variety packages which include Truly Lemonade Seltzer Mix Pack, Truly Berry Mix Pack, Truly Tropical Mix Pack, Truly Citrus Mix Pack, Truly Fruit Punch Mix Pack, Truly Margarita Style Mix Pack and Truly Iced Tea Seltzer Mix Pack.
 
Twisted Tea
 
The Company’s Twisted Tea products generally compete within the flavored malt beverage (“FMB”) category of the beer industry (and the Company’s Twisted Tea products are included in generic references to the Company’s “beers” in this report). The Company believes that the FMB category comprises approximately 5% of United States beer consumption and that the volume comprising the FMB category grew approximately 3% in 2021. This category is highly competitive due to, among other factors, the presence of large brewers and spirits companies in the category and a fast pace of product innovation.

The Company offers over ten styles of flavored malt beverages in the Twisted Tea brand family, most of which are available nationally in both the United States and Canada. The majority of the promotional and distribution efforts for the Twisted Tea brand family are focused on Twisted Tea Original and Twisted Tea Half and Half in various standard can packages.

Samuel Adams and Dogfish Head Beers
 
The Company’s Samuel Adams and Dogfish Head beers generally compete within the craft beer and domestic specialty beer category. The Company believes that the category comprises approximately 6% of United States beer consumption and that the volume comprising the category declined approximately 6% in 2021. This category is highly competitive and includes large international and domestic competitors, as well as many smaller national, regional and local craft breweries.
 
The Company offers over twenty styles of beer in the Samuel Adams brand family and the brand is recognized for helping launch the craft beer industry. Samuel Adams Boston Lager® is the Company’s flagship beer that was introduced in 1984.

The Samuel Adams Seasonal program of beers was originally introduced in the late 1980’s and includes various limited availability seasonal beers and variety packs.

The majority of the promotional and distribution efforts for the Samuel Adams brand family are focused on Samuel Adams Boston Lager, the Samuel Adams Seasonal program, Samuel Adams Wicked Hazy IPA and Samuel Adams Wicked Easy. These beers are available nationally in various bottle, standard can and keg packages.

The Samuel Adams brand also releases a variety of specialty package and draft beers brewed in limited quantities at its Samuel Adams Downtown Boston Tap Room, Samuel Adams Boston Brewery Tap Room and Samuel Adams Cincinnati Brewery Tap Room.


The Company offers over twenty-five styles of beer in the Dogfish Head brand family. The Dogfish Head brand began in 1993 and it is recognized as an early leader in bringing culinary innovations to the U.S. craft beer market. The majority of the promotional and distribution efforts for the Dogfish Head brand family are focused on continually-hopped Dogfish Head 60 Minute and 90 Minute IPAs, along with Dogfish Head Hazy-O, a juicy hazy IPA and seasonal variety packs. These styles are offered in various can, bottle and keg packages. The Dogfish Head brand also releases a variety of specialty package and draft beers brewed in limited quantities at its Dogfish Head Brewings and Eats and Milton tasting room locations. The Company does not own distribution rights to the Dogfish Head beer and distilled spirits brands outside of the United States and Canada.

Angry Orchard Hard Cider
 
The Company’s Angry Orchard ciders compete within the hard cider category that has similar characteristics to the beer industry. The Company believes that the hard cider category comprises less than 1% of United States beer consumption and that the volume comprising the category declined 8% in 2021. This category is small and highly competitive and includes large international and domestic competitors, as well as many small regional and local hard cider companies.
   The Company offers over ten styles of hard cider in the Angry Orchard brand family, most of which are available nationally in the United States in various bottle, can and keg packages. The majority of the promotional and distribution efforts for the Angry Orchard brand family are focused on Angry Orchard Crisp Apple, Angry Orchard Crisp Unfiltered, Angry Orchard Strawberry Fruit Cider and Angry Orchard Peach Mango Fruit Cider. The Angry Orchard brand also releases a variety of specialty package and draft ciders fermented in limited quantities at its Company-owned Orchard and Cidery in Walden, New York.
Dogfish Head Spirits and Spirit RTDs
    The Dogfish Head brand began distilling spirits in 2002 and is considered one of the original craft distilleries. The Company offers over 15 styles of distilled spirits under the Dogfish Head brand in small quantities that are sold in limited markets. In 2021, the Company entered the market for spirits RTDs through its Dogfish Head brand. The Company believes that the spirits RTD category comprises less than 5% of United States Beyond Beer market and that the dollar value comprising the category increased 118% in 2021. This category is small and highly competitive and includes large international and domestic competitors, as well as many small regional and local craft distilling companies.
 
The Company currently offers five styles of spirits RTDs under the Dogfish Head brand that are available nationally in sleek can and sleek can variety packages.
 
The Company continually evaluates the performance of its beverages and the rationalization of its product lines as a whole. Periodically, the Company discontinues certain styles and packages. Certain styles or brands put on hiatus or discontinued in previous years may be produced for the Company’s variety packs or reintroduced.

Product Innovations

The Company has a proven track record of innovation and building new brands and is committed to maintaining its position as a leading innovator. To that end, the Company continually tests new alcohol beverages and may sell them under various brand labels for evaluation of drinker interest. The Boston Brewery, the Milton Brewery and the Orchard, along with its other larger breweries and brewery tap rooms spend significant time ideating, testing and developing alcohol beverages for the Company’s potential future commercial development and evaluating ingredients and process improvements for existing beverages.

The Company’s most significant innovations in 2021 were the national launches of the Truly Fruit Punch Mix Pack and Truly Iced Tea Seltzer Mix Pack. Both new Truly Mix Packs were among the top introductions in the Hard Seltzer Category during 2021 and include innovative hard seltzers with robust flavors, 100 calories and 1 gram of sugar. The Company also introduced five styles of spirits RTDs under the Dogfish Head brand, two Angry Orchard fruit ciders and two non-alcoholic beers under the Samuel Adams and Dogfish Head brands. In late 2021 the Company introduced the Truly Margarita Style Mix Pack and Bevy Long Drink in limited markets and has since launched these innovations nationally in early 2022. Bevy Long Drink is a Finish cocktail-inspired malt beverage made with citrus flavors.
 

The Company has plans for several new product introductions in 2022, of which the most significant include Hard Mountain Dew and Sauza Agave Cocktails. The Company is currently in the early stages of these introductions.
 
In May 2021, the Company announced that it is establishing a subsidiary to serve as a dedicated research and innovation hub in the federally regulated market of Canada focused on non-alcoholic cannabis beverages. This new subsidiary will enable the company to develop and pilot unique cannabis beverages while cannabis regulations continue to evolve in the United States and worldwide. The Company expects to begin selling limited quantities of cannabis beverage products in Canada during the third quarter of 2022. The Company currently does not have plans to produce or sell any cannabis products outside of Canada.
 
Sales, Distribution and Marketing

As dictated by the legal and regulatory environment, most all the Company’s sales are made to a network of over 400 wholesalers in the United States and to a network of foreign wholesalers, importers or other agencies (collectively referred to as “Distributors”). These Distributors, in turn, sell the products to retailers, such as grocery stores, club stores, convenience stores, liquor stores, bars, restaurants, stadiums and other traditional and e-commerce retail outlets, where the products are sold to drinkers, and in some limited circumstances to parties who act as sub-distributors. The Company sells its products predominantly in the United States, but also has markets in Canada, Europe, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean, the Pacific Rim, Mexico, and Central and South America.

With few exceptions, the Company’s products are not the primary brands in its Distributors’ portfolios. Thus, the Company, in addition to competing with other beverages for a share of the drinker’s business, competes with other brewers for a share of the Distributor’s attention, time and selling efforts. During 2021, the Company’s largest individual Distributor accounted for approximately 2% of the Company’s gross sales. The top three individual Distributors collectively accounted for approximately 5% of the Company’s gross sales. In some states and countries, the Company’s contracts with its Distributors may be affected by laws that restrict the enforcement of some contract terms, especially those related to the Company’s right to terminate the relationship.

Historically, most of the Company’s products were shipped within days of packaging, resulting in limited finished goods at the Company’s breweries and third-party breweries. The Company received most of its orders from Distributors in the first week of a month for products to be shipped the following month. Distributors would carry three to five weeks of packaged inventory and three to four weeks of draft inventory and the Company was able to meet Distributor orders with limited out of stocks.

Beginning in 2019, primarily as a result of higher than anticipated demand for the Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands and supply chain constraints, the Company began to have out of stocks and at times was not able to fully meet Distributor demand, particularly at seasonal peaks during the summer months. In response to these out of stocks, the Company began working with certain Distributors on plans to increase Distributor inventories of packaged inventory of Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands to ensure that drinker demand could be met. In the second half of 2021 as the hard seltzer category slowed significantly more than industry expectations, both Company inventory and distributors inventory in terms of days on hand increased above historical levels. This resulted in write-offs of excess inventory at the Company’s breweries and warehouses and lower orders as distributors aggressively reduced distributor inventory levels. This reduction of distributor inventory levels resulted in a shipment volume decline of 24.5% during the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, despite depletions increasing by 15% during the same period.

The Company believes distributor inventory as of December 25, 2021 averaged approximately 5 weeks on hand and was at an appropriate overall level but included too much inventory for some packages and not enough for others. The Company expects distributors will keep inventory levels below 2021 levels in terms of weeks on hand, as the need for peak season inventory prebuilds is greatly reduced due to the Company's increased production capacity. As a result, the Company expects shipments will continue to decline in the first quarter of 2022 and then grow in the second quarter compared to 2021.

Boston Beer has a sales force of approximately 520 people, which the Company believes is one of the largest in the domestic beer industry. The Company’s sales organization is designed to develop and strengthen relations at the Distributor, retailer and drinker levels by providing educational and promotional programs. The Company’s sales force has a high level of product knowledge and is trained in the details of the brewing and selling processes. Sales representatives typically carry samples of the Company’s beverages, certain ingredients, and other promotional materials to educate wholesale and retail buyers about the quality and taste of the Company’s products. The Company has developed strong relationships with its Distributors and retailers, many of which have benefited from the Company’s premium pricing strategy and growth.


The Company also engages in media campaigns — including television, digital and social media, radio, billboards and print. These media efforts are complemented by participation in sponsorships, which currently include, the National Hockey League, the Boston Red Sox and other professional sports teams, the Boston Marathon, local concert and festivals, industry-related trade shows and promotional events at local establishments, to the extent permitted under local laws and regulations. The Company uses a wide array of point-of-sale items (banners, neon signs, umbrellas, glassware, display pieces, signs and menu stands) designed to stimulate impulse sales and continued awareness.

COVID-19
 
Many public reports indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic may be slowly winding down. Still, the Company’s primary focus continues to be on operating its breweries and business safely and working hard to meet customer demand. The Company began seeing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business in early March 2020. The direct financial impact of the pandemic primarily included significantly reduced keg demand from the On-Premise channel and higher labor and safety-related costs at the Company’s breweries, and at times reduced ability to staff its production and distribution facilities. In addition to these direct financial impacts, COVID-19 related safety measures resulted in a reduction of brewery productivity, with more volume shifted to third-party breweries, increasing production costs and negatively impacting gross margins. In the 52-week period ended December 26, 2020, the Company recorded COVID-19 related pre-tax reductions in net revenue and increases in other costs that total $16.0 million, of which $1.8 million was recorded in the fourth quarter. The total amount consists of a $3.3 million reduction in net revenue for estimated keg returns from distributors and retailers and $12.7 million of other COVID-19 related direct costs. In 2021 and going forward, the Company has chosen not to report COVID-19 related direct costs separately, as they are viewed to be a normal part of operations in today's environment.
 
Packaging and Ingredients
 
Historically, the Company has been successful in obtaining sufficient quantities of the packaging materials and ingredients used in the production of its beverages. During 2020 and 2021, the Company experienced some can, cardboard wraps and glass shortages that impacted the Company’s production schedules. The Company enters into limited-term supply agreements with certain vendors in order to receive preferential pricing. The Company maintains competitive sources for most all packaging materials and ingredients. In 2021, certain flavorings, crowns and labels were each supplied by a single source; however, the Company believes that, given time to adjust, alternative suppliers are available. The most significant packaging and ingredients include:

Cans. Truly Hard Seltzer brand beverages are primarily packaged in sleek cans and Twisted Tea brand beverages are primarily packaged in standard cans. In 2021, over 75% of the Company’s total volume was packaged in cans and the Company expects that percentage to increase further in 2022. The demand for cans in the beverage industry has significantly increased and there has been a shortage of capacity, as can manufacturers attempt to adjust their supply chains to keep up with the increased demand which had further accelerated beginning in 2020 as the category grew household penetration and alcohol consumption shifted from on-premise to off-premise. In 2020 and 2021, as the Truly brand family and the Twisted brand families had grown significantly, the Company experienced supply shortages and these supply shortages impacted the Company’s production schedules. The Company is working closely with its can suppliers to ensure there are no further supply disruptions and that the Company has an adequate supply.

Flavorings. The Company’s beverages include many unique and proprietary flavors and combinations of flavors and some of these flavorings are single sourced. Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brand beverages are particularly reliant on the use of flavorings and variety of flavors as part of their appeal to drinkers. The Company is working closely with various flavoring suppliers to ensure it has an adequate supply and currently believes that it will have sufficient supply of flavorings in 2022.

Cardboard. The Company’s beverages are packaged primarily in cardboard wraps, carriers and cardboard shipping cases. During 2020 the Company had a disruption to its supply of cardboard wraps which impacted its production schedules. The Company is working closely with its various cardboard suppliers to ensure the Company has an adequate supply and there are no further disruptions. The Company currently believes that it will have a sufficient supply of cardboard in 2022.
 
Glass. Many of the Company’s beverages are sold primarily in glass bottles. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for glass bottles in the beverage industry has significantly increased and there has been a shortage of capacity, as glass manufacturers attempt to adjust their supply chains to keep up with the increased demand. The most recent disruption was during the fourth quarter of 2020, which impacted production schedules. The Company currently believes that it will have a sufficient supply of glass in 2022.
 

Malt. The two-row varieties of barley used in the Company’s malt are mainly grown in the United States and Canada. The 2021 North American barley crop, which will support 2022 malt needs, was generally consistent with historical long-term averages with regard to both quality and quantity. The Company purchased most of the malt used in the production of its beers from four suppliers during 2021. The Company currently has a multi-year contract with one of its suppliers and a one-year agreement with another supplier. The Company also believes that there are other malt suppliers available that are capable of supplying its needs.

Hops. The Company uses Noble hop varieties from Europe for many of its Samuel Adams beers and also uses hops grown in other areas of Europe, the United States, and New Zealand. Noble hops are grown in several specific areas in Germany and the Czech Republic and are recognized for growing hops with superior taste and aroma properties. The Company uses hops in various formats including T-90 hop pellets, T-45 hop pellets and CO2 Extract. The Company stores its hops in multiple cold storage warehouses to minimize the impact of a catastrophe at a single site.
 
The Company enters into purchase commitments with nine primary hop dealers and attempts to maintain a one to two-year supply of essential hop varieties on-hand in order to limit the risk of an unexpected reduction in supply and procures hops needed for new beers, based on its best estimate of likely short-term demand. The Company classifies hops inventory in excess of two years of forecasted usage as other long term assets.

Variations to usage plans could result in hops shortages for specific beers or an excess of certain hops varieties.

Yeast. The Company uses multiple yeast strains for production of its beverages. While some strains are commercially available, other strains are proprietary. Since the proprietary strains cannot be replaced if destroyed, the Company protects these strains by storing multiple cultures of the same strain at different production locations and in several independent laboratories.

Apples. The Company uses special varieties and origins of apples in its hard ciders that it believes are important for their flavor profiles. In 2021, these apples were sourced primarily from Europe and the United States and include bittersweet apples from France and culinary apples from Italy, Washington State and New York. Purchases and commitments are denominated in Euros for European apples and US Dollars for United States apples. There is limited availability of some of these apple varieties, and many outside factors, including weather conditions, growers rotating from apples to other crops, competitor demand, government regulation and legislation affecting agriculture could affect both price and supply.
 
Quality Assurance

The Company employs brewmasters to monitor the Company’s brewing operations and control the production of its beverages both at Company-owned breweries and at the third-party breweries at which the Company’s products are brewed, fermented or distilled. Extensive tests, tastings and evaluations are typically required to ensure that each batch of the Company’s beverages conforms to the Company’s standards. The Company has on-site quality control labs at each of the Company-owned breweries and supports the smaller tap rooms and local breweries with additional centralized lab services.

With the exception of certain specialty products, the Company includes a clearly legible “freshness” date on every bottle, can and keg of its beverages, in order to ensure that its drinkers enjoy only the freshest products. Boston Beer was the first American brewer to use this practice.

Production Strategy

The Company continues to pursue a production strategy that includes production at breweries owned by the Company and breweries and packaging facilities owned by others. During 2020 and 2021, the Company brewed, fermented and packaged approximately 65% and 56% of its volume at breweries owned by the Company, respectively. The Company made capital investments in 2021 of approximately $147.9 million, most of which represented investments in the Company’s breweries. These investments were made to increase production, drive efficiencies and cost reductions and support product innovation and future growth. Based on its current estimates of future volumes and mix, the Company expects to invest between $140 million and $190 million in 2022 to meet those estimates. Because actual capital investments are highly dependent on meeting demand, the actual amount spent may well be significantly different from the Company’s current expectations.

The Pennsylvania Brewery, the Cincinnati Brewery and the Milton Brewery produced most of the Company’s shipment volume from breweries owned by the Company during 2021. The Pennsylvania Brewery is the Company’s largest brewery.
 

Production and retail activities at the Company's local breweries and tap rooms, are mainly for brewing and packaging beers for retail sales on site at tap rooms and gift shops, restaurant activities, developing innovative and traditional beers and in some cases supporting draft and package accounts in the respective local market areas.

The Cidery’s production is mainly for developing new types of innovative hard ciders and fermenting and packaging ciders for retail sales on site at the Cidery and supporting draft and package accounts in the local market area.
   In 2021, as a result of lower than anticipated demand for certain Truly brand styles and packages, the Company adjusted its volume plans for production at certain third-party facilities. The Company terminated relationships with some of its third-party production suppliers and recorded $19.6 million of costs related to terminating these contracts. In addition, the Company wrote off $9.5 million of amounts prepaid pursuant to a third-party production agreement that the Company has no future plans to utilize.
    The Company currently has a brewing and packaging services agreement with subsidiaries of City Brewing Company, LLC (“City Brewing”). During 2020 and 2021, City Brewing supplied approximately 33% and 32% of the Company’s annual shipment volume, respectively. In accordance with the brewing and packaging services agreement, the Company has paid to City Brewing $113.4 million for capital improvements at City Brewing facilities and other pre-payments. The agreement includes a minimum capacity availability commitment by City Brewing and the Company is obligated to meet annual minimum volume commitments and is subject to contractual shortfall fees if these annual minimum volume commitments are not met. The Company has the contractual right to extend its agreement with City Brewing beyond the December 31, 2024 termination date on an annual basis through December 31, 2035.

In 2021, the Company entered into a production agreement with Rauch North America (“Rauch”). The agreement includes a minimum capacity availability commitment by Rauch and the Company is obligated to meet annual minimum volume commitments and is subject to contractual shortfall fees if these annual minimum volume commitments are not met. There was no production in 2021 and it will commence in 2022. The initial term of the contract expires December 31, 2031 with provisions to extend.
 
At current production volume projections, the Company believes that it will fall short of its future annual volume commitments at certain third-party production facilities, including the agreements described above, and will incur shortfall fees. The Company will expense the shortfall fees during the contractual period when such fees are incurred as a component of cost of goods sold. As of December 25, 2021, if volume for the remaining term of the production arrangements were zero, the contractual shortfall fees would total approximately $210 million over the duration of the contracts which have expiration dates through December 31, 2031. In lieu of contractual shortfall fees, the Company terminated certain of its third-party production contracts for $7.1 million, with those costs recognized in contract terminations costs and other for the year ended December 25, 2021. At current production volume projections, the Company anticipates that it will recognize approximately $38 million of additional shortfall fees and expects to record those expenses as follows over the five subsequent years:

The Company currently expects that the percentage of total production at breweries and packaging facilities owned by others will be approximately 30% in 2022. The Company carefully selects breweries and packaging facilities owned by others with one or more of: (i) sleek can packaging and automated variety packaging capability and capacity; (ii) first-rate quality control capabilities throughout the process; and (iii) the capability of utilizing traditional brewing, fermenting and finishing methods. Under its brewing and packaging arrangements with third parties, the Company is charged a service fee based on units produced at each of the facilities and bears the costs of raw materials, risk, excise taxes and deposits for pallets and kegs and specialized equipment required to produce and package the Company’s beverages.

The Company’s international business is supplied by breweries owned by the Company, under third-party brewing and packaging agreements, and production under license at international locations.


While the Company believes that it has alternatives available to it, in the event that production at any of its current locations is interrupted, severe interruptions at the Pennsylvania Brewery or City Brewing facilities would be most problematic, especially in seasonal peak periods. In addition, the Company may not be able to maintain its current economics, if interruptions were to occur, and could face significant delays in starting up replacement production locations. Potential interruptions at breweries include labor issues, governmental actions, quality issues, contractual disputes, machinery failures, operational shutdowns, or natural or other unavoidable catastrophes. Also, as the brewing industry has consolidated and the Company has grown, the capacity and willingness of breweries owned by others where the Company could produce some of its beverages, if necessary, has become a more significant concern. The Company would work with available contract brewers to attempt to minimize any potential disruptions.

Competition

The High End and Beyond Beer categories within the United States are highly competitive due to large domestic and international brewers and the increasing number of craft brewers and craft distilleries in this category who distribute similar products that have similar pricing and target drinkers.

The two largest brewers in the United States, AB InBev and Molson Coors, participate actively in the High End and Beyond Beer categories, through numerous launches of new hard seltzers and spirit RTDs from existing beer brands or new brands, importing and distributing import brands, and with their own domestic specialty beers, either by developing new brands or by acquiring, in whole or part, existing brands. In addition, AB InBev’s High End Division and Molson Coors’ Tenth and Blake were formed as business units headquartered in the United States that are focused exclusively on competing in the High End and Beyond Beer categories. Imported beers, such as Corona®, Heineken®, Modelo Especial® and Stella Artois®, continue to compete aggressively in the United States and have gained market share over the last ten years. Heineken and Constellation Brands (owner of the United States Distribution rights to Corona and Modelo Especial) may have substantially greater financial resources, marketing strength and distribution networks than the Company.

More recently in 2021 and entering 2022, large non-alcoholic beverage companies including Pepsi, Coca-Cola Company (“Coke") and Monster Beverage Corporation (“Monster”) have begun to enter these markets through licensing agreements with alcoholic beverage companies to develop alcohol versions of existing traditional non-alcohol brands or, in the case of Monster, the acquisition of the CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective in early 2022. Coke has entered into agreements with Molson Coors to develop, market and sell Topo Chico brand Hard Seltzer. Coke also announced agreements with Constellation to develop, market and sell FRESCA Mixed, a line of spirits RTDs. As previously discussed, the Company has entered into an agreement with Pepsi to develop, market and sell alcohol beverages which include Hard Mountain Dew, to take advantage of this trend.
 
The Company’s Truly Hard Seltzer beverages compete primarily within the hard seltzer category of the beer industry. This category has been growing quickly since 2016, is highly competitive and includes large international and domestic competitors. Hard seltzers are typically priced competitively with High End beers and may compete for drinkers with beer, wine, spirits, or FMBs. Some of these competitors include Mark Anthony Brands under the brand name “White Claw”, “Mikes Hard Lemonade Seltzer”; ABInBev under “Bud Light Seltzer”, “Michelob Ultra Organic Seltzer”, “Natural Light Seltzer” and “Bon & Viv’s”; Diageo under “Smirnoff Spiked Sparkling Seltzer”; and Molson Coors under “Vizzy Hard Sparkling Water” and "Topo Chico". The Company expects additional entrants in the hard seltzer category during 2022 from both large and smaller international and domestic competitors, as the category continues to develop distribution and drinker awareness. Most significantly, Mark Anthony Brands announced that during 2022 it will launch nationally two new hard seltzer brand line extensions, “White Claw REFRSHR” and “White Claw Surge.”
 
The Company’s Twisted Tea beverages compete primarily within the FMB category of the beer industry. FMBs, such as Twisted Tea, Mike’s Hard Lemonade®, Smirnoff Ice®, Bud Light Lime® Ritas, Redd’s® Apple Ale, Seagrams Escapes® and Arnold Palmer Spiked, are flavored malt beverages that are typically priced competitively with High End beers. As noted earlier, this category is highly competitive due to, among other factors, the presence of large brewers and spirits companies in the category, the advertising of malt-based spirits brands in channels not available to the parent brands and a fast pace of product innovation.
 
The Company’s Samuel Adams and Dogfish Head beverages compete primarily within the craft beer and domestic specialty beer category of the beer industry. The Company expects competition and innovation among domestic craft brewers to remain strong, as the number of craft brewers continues to grow. The Company estimates there are over 8,000 breweries in operation, up from approximately 1,500 operating breweries in 2009. Most of these new breweries are craft (small and independent) brewers. Also, some existing craft breweries are building more capacity, adding additional local tap rooms, expanding geographically and adding more SKUs and styles.


There have been numerous announcements of acquisitions of or investments in craft brewers by larger breweries and private equity and other investors. The most significant acquisitions include Heineken’s acquisition of Lagunitas Brewing Company for approximately $1 billion, AB InBev’s purchase of multiple craft breweries, including Craft Brew Alliance, Elysian Brewing Company, Golden Road Brewing, Four Peaks Brewing Company, Breckenridge Brewing, Devils Backbone, Karbach, Wicked Weed, and Platform Beer, and Molson Coors’ purchase of multiple craft breweries, including Hop Valley Brewing and Revolver Brewing.

The Company’s Angry Orchard product line competes within the hard cider category. As noted earlier, this category is small and highly competitive and includes large international and domestic competitors, as well as many small regional and local hard cider companies. Hard ciders are typically priced competitively with High End Beers and may compete for drinkers with beer, wine, spirits, or FMBs. Some of these competitors include C&C Group PLC under the brand names "Magners" and "Hornsby’s"; Heineken under the brand names "Strongbow"; and AB InBev under "Stella Cidre". In recent years, regional and local cideries, including "Bold Rock","2 Towns" and "Austin East Ciders", have built businesses that have gained share locally at the expense of the national brands.

The Company’s Dogfish Head RTDs compete in the spirits RTDs category. As noted earlier, this category is small and highly competitive and includes large international and domestic competitors, as well as many small regional and local distilling companies. Spirits RTDs are typically priced above High End Beers and may compete for drinkers with beer, wine, spirits, or FMBs. Some of these competitors include E&J Gallo Winery under the brand name "High Noon"; ABInBev under the brand name "Cutwater" and Geloso Beverages under the brand name "Clubtails".
 
The Company’s products also compete with other alcoholic beverages for drinker attention and consumption and the pace of innovation in the categories in which the Company competes is increasing. In recent years, wine and spirits have been competing more directly with beers. The Company monitors such activity and attempts to develop strategies which benefit from the drinker’s interest in trading up, in order to position its beverages competitively with wine and spirits.

The Company competes with other beer and alcoholic beverage companies within a three-tier distribution system. The Company competes for a share of the Distributor’s attention, time and selling efforts. At retail, the Company competes for traditional retail shelf, cold box and tap space, as well as e-commerce placement. From a drinker perspective, competition exists for brand acceptance and loyalty. The principal factors of competition in the market for High End beer and Beyond Beer occasions include product quality and taste, brand advertising and imagery, trade and drinker promotions, pricing, packaging and the development of innovative new products.

The Company distributes its products through independent Distributors who also distribute competitors’ products. Certain brewers have contracts with their Distributors that impose requirements on the Distributors that are intended to maximize the Distributors’ attention, time and selling efforts on that brewer’s products. These contracts generally result in increased competition among brewers as the contracts may affect the manner in which a Distributor allocates selling effort and investment to the brands included in its portfolio. The Company closely monitors these and other trends in its Distributor network and works to develop programs and tactics intended to best position its products in the market.

The Company has certain competitive advantages over other brewers and competitors, including a long history of awards for product quality, greater available resources and the ability to distribute and promote its products on a more cost-effective basis. Additionally, the Company believes it has competitive advantages over imported beers, including lower transportation costs, higher product quality, a lack of import charges and superior product freshness.
 
Regulation and Taxation
 
The alcoholic beverage industry is regulated by federal, state and local governments. These regulations govern the production, sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages, including permitting, licensing, marketing and advertising. To operate its production facilities, the Company must obtain and maintain numerous permits, licenses and approvals from various governmental agencies, including but not limited to, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (the “TTB”), the Food and Drug Administration, state alcohol regulatory agencies and state and federal environmental agencies.

Governmental entities may levy various taxes, license fees and other similar charges and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Beginning in 2018, as a result of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”, the Company’s federal excise tax rate on hard seltzer and beer decreased from $18 to $16 per barrel on all barrels below 6 million barrels produced annually. The top tier rate on hard cider (with alcohol by volume of 8.5% or less) is $0.226 per gallon, on hard cider (with non-qualifying fermentable fruits) is $1.07 per gallon, on artificially carbonated wine (hard cider

with high CO2 levels) is $3.30 per gallon, and on distilled spirits is $13.50 per proof gallon. States levy excise taxes at varying rates based on the type of beverage and alcohol content. Failure by the Company to comply with applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations could result in higher taxes, penalties, fees and suspension or revocation of permits, licenses or approvals. While there can be no assurance that any such regulatory action would not have a material adverse effect upon the Company or its operating results, the Company is not aware of any infraction affecting any of its licenses or permits that would materially impact its ability to continue its current operations.
 
Trademarks
 
The Company has obtained trademark registrations with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for over 400 trademarks, including Samuel Adams®, Sam Adams®, Twisted Tea®, Truly®, Truly Hard Seltzer®, Angry Orchard®, Dogfish Head®, Coney Island®, and Angel City Brewery®. It also has a number of common law trademarks. Several Company trademarks are also registered or have registrations pending in various foreign countries. The Company regards its trademarks as having substantial value and as being an important factor in the marketing of its products. The Company is not aware of any trademark infringements that could materially affect its current business or any prior claim to the trademarks that would prevent the Company from using such trademarks in its business. The Company’s policy is to pursue registration of its marks whenever appropriate and to oppose infringements of its marks through available enforcement options.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations and Operating Considerations

The Company’s operations are subject to a variety of extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances that govern activities or operations that may have adverse effects on human health or the environment. Environmental laws, regulations or ordinances may impose liability for the cost of remediation of, and for certain damages resulting from, sites of past releases of hazardous materials. The Company believes that it currently conducts, and in the past has conducted, its activities and operations in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws, and believes that any costs arising from existing environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
 
As part of its efforts to be environmentally responsible, the Company has adopted a number of practices designed to improve recycling, waste reduction, and utilities consumption at its breweries.
 
The Company has adopted various policies and procedures intended to ensure that its facilities meet occupational health and safety requirements. The Company believes that it currently is in compliance with applicable requirements and will continue to endeavor to remain in compliance. There can be no assurances, however, that new and more restrictive requirements might not be adopted, compliance with which might have a material, adverse financial effect on the Company and its operating results, or that such policies and procedures will be consistently followed and be sufficient to prevent serious accidents.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 25, 2021, the Company had 2,543 employees, of which 132 were represented by unions or similar organizations. The Company’s Executive Leadership Team (“ELT”) is comprised of our CEO and 6 of his direct reports who collectively have management responsibility for our primary business areas, including but not limited to brewing, supply chain operations, sales, marketing, finance, and people and culture. The Company’s Board of Directors and the ELT believe that succession planning, talent management, culture, and diversity, equity, and inclusion are critical to the Company’s continued success.
Succession Planning and Talent Management
 
The Company regularly reviews talent development and succession plans for each of its functional areas to identify and develop a pipeline of talent to maintain business operations. The Company understands the potential costs and risks of bringing in an outside executive officer in today’s environment, and that businesses are often – but not always – more successful in promoting internal candidates. Accordingly, the Board of Directors and the ELT make efforts to identify potential successors for those positions long in advance of any potential positional vacancies, perform skills gap analyses for those internal candidates, and provide training and exposure on those gap areas to those candidates in order to develop better potential successors. The Board of Directors is primarily responsible for succession planning for the CEO, but also participates in succession planning discussions for other executive officer positions. The Company believes that its culture, compensation structure, long-term equity program, and robust training and development program provide motivation for talented leaders to remain with the Company.
Culture
 
The ELT discusses culture with its employees and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. The Company is continuously focused on developing an inclusive and respectful work environment, where all employees at every level should feel empowered to honestly “discuss the undiscussables” with other employees at any level, all the way up to the Chairman and the CEO, without fear of retribution or retaliation. The Chairman teaches this philosophy during orientation to all new employees, and each company-wide meeting has time set aside to discuss the undiscussables. Additionally, each year the Board meets with a set of key senior managers, without the ELT present, so that the Board may seek direct feedback on the Company, its practices, culture, and employee benefits and programs.

The Company also fosters a culture of ongoing training and education. Some examples of trainings provided to employees include New Employee Orientation, Respectful and Effective Communications, Leading the Boston Beer Company Way, Selling Skills, Negotiations, and Building Brands. Employees also receive beer and cider education training during New Employee Orientation. Then, after having been with the Company for one year, employees are encouraged to participate in further beer and cider education courses where they can train to be certified as industry experts in those areas. The Company believes that it has the most beer industry experts, called “Certified Cicerones,” in the beer industry.

In October 2020, the Company rolled out a formal mentoring and leadership program to connect dozens of senior and junior employees across a range of backgrounds with the purpose of diversifying perspectives, building networks, developing capabilities, growing competencies, and cultivating leadership.

The Company also regularly conducts internal engagement surveys of its employee base to help ensure that it is maintaining its culture. In 2021, over 80% of employees participated in the survey, which resulted in high scores in response to the questions related to pride in working for the Company, believing in the Company’s values, the Company’s concern for employee safety, personal well-being, and diversity, confidence in the future of the Company, and pride in the Company’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
 
As an equal opportunity employer, the Company is committed to creating a diverse and fair-minded organization that recognizes and values differences - inclusive of race, color, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, age, and mental/physical disability. The Company makes these efforts to reinforce a workplace that supports and uplifts coworkers to feel accepted, equal, and involved, and to increase diverse representation across our organization, which is critical to continued success. Over the past three years, the Company has taken numerous steps in furtherance of this goal:
 
•Diversity and inclusion was the sole focus of the Company's annual “Action Learning Project” in 2019, where a cross-functional group of high-potential employees is formed annually to tackle an issue of vital importance to the Company. The Action Learning Project Group met every week for over ten months, identifying potential solutions to improve diversity across the Company. The group presented its findings and proposed solutions to the Executive Leadership Team and a leadership group consisting of the Company’s key senior managers in late 2019. 
 •The Company created a Coworker Resource Group platform in 2019 designed to provide a community to connect with coworkers on shared affinities and educate others who want to learn. The Company currently has seven coworker resource groups focused in the areas LGBTQIA+, working families, veterans, drug and alcohol support, sustainability, women's support, and multicultural representation. 
 •Since 2019 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion has been an area of discussion at our National Company Meetings. 
 •In early 2020, the “Action Learning Project” project evolved into the creation of a Diversity & Inclusion Committee. The goal of the committee was to continue to advance efforts of fostering open dialogue about diversity, equity, and inclusion, to ensure sustained awareness and growth. 
 •In late 2020, the Company appointed a coworker to the newly created full-time position of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Leader to spearhead the Company’s DEI efforts. The position also serves as a member of the Company’s Social Impact Team.
 •In 2020 the Company formed a multi-cultural task force, comprised of a cross-functional group of coworkers, to analyze and support the evolving makeup and needs of the Company’s consumer base. Over the course of year, the Company leveraged its brands as external platforms to amplify these values and support social causes.
 •The Company established long-term relationships in 2020 with the NAACP, Civic Alliance, and GLAAD to further our knowledge and support of issues facing black, brown, and LGTBQIA+ communities.


•In early 2021 the Company launched its first phase of a multi phased DEI strategy focused on understanding the Company's baseline within five areas of the organization. Feedback from the Company’s 2021 engagement survey around questions specific to DEI issues helped identify the focus areas.
 •Pay equity was a key focus area in 2021, and the company underwent an extensive pay equity analysis with an external vendor, committing to closing all uncovered gaps starting with highest priority by end of 2021 and remaining within next 2 annual cycles.
 •The Company increased visibility and communication of DEI through regular leadership reviews during quarterly meetings, companywide newsletter, focus month observance platform and courageous conversations listening and learning bi-monthly series sponsored by the Executive Leadership team.
 •The Company developed a multi-pronged DEI learning platform integrated within all areas of training in 2021 resulting in several issue specific trainings including bystander and de-escalation training for its local brands and tap room coworkers, LGBTQIA+ policies and representation trainings for its People and Culture and Marketing Departments. In addition, the Company partnered with an external consulting group to enhance the Company's current companywide curriculum around bias, harassment, and leadership trainings. The Company also launched a series of workshops with the executive and extended leadership teams focused on trust, inclusion, and psychological safety.
 •The talent acquisitions team focused it recruiting efforts to a broader and more diverse set of applicants, yielding a 3% uptick in diverse hiring in 2021.
 •In the third quarter of 2021 the Company participated in the HRC Corporate Equality Index, furthering its commitment to utilize external benchmarks to shape the Company's thinking and build credibility with coworkers, consumers, and partners.

As of December 25, 2021, 2 of the 9 members of the Board of Directors were female and 1 of 9 self-identified as part of an underrepresented minority group; 3 of 11 Executive Officers were female and 1 of 11 self-identified as part of an underrepresented minority group. Across the Company’s broader professional population, approximately 34.6% are female and 17.1% self-identified as part of an underrepresented minority group. In 2021, approximately 37.7% of new hires were female and 26.56% self-identified as part of an underrepresented minority group.
 
Corporate Social Responsibility
 
The Company created a stand-alone Social Impact Team in 2020 to approach CSR initiatives with a strategic view across Company organizations, brands, and operating locations.
 
A core philanthropic initiative is Samuel Adams Brewing the American Dream®. In partnership with Accion Opportunity Fund, the nation’s largest non-profit micro-lender, as well as other local non-profit partners, the program supports small business owners in the food, beverage, and brewing industries through access to business capital, coaching, and new market opportunities. The goal is to help strengthen small businesses, create local jobs and build vibrant communities. Since the inception of the Samuel Adams Brewing the American Dream program in 2008, the Company and partners like Accion Opportunity Fund have worked together to loan more than $74 million to nearly 3,500 small business owners who have subsequently repaid these loans at a rate of more than 95%. The loan repayments received are reinvested into the program. Boston Beer employees, together with local business partners and community organizations, have provided coaching and mentoring to more than 13,000 business owners across the country. These efforts have helped to create or maintain more than 9,000 local jobs.

Dogfish Head’s Beer & Benevolence program creatively collaborates with nonprofit organizations to foster community, nourish artistic advancement and cultivate environmental stewardship. The efforts, focused in the mid-Atlantic region that the Dogfish Head brand calls home, invests about $500,000 annually into the local community in the form of direct grants, product donations, fundraising and events. In 2021 Beer & Benevolence partnered with nearly 100 organizations to make impact across the coastal Delaware region.
 
Boston Beer Volunteers! is an initiative piloted through COVID the past two years. The program leverages a digital platform to present coworkers with opportunities to volunteer in their local communities, participate in virtual volunteering and sign up for BBC Benevolence Days. Benevolence Days are on-the-clock single day community service projects organized by the Boston Beer Social Impact Team. During a Benevolence Day coworkers have the opportunity to roll up their sleeves and

make an impact. In addition, Benevolence Days allow cross-team connections as coworkers get the opportunity to work alongside people they do not necessarily work with on a daily basis.
 
Across these three programs and countless other initiatives, the BBC Social Impact Team is focused on empowering coworkers, brands and partners to impact the Company's communities through inclusive engagement to deepen connections and make a difference.
