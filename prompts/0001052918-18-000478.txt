 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
General 

We were incorporated in the State of Idaho in August 1968 under the name Silver Crystal Mines, Inc., to engage in the business of exploring for precious metal deposits and advancing them toward production. We ceased exploration activities during the 1990s and became virtually inactive. In December 2003, a group of investors purchased 80-percent of the issued and outstanding common stock from the then-controlling management team. In January 2004, we affected a one-for-four reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and increased the number of our authorized shares of common stock to 100,000,000 with a par value of $0.001. 

In February 2004, our name was changed to Timberline Resources Corporation. Since the reorganization, we have been in an exploration stage evaluating, acquiring, and exploring mineral prospects with potential for economic deposits of precious and base metals. We define a prospect as a mining property, the value of which has not been determined by exploration. In August 2008, we reincorporated into the State of Delaware pursuant to a merger agreement approved by our shareholders.

In July 2007, we closed our purchase of the Butte Highlands Gold Project. In October 2008, we announced that we had agreed to form a 50/50 joint venture at the Butte Highlands project. In July 2009, we finalized the joint venture agreement with Highland Mining, LLC (Highland) to create Butte Highlands JV, LLC (BHJV). Under terms of the joint venture agreement, development began in the summer of 2009, with Highland funding all mine development costs through development. Both Timberlines and Highlands 50-percent share of costs were to be paid out of net proceeds from future mine production. On January 29, 2016, we executed a Member Interest Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with New Jersey Mining Company pursuant to which we sold all of our 50% interest in BHJV.

In June 2010, we closed our acquisition of Staccato Gold Resources Ltd. (Staccato Gold), a Canadian-based resource company that was in the business of acquiring, exploring, and developing mineral properties with a focus on gold exploration in the dominant gold producing trends in Nevada. As a result of this acquisition, we obtained Staccatos flagship gold exploration project (Lookout Mountain), and several other projects at various stages of exploration in the Battle Mountain/Eureka gold trend in north-central Nevada, along with Staccato Golds wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, BH Minerals USA, Inc. (BH Minerals).

In August 2014, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 shares, par value $0.001, to 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001.

In August 2014, our stockholders approved a one-for-twelve reverse stock split of the companys common stock. The one-for-twelve reverse stock split was effective October 31, 2014. As a result of the reverse stock split, the number of issued and outstanding shares was adjusted and the number of shares underlying outstanding stock options and warrants and the related exercise prices were adjusted. Following the effective date of the reverse stock split, the par value of the common stock remained at $0.001 per share. Unless otherwise indicated, all references herein to shares outstanding and share issuances have been adjusted to give effect to the aforementioned stock split. 

In August 2014, we closed our acquisition of Wolfpack Gold (Nevada) Corp. (Wolfpack US), a U.S. company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wolfpack Gold Corp. a Canadian-based resource company (Wolfpack Gold), that was in the business of acquiring, exploring, and developing mineral properties with a focus on gold exploration in the dominant gold producing trends in Nevada. As a result of this acquisition, we obtained cash and several projects at various stages of exploration in the gold trends in Nevada.

On March 12, 2015 (the Effective Date), we entered into a property option agreement (Agreement) with Gunpoint Exploration Ltd. (Gunpoint), which closed on March 31, 2015. Gunpoint granted us an exclusive and irrevocable option (Option) to purchase a 100% interest in Gunpoints Talapoosa project (the Project) in western Nevada. Pursuant to the Agreement, we had the right to exercise the Option at any time through September 12, 2017, unless sooner terminated (Option Period). In October 2016, the Agreement was amended in order to extend the option exercise period until March 31, 2019. Amended terms include interim payments due in March 2017 and March 2018, a commitment to undertake cumulative project expenditures of a minimum of $7.5 million by December 31, 2018.

On September 13, 2015, we signed a non-binding Letter Agreement ("Letter Agreement") with Waterton Precious Metals Fund II Cayman, LP (together with its subsidiaries and affiliated and associated entities, "Waterton"). Waterton offered to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock for cash consideration of $0.58 per share (the "Transaction"). In connection with the Transaction, Waterton subscribed for 1,331,861 common shares of Timberline on a private placement basis at a price of $0.375 per share for total proceeds of $499,448. The private placement was not contingent on completion of the Transaction, and Waterton reserved the right to maintain its pro rata ownership position in us in the event the Transaction was not completed.

On December 3, 2015, we announced that the exclusivity period granted to Waterton under the Letter Agreement had expired, and while Waterton was continuing certain due diligence activities, the Transaction as previously proposed had been withdrawn by Waterton. We continued to review strategic alternatives, and discussions between us and various parties, including Waterton, continued, but no strategic alternatives are the subject of material discussions as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

On May 26, 2016, the Company entered into three loan and securities purchase agreements (collectively, the Loan Agreements) whereby the Company agreed to issue certain unsecured promissory notes (collectively, the Notes) in the aggregate amount of $57,200. One Note was issued in favor of Steven Osterberg (the Osterberg Note), the Companys President & Chief Executive Officer, one Note in favor of Robert Martinez (the Martinez Note), a member of the Companys Board of Directors, and one Note in favor of Randal Hardy (the Hardy Note), an advisor to the Company. The Osterberg Note had an original principal amount of $22,000, the Martinez Note had an original principal amount of $13,200 and the Hardy Note had an original principal amount of $22,000. Each Note did not bear interest but was subject to an original issue discount equal to 9.1% of the principal amount of such Note. Each Note was unsecured, and matured on May 31, 2016. The issuance of the Notes was approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Companys Board of Directors on May 20, 2016.

On March 31, 2017, we paid the Talapoosa option payment of $1 million, and on April 13, 2017, we issued 1 million common shares, both of which were interim payments due to a subsidiary of Gunpoint pursuant to our option agreement to acquire a 100% interest in the Talapoosa project in western Nevada. 

On March 31, 2018, we did not make the required payment of $2 million nor issue the one million common shares of the Company by March 31, 2018, as required by the Amended Agreement, and, therefore, the Amended Agreement was terminated per its terms on March 31, 2018. We have no future plans or obligations related to the Talapoosa project. The termination of the Agreement and abandonment of the property, resulted in a $3.2 million write off of a Loss on abandonment of mineral rights.

In May 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ownership interests in two joint venture agreements in Nevada from Americas Gold Exploration, Inc (AGEI). The acquisition includes a 73.7% interest in the Paiute property joint venture with LAC Minerals (USA) LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, and the opportunity to earn up to 65% ownership in the Elder Creek joint venture with McEwen Mining, Inc. The acquisition of the two joint venture ownership interests, at Elder Creek with McEwen Mining and at Paiute with Barrick Gold, from AGEI closed on August 14, 2018 for consideration of ten million shares of our common stock and five million warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. An additional five million warrants with the same terms are expected to be issued to AGEI, subject to certain achievements. Upon closing, we became the operator at both of these joint venture projects.

Overview of Our Mineral Exploration Business

We are a mineral exploration business and, if and when we establish mineral reserves, a development company. Mineral exploration is essentially a research activity that does not produce a product. Successful exploration often results in increased project value that can be realized through the optioning or selling of the claimed site to larger companies. We acquire properties which we believe have potential to host economic concentrations of minerals, particularly gold and silver. These acquisitions have and may take the form of unpatented mining claims on federal land, or leasing claims or private property owned by others. An unpatented mining claim is an interest that can be acquired to the mineral rights on open lands of the federally owned public domain. Claims are staked in accordance with the Mining Law of 1872, recorded with the federal government pursuant to laws and regulations established by the Bureau of Land Management (the Federal agency that administers Americas public lands), and grant the holder of the claim a possessory interest in the mineral rights, subject to the paramount title of the United States. 

We will perform basic geological work to identify specific drill targets on the properties, and then collect subsurface samples by drilling to confirm the presence of mineralization (the presence of economic minerals in a specific area or geological formation). We may enter into joint venture agreements with other companies to fund further exploration and/or development work. It is our plan to focus on assembling a high quality group of gold and silver exploration prospects using the experience and contacts of the management group. By such prospects, we mean properties that may have been previously identified by third parties, including prior owners such as exploration companies, as mineral prospects with potential for economic mineralization. Often these properties have been sampled, mapped and sometimes drilled, usually with indefinite results. Accordingly, such acquired projects will either have some prior exploration history or will have strong similarity to a recognized geologic ore deposit model. We will place geographic emphasis on the western United States, and Nevada in particular. 

The focus of our activity has been to acquire properties that we believe to be undervalued; including those that we believe to hold previously unrecognized mineral potential. Properties have been acquired through the location of unpatented mining claims (which allow the claimholder the right to mine the minerals without holding title to the property), or by negotiating lease/option agreements. Our President and CEO, Steven Osterberg, and our CFO, Ted Sharp, as well as our Directors, have experience in evaluating, staking and filing unpatented mining claims, and in negotiating and preparing mineral lease agreements in connection with those mining claims. 

The geologic potential and ore deposit models have been defined and specific drill targets identified on the majority of our properties. Our property evaluation process involves using basic geologic fieldwork to perform an initial evaluation of a property. If the evaluation is positive, we seek to acquire it, either by staking unpatented mining claims on open public domain, or by leasing the property from the owner of private property or the owner of unpatented claims. Once acquired, we then typically make a more detailed evaluation of the property. This detailed evaluation involves expenditures for exploration work which may include rock and soil sampling, geologic mapping, geophysics, trenching, drilling, or other means to determine if economic mineralization is present on the property. 

Portions of our mineral properties at September 30, 2018 are owned by third parties and leased to us, or carry a financial commitment from us, as outlined in the following table.

Seven Troughs | Slash, Inc. | 302 | 4,030 | 2% NSR; 50-year lease term commencing December 31, 1975; no annual lease payments; 
Elder Creek (McEwen Joint Venture Agreement) | McEwen Mining | 583 | 9,600 acres | Joint Venture Earn-in Agreement; 51% ownership for $2.6 million spending over 4 years; ownership increased to 65% for an additional $2.5 million in work commitment 
Paiute (ICBM JV with LAC Minerals) | LAC Minerals (subsidiary of Barrick Gold) | 65 | 1,343 acres | ICBM Joint Venture Earn-in; 60% ownership for $300,000 work commitment with standard dilution thereafter; historic expenditures bring current Timberline ownership to 75.4%.


All of the leases are contracts with varied terms which provide for us to earn an interest in the property. For additional information see Item 2 - Description of Property below.

Our strategy with properties deemed to be of higher risk or those that would require very large exploration expenditures is to present them to larger companies for strategic partnerships. Our strategy is intended to maximize the abilities and skills of the management group, conserve capital, and provide superior leverage for investors. If we present a property to a major company and they are not interested, we will continue to seek an interested partner. 

For our prospects where drilling costs are reasonable and the likelihood of success seems favorable, we will undertake our own drilling. The target depths, the tenor of mineralization on the surface, and the general geology of the area are all factors that determine the risk as calculated by us in conducting a drilling operation. Mineral exploration is a research and development activity and is, by definition, a high risk business that relies on numerous untested assumptions and variables. Accordingly, we make our decisions on a project-by-project basis. We do not have any steadfast formula that we apply in determining the reasonableness of drilling costs in comparison to the likelihood of success, i.e., in determining whether the probability of success seems favorable.

Our Competition 

The mineral exploration industry is intensely competitive in all phases. In our mineral exploration activities, we will compete with many companies possessing greater financial resources and technical facilities than we do for the acquisition of mineral concessions, claims, leases, and other mineral interests as well as for the recruitment and retention of qualified employees, including mining engineers, geologists, and other skilled mining professionals. We use consultants and compete with other mining companies for the man hours of consulting time required to complete our studies. We also compete with other mining companies for exploration and development equipment and services. We must overcome significant barriers to enter into the business of mineral exploration as a result of our limited operating history. 

We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete in any of our business areas effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures faced by us will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. 

Our Offices and Other Facilities 

We currently maintain our administrative office at 101 East Lakeside Ave., Coeur dAlene, ID 83814. The telephone number is (866) 513-4859 (toll free) or (208) 664-4859. We also maintain field offices and warehouse space in Eureka, NV 89316.
Our Employees 

We are an exploration company and currently have 2 full-time employees. Management engages independent consultants under contract arrangements as necessary to execute on company strategies in the current financially challenging environment, and expects to hire staff and additional management as necessary for implementation of our business plan. 
Regulation 

The exploration and mining industries operate in a legal environment that requires permits to conduct virtually all operations. These permits are required by local, state, and federal government agencies. Federal agencies that may be involved include: The U.S. Forest Service (USFS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), and the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Individual states also have various environmental regulatory bodies, such as Departments of Ecology. Local authorities, usually counties, also have control over mining activity. The various permits address such issues as prospecting, development, production, labor standards, taxes, occupational health and safety, toxic substances, air quality, water use, water discharge, water quality, noise, dust, wildlife impacts, as well as other environmental and socioeconomic issues. 

Prior to receiving the necessary permits to explore or mine, a mine operator must comply with all regulatory requirements imposed by all governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project area. Very often, in order to obtain the requisite permits, the operator must have its land reclamation, restoration, or replacement plans pre-approved. Specifically, the operator must present its plan as to how it intends to restore or replace the affected area. Often all or any of these requirements can cause delays or involve costly studies or alterations of the proposed activity or time frame of operations, in order to mitigate impacts. All of these factors make it more difficult and costly to operate and have a negative and sometimes fatal impact on the viability of the exploration or mining operation. Finally, it is possible that future changes in these laws or regulations could have a significant impact on our business, causing those activities to be economically re-evaluated at that time. For a more detailed discussion of governmental and environmental regulatory requirements applicable to our mineral exploration business see the section titled Description of Properties - Overview of Regulatory, Economic and Environmental Issues below.
 Reclamation 
 We generally are required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts are conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.

The Commodities Market 

The prices of gold and silver have fluctuated during the last several years, with the prices of gold and silver falling to their lowest levels in the past several years in 2015 and early 2016, before rebounding. In 2017, gold traded between approximately $1,151 and $1,346 per ounce. In 2018, gold has traded between approximately $1,175 and $1,355 per ounce. The price of gold was $1,260 per ounce on December 20, 2018. All of these gold prices are based on the London PM Fix Price per troy ounce of gold in U.S. dollars.

In 2017, silver traded between approximately $15.22 and $18.56 per ounce. In 2018, silver has traded between approximately $13.97 and $17.52 per ounce. The price of silver was $14.77 per ounce on December 20, 2018. All of these silver prices are based on the London Fix Price per troy ounce of silver in U.S. dollars. 

Seasonality

Seasonality in Nevada is not a material factor to our operations. Certain surface exploration work may need to be conducted when there is no snow on the ground, but it is not a material issue.
