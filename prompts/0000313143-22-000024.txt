ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
Haemonetics is a global healthcare company dedicated to providing a suite of innovative medical products and solutions for customers, to help them improve patient care and reduce the cost of healthcare. Our technology addresses important medical markets: blood and plasma component collection, the surgical suite and hospital transfusion services. When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” mean Haemonetics.
Blood is essential to a modern healthcare system. Blood and its components (plasma, red cells and platelets) have many vital and frequently life-saving clinical applications. Plasma is used for patients with major blood loss and is manufactured into biopharmaceuticals to treat a variety of illnesses, including immune diseases and coagulation disorders. Red cells treat trauma patients or patients undergoing surgery with high blood loss, such as open heart surgery or organ transplant. Platelets have many uses in patient care, including supporting cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. 
We view our operations and manage our business in three principal reporting segments: Plasma, Blood Center and Hospital. For that purpose, “Plasma” includes plasma collection devices and disposables, plasma donor management software, and anticoagulant and saline sold to plasma customers. “Blood Center” includes blood collection and processing devices and disposables for red cells, platelets and whole blood. “Hospital”, which is comprised of Hemostasis Management, Vascular Closure, Transfusion Management and Cell Salvage products, includes devices and methodologies for measuring coagulation characteristics of blood, surgical blood salvage systems, specialized blood cell processing systems and disposables, blood transfusion management software and vascular closure devices. Financial information concerning these segments is provided in Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We believe that Plasma and Hospital have growth potential, while Blood Center competes in challenging markets that require us to manage the business differently, including reducing costs, shrinking the scope of the current product line, and evaluating opportunities to exit unfavorable customer contracts.
Market and Products
Product Lines
The following describes our principal products in each of our segments.
•Plasma
Our Plasma business offers automated plasma collection and donor management software systems that improve the yield, efficiency, quality, safety and overall donor experience at plasma collection centers. We continue to invest in technology that lowers the overall cost to collect plasma while maintaining high standards of quality and safety.
Plasma Collection Market for Fractionation — Human plasma is collected for two purposes. First, it is used for transfusions in patients, such as trauma victims who need to compensate for extreme blood loss, and second, it is processed into pharmaceuticals that aid in the treatment of immune diseases and coagulation disorders. 
Plasma for transfusion is almost exclusively collected by blood centers as part of their broader mission to supply blood components. Plasma that is fractionated and manufactured into pharmaceuticals - frequently referred to as “source plasma” - is mainly collected by vertically integrated biopharmaceutical companies who operate their own collection centers and recruit donors specifically for source plasma donation. The markets for transfusion plasma and source plasma have different participants, product requirements and growth profiles. We serve the market for plasma that is processed into pharmaceuticals through our Plasma business, and we serve the market for transfusion plasma through our Blood Center business.
One of the distinguishing features of the source plasma market is the method of collection. There are three primary ways to collect plasma. The first is to collect it from whole blood donations. When whole blood is processed, plasma can be separated at the same time as red cells and platelets and stored for future use. The second is as part of an apheresis procedure that also collects another blood component. These two methods are mainly used by blood centers to collect plasma for transfusions. The third method is a dedicated apheresis procedure that only collects plasma and 
returns the other blood components to the donor. This third method is almost exclusively used for source plasma collection. 
Our Plasma business unit focuses on the collection of source plasma by pharmaceutical manufacturers using apheresis devices that only collect plasma and software solutions that support the efficient operation of dedicated source plasma collection centers. Our Blood Center business supports the collection of plasma for blood collectors, such as the American Red Cross, using both whole blood collections sets and multi-component apheresis collection devices.
Over the last 20 years, the collection of source plasma has increasingly been performed by vertically integrated biopharmaceutical companies such as CSL Limited (together with its affiliates, “CSL”), Grifols S.A. (together with its affiliates, “Grifols”), Octapharma AG and Takeda's BioLife Plasma subsidiary. With their global operations and management expertise, these companies are focused on efficient plasma supply chain management and leveraging information technology to manage operations from the point of plasma donation through fractionation to the production of the final product.
Demand for source plasma has continued to grow because of an expanding end user market for plasma-derived biopharmaceuticals. In particular, therapies that require a significant quantity of plasma to create have fueled an increase in the number of donations and dedicated source plasma collection centers. A significant portion of this growth has occurred in the United States with U.S. produced plasma now meeting an increasing percentage of plasma volume demand worldwide. The U.S. has regulations that are significantly more favorable relative to other markets for plasma collectors. The frequency with which a donor may donate, the volume of plasma that may be donated each time and the ability to remunerate donors are all optimal in the U.S., leading to approximately 70% of worldwide source plasma collections occurring in the U.S. Plasma collectors have long sought changes to plasma collection regulations outside of the U.S. to allow for greater frequency, volume per donation, and remuneration but achievements have been limited and no significant short-term changes are foreseen in the prevalence of U.S. collections.
Plasma Products — Built around our automated plasma collection devices, related disposables, and software, our portfolio of products and services is designed to support multiple facets of plasma collector operations. We have a long-standing commitment to understanding our customers' collection and manufacturing processes. As a result, we aim to design equipment that is durable, dependable, and easy to use and to provide comprehensive training and support to our plasma collection customers. 
Today, nearly all source plasma collections worldwide are performed using automated collection technology at dedicated facilities. We offer multiple products to support these dedicated source plasma operations, including our NexSys PCS® and PCS2® plasmapheresis equipment, related disposables and intravenous solutions. We also offer a portfolio of integrated information technology platforms for plasma customers to manage their donors, operations and supply chain. Our software products, including our latest NexLynk DMS® donor management system and Donor360®  app, automate the donor interview and qualification process, streamline the workflow process in the plasma center, provide the controls necessary to evaluate donor suitability, determine the ability to release units collected and manage unit distribution. With our software solutions, plasma collectors can manage processes across the plasma supply chain, ensure quality and compliance business process support, react quickly to business changes and implement opportunities to reduce costs.
With our PCS brand, we have provided an automated platform dedicated to the collection of plasma for over 20 years. In fiscal 2018, we began transitioning customers from our PCS2 equipment to NexSys PCS.
NexSys PCS is designed to enable higher plasma yield collections, improve productivity in our customers’ centers, enhance the overall donor experience and provide safe and reliable collections that will become life-changing medicines for patients. NexSys PCS includes bi-directional connectivity to the NexLynk DMS donor management system to improve operational efficiency within plasma centers, through automated programming of donation procedures and automated data capture of procedure data. 
The NexSys PCS capabilities enable collections with higher plasma yields. Our YESTM technology is a yield-enhancing solution that enables increases in plasma yield per collection by an additional 18-26 mL per donation, on average. In fiscal 2021, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for our NexSys PCS with Persona® technology. NexSys PCS with Persona technology uses a percent plasma nomogram that customizes plasma collection based on an individual donor's body composition, including an additional 9-12% plasma yield. The new, proprietary Persona technology strengthens the NexSys PCS value proposition and reinforces our commitment to supporting the plasma 
industry. We expect to pursue further regulatory clearances for additional enhancements to the overall product offering.
We have entered into long-term commercial contracts and are continuing the rollout and support of NexSys PCS devices and NexLynk DMS donor management software for these Plasma customers.
Our Plasma business unit represented 35.4%, 38.2% and 46.4% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
•Blood Center
Our Blood Center business offers a range of solutions that improve donor collection centers' ability to collect and filter blood and separate blood components. We continue to look for solutions to help our customers improve donor safety and control costs through the existing product portfolio. Our products and technologies help donor collection centers optimize blood collection capabilities and donor processing management.
Blood Center Market — There are millions of blood donations throughout the world every year that produce blood products for transfusion to surgical, trauma or chronically ill patients. Patients typically receive only the blood components necessary to treat a particular clinical condition. Platelet therapy is frequently used to alleviate the effects of chemotherapy and to help patients with bleeding disorders. Red cells are often transfused to patients to replace blood lost during surgery and transfused to patients with blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia or aplastic anemia. Plasma, in addition to its role in creating life-saving pharmaceuticals, is frequently transfused to replace blood volume in trauma victims and surgical patients.
When collecting blood components there are two primary collection methods, manual whole blood donations and automated component blood collections. While most donations are manual whole blood, the benefit of automated component blood collections is the ability to collect more than one unit of the targeted blood component. Manual whole blood donations are collected from the donor and then transported to a laboratory where the blood is separated into its components. Automated component blood collections separate the blood component real-time while a person is donating blood. In this method, only the specific target blood component is collected and the remaining components are returned to the blood donor.
While overall we expect total demand for blood to remain stable to slightly declining, demand in individual markets can vary greatly. The development in mature markets of more minimally invasive procedures with lower associated blood loss, as well as hospitals' improved blood management techniques and protocols have more than offset the increasing demand for blood from aging populations. Emerging markets are seeing demand growth with expanded healthcare coverage and greater access to more advanced medical treatments.
Blood Center Products — We offer automated blood component and manual whole blood collection systems to blood collection centers to collect blood products efficiently and cost effectively. 
•We market the MCS® brand apheresis equipment which is designed to collect specific blood components from the donor. Utilizing the MCS automated platelet collection protocols, blood centers collect one or more therapeutic “doses” of platelets during a single donation.
•Our portfolio of disposable whole blood collection and component storage sets offer flexibility in collecting a unit of whole blood and the subsequent production and storage of blood components, including options for in-line or dockable filters for leukoreduction.
Our Blood Center business unit represented 30.1%, 35.3% and 32.1% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
•Hospital
Hospitals are called upon to provide the highest standard of patient care while at the same time reduce operating costs. Haemonetics' Hospital business has four product lines: Hemostasis Management, Vascular Closure, Transfusion Management and Cell Salvage. Vascular Closure became a product line during fiscal 2021 as a result of the March 2021 acquisition of Cardiva Medical, Inc. (“Cardiva”), a market leader in vascular closure devices. Each product line has a leading market position and a mission of helping hospitals and clinicians provide the highest standard of patient care while at the same time reducing operating and procedural costs and helping decision makers in hospitals optimize blood acquisition, storage and usage in critical settings.
Hemostasis Management
Hemostasis Management Market — Hemostasis refers to a patient's ability to form and maintain blood clots. The clinical management of hemostasis requires that physicians have the most complete information to make decisions on how to best maintain a patient’s coagulation equilibrium between hemorrhage (bleeding) and thrombosis (clotting). Hemostasis is a critical challenge in various medical procedures, including cardiovascular surgery, organ transplantation, trauma, post-partum hemorrhage and percutaneous coronary intervention. By understanding a patient’s hemostasis status, clinicians can better plan for the patient’s care pathway. For example, they may decide whether to start or discontinue the use of certain drugs or determine the need for a transfusion and which specific blood components would be most effective in minimizing blood loss and reducing clotting risk. Such planning supports better care, which can lead to lower hospital costs through a reduction in unnecessary blood product transfusions, reduced adverse transfusion reactions and shorter intensive care unit and hospital stays.
Hemostasis Management Products — Our portfolio of hemostasis diagnostic systems enables clinicians to assess holistically the coagulation status of a patient at the point-of-care or laboratory setting. We have four viscoelastic testing systems that we market to hospitals and laboratories as an alternative to routine blood tests: the TEG® 5000 hemostasis analyzer system, the TEG 6s hemostasis analyzer system, the ClotPro® hemostasis analyzer system, and the HAS-100 hemostasis analyzer system. While the TEG and HAS platforms utilize thromboelastography and the ClotPro system utilizes thromboelastometry, all of the platforms provide a method of testing the efficiency of blood coagulation using whole blood samples.
Each hemostasis diagnostic system consists of an analyzer that is used with single-use reagents and disposables. In addition, TEG Manager® software connects multiple TEG 5000 and TEG 6S analyzers throughout the hospital, providing clinicians with remote access to both active and historical test results that inform treatment decisions.
The TEG 5000 system is approved for a broad set of indications in all of our markets. The TEG 6s system is approved for the same set of indications as the TEG 5000 in Europe, Australia and Japan. We continue to pursue a broader set of indications for TEG 6s in the U.S. We received FDA clearance for the use of TEG 6s in adult trauma settings. This clearance builds on the current indication for the TEG 6s system in cardiovascular surgery and cardiology procedures, making it the first cartridge-based system available in the U.S. to evaluate the hemostasis condition in adult trauma patients. The ClotPro system received CE mark clearance and is currently available in select European and Asia Pacific markets. The HAS-100 device is currently commercialized in China.
Vascular Closure
Vascular Closure Market — Catheter-based, minimally invasive alternatives to open surgery have transformed cardiovascular medicine. The majority of these procedures gain access to the vascular system through the femoral artery or vein. These access sites in the vessel require closure post procedure. Even with the major advances in technology over the last 40 years, the most common complications in coronary and peripheral procedures are still related to the access site. Manual compression, the traditional standard of care, involves the application of pressure in order to facilitate the formation of a blood clot at the access site. Vascular closure devices improve upon manual compression by rapidly closing the access site and facilitating more efficient workflow.
Vascular Closure Products — The VASCADE® technology platform was developed to address the limitations of manual compression and existing vascular closure devices. Our VASCADE family of products consists of two devices, VASCADE and VASCADE MVP®, which share a common, innovative technology that features a simple, catheter-based delivery system and leverages the natural clot-inducing properties of collagen. This novel design significantly reduces access site complications, increases patient satisfaction and improves hospital workflow metrics that, in turn, drive economic benefits and cost savings. Our Vascular Closure devices address the growing number of catheter-based coronary, peripheral and electrophysiology procedures that require vascular access site closure each year.
Designed around an easy to use, catheter-based delivery system and the natural clot-inducing properties of collagen, our VASCADE product is the only marketed vascular closure device clinically proven to both increase workflow efficiency and reduce access site complications relative to manual compression for coronary and peripheral procedures. Similarly, our VASCADE MVP device is the only marketed vascular closure device clinically proven and labeled to improve workflow relative to manual compression for electrophysiology procedures. Importantly, these improvements drive meaningful cost savings for hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and other treatment facilities. 
During fiscal 2022, the VASCADE MVP Venous Vascular Closure System became the first and only vascular closure device to receive FDA indication for same-day discharge following atrial fibrillation ablation. 
Transfusion Management
Transfusion Management Market — Hospital transfusion services professionals and clinicians are facing cost restraints in addition to the pressure to enhance patient safety, compliance and operational efficiency. Managing the safety and traceability of the blood supply chain and comprehensive management of patients, orders, specimens, blood products, derivatives and accessories across the hospital network is challenging. In addition, providing clinicians with the vital access to blood when needed most while maintaining traceability is a key priority. Frequently when blood products leave the blood bank, the transfusion management staff loses control and visibility of the blood components. They often do not know if the blood was handled, stored or transfused properly, which may lead to negative effects on patient safety, product quality, inventory availability and staff efficiency as well as increased waste.
Transfusion Management Products — Our Transfusion Management solutions are designed to help provide safety, traceability and compliance from the hospital blood bank to the patient bedside and enable consistent care across the hospital network. Our SafeTrace Tx® transfusion management software is considered the system of record for all hospital blood bank and transfusion service information. BloodTrack® blood management software is a modular suite of blood management and bedside transfusion solutions that combines software with hardware components and acts as an extension of the hospital’s blood bank information system. The software is designed to work with blood storage devices, including the BloodTrack HaemoBank®.
Cell Salvage
Cell Salvage Market — The Cell Salvage market is mainly comprised of devices designed to transfuse back a patient’s own blood during or after surgery. Loss of blood is common in many surgical procedures, including open heart, trauma, transplant, vascular and orthopedic procedures, and the need for transfusion of oxygen-carrying red cells to make up for lost blood volume is routine. Patients commonly receive donor (or allogeneic) blood which carries various risks for transfusion reactions including chills, fevers or other side effects that can prolong a patient’s recovery.
An alternative to allogeneic blood is surgical cell salvage, also known as autotransfusion, which reduces or eliminates a patient’s need for blood donated from others and ensures that the patient receives the freshest and safest blood possible - his or her own. Surgical cell salvage involves the collection of a patient’s own blood during or after surgery for reinfusion of red cells to that patient. Blood is suctioned from the surgical site or collected from a wound or chest drain, processed and washed through a centrifuge-based system that yields concentrated red cells available for transfusion back to the patient. This process occurs in a sterile, closed-circuit, single-use consumable set that is fitted into an electromechanical device. We market our surgical blood salvage products to surgical specialists, primarily cardiovascular, orthopedic and trauma surgeons, and to anesthesiologists and surgical suite service providers.
Cell Salvage Products — Our Cell Saver® Elite®+ autologous blood recovery system is a surgical blood salvage system targeted to medium to high blood loss procedures, such as cardiovascular, orthopedic, trauma, transplant, vascular, obstetrical and gynecological surgeries. The Cell Saver Elite + is designed to minimize allogeneic blood use and reliably recover and transfuse a patient’s own high-quality blood.
Our Hospital business unit represented 32.5%, 24.2% and 19.6% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Marketing/Sales/Distribution
We market and sell our products to biopharmaceutical companies, blood collection groups and independent blood centers, hospitals and hospital service providers, group purchasing organizations and national health organizations through our own direct sales force (including full-time sales representatives and clinical specialists) as well as independent distributors. Sales representatives target the primary decision-makers within each of those organizations.
Research and Development
Our research and development centers in the U.S. ensure that protocol variations are incorporated to closely match local customer requirements. In addition, Haemonetics maintains software development operations in Canada. 
Customer collaborations are also an important part of our technical strength and competitive advantage. These collaborations with customers and transfusion experts provide us with ideas for new products and applications, enhanced protocols and potential test sites as well as objective evaluations and expert opinions regarding technical and performance issues.
The development of blood component separation products, hemostasis analyzers and software has required us to maintain technical expertise in various engineering disciplines, including mechanical, electrical, software, biomedical engineering and chemistry. Innovations resulting from these various engineering efforts enable us to develop systems that are faster, smaller and more user-friendly, or that incorporate additional features important to our customer base.
In fiscal 2022, research and development resources were allocated to support innovation across our product portfolio. In October 2020, we announced FDA clearance for our NexSys PCS® with Persona® technology. In April 2020, we also announced the commercial availability of the next generation of SafeTrace Tx Transfusion Management Software in the United Kingdom. This software version features significant improvements to the user experience and workflow efficiency. Additionally, we have continued to make investments related to our next generation plasma collection and software systems, the European Medical Device Regulation and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation, our Hemostasis Management product line, and our recent product acquisitions in Hospital.
Manufacturing
We endeavor to supply products that are both high quality and cost competitive for our customers by leveraging continuous improvement methodologies, focusing on our core competencies and partnering with strategic suppliers that complement our capabilities. In general, we design our equipment and consumables and use contract manufacturers to build the devices, while the majority of consumables are manufactured by us.
Our production activities occur in controlled settings or “clean room” environments and have built-in quality checks throughout the manufacturing processes. Our manufacturing teams are focused on continuously improving our productivity, product cost and product quality through change control procedures, validations and strong supplier management programs. We regularly review our logistics capabilities, inventory and safety stock levels and maintain business continuity plans to address supply disruptions that may occur. 
Our primary consumable manufacturing operations are located in North America and Malaysia. Contract manufacturers also supply component sets and liquid solutions according to our specifications and manufacture in Japan, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines. Our capital equipment is principally manufactured in Malaysia, Australia and the U.S.
Plastics and other petroleum-based products are the principal components of our disposable products and can be affected by oil and gas prices. Contracts with our suppliers help to mitigate some of the short term effects of price volatility in this market. However, increases in the price of petroleum derivatives could result in corresponding increases in our costs to procure plastic raw materials.
Intellectual Property
We consider our intellectual property rights to be important to our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as provisions in our agreements with third parties, to protect our intellectual property rights.
We hold numerous patents in the United States and have applied for numerous additional U.S. patents relating to our products and related technologies. We also own or have applied for corresponding patents in selected foreign countries. These patents cover certain elements of our products and processes, including protocols employed in our equipment and aspects of certain of our disposables. Our patents may cover current products, products in markets we plan to enter, or products in markets we plan to license to others. Certain patents may also be defensive in that they are directed to technologies not currently embodied in our current products. We also may license patent rights from third parties that cover technologies that we use or plan to use in our business.
We own various trademarks that have been registered in the United States and certain other countries.
Our policy is to obtain patent and trademark rights in the U.S. and foreign countries where such rights are available and we believe it is commercially advantageous to do so. However, the standards for international protection of intellectual property vary widely. We cannot assure that pending patent and trademark applications will result in issued patents and registered 
trademarks, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that our patents will not be determined invalid.
To maintain our competitive position, we also rely on the technical expertise and know-how of our personnel. We believe that unpatented know-how and trade secrets relied upon in connection with our business and products are generally as important as patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage.
Competition
To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and acquire new cost-effective products, information technology platforms and business services. We believe that our ability to maintain a competitive advantage will continue to depend on a combination of factors. Some factors are largely within our control such as: (i) maintenance of a positive reputation among our customers, (ii) development of new products that meet our customer's needs, (iii) obtaining regulatory approvals for our products in key markets, (iv) obtaining patents that protect our innovations, (v) development and protection of proprietary know-how in important technological areas, (vi) product quality, safety and cost effectiveness and (vii) continual and rigorous documentation of clinical performance. Other factors are outside of our control. We could see changes in regulatory standards or clinical practice that favor a competitor's technology or reduce revenues in key areas of our business.
Our technical staff is highly skilled, but certain competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger technical staff at their disposal. There can be no assurance that competitors will not direct substantial efforts and resources toward the development and marketing of products competitive with those of Haemonetics.
In addition, we face competition from several large, global companies with product offerings similar to ours. Terumo Blood and Cell Technologies (“Terumo BCT”) and Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA, in particular, have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do and are strong competitors in a number of our businesses. The following provides an overview of the key competitors in each of our three global product enterprises.
•Plasma
In the automated plasma collection market, we principally compete with Fresenius' Fenwal Aurora and Aurora Xi product lines and Terumo BCT's Rika device on the basis of speed, plasma yield per donation, quality, reliability, ease of use, services and technical features of the collection systems and on the long-term cost-effectiveness of equipment and disposables. In China, the market is populated by local producers of a product that is intended to be similar to ours. Recently, those competitors have expanded to markets beyond China, including European and South American countries. In the field of plasma related software, MAK Systems is the primary competitor along with applications developed internally by our customers.
•Blood Center
Most donations worldwide are traditional manual whole blood collections and approximately 30% of the Blood Center portfolio competes in this space. We face intense competition in our whole blood business on the basis of quality and price. Our main competitors are Fresenius, MacoPharma and Terumo BCT.
Our MCS automated component blood collections, which represents approximately 60% of the Blood Center portfolio, not only compete against the traditional manual whole blood collection market (particularly in red cells) but also compete with products from Terumo BCT and Fresenius. Technology is the key differentiator in automated component blood collections, as measured by the time to collect more than one unit of a specific targeted blood component. While not all donors are eligible to donate more than one unit, it continues to become more prevalent in markets with a significant number of eligible donors. Therefore, both Haemonetics and our competitors continue to experience downward pressure on collection through single platelet collection procedures.
•Hospital
Hemostasis Management
Our hemostasis analyzer systems are used primarily in surgical applications. Competition includes routine coagulation tests, such as prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and platelet count marketed by various manufacturers, such as Instrumentation Laboratory, Diagnostica Stago SAS and Sysmex. The TEG analyzer competes with these routine laboratory tests based on its ability to provide a more complete picture of a patient's hemostasis at a single point in time and to measure the clinically relevant platelet function for an individual patient.
In addition, TEG and ClotPro systems compete more directly with other viscoelastic testing systems, including ROTEM® analyzers, the VerifyNow® System and HemoSonics Quantra™. ROTEM and VerifyNow instruments are marketed by Instrumentation Laboratory, a subsidiary of Werfen. HemoSonics is owned and offered by Diagnostica Stago. There are also additional technologies being explored to assess viscoelasticity and other characteristics that can provide insights into the coagulation status of a patient. In the advanced viscoelastic testing segment, Haemonetics is the global market leader.
Vascular Closure
The vascular closure industry is highly competitive and has been evolving rapidly with the introduction of new products, technologies, regulations and activities of industry participants. Our VASCADE family of products serves as an alternative to existing methods of femoral vascular access site closure in interventional procedures, including manual compression and other femoral access closure devices. Our main competitors in femoral access closure for coronary and peripheral procedures include Terumo BCT, Abbott Laboratories and Cardinal Health. There are not currently any competing vascular access site closure devices that are labeled for electrophysiology procedures that require multiple access sites.
We compete primarily on the basis that our products are optimized for the requirements of coronary, peripheral and electrophysiology procedures, including procedures that require multiple access sites. In addition, our value proposition is supported by robust clinical trial evidence and study data, which demonstrate reduced access site complication rates as well as workflow improvements compared to manual compression that lead to cost savings.
Transfusion Management
SafeTrace Tx and BloodTrack compete in the transfusion management software market within the broader category of hospital information systems. SafeTrace Tx is an FDA regulated blood bank information system (“BBIS”) that integrates and communicates with other healthcare information systems such as the electronic health record and laboratory information system within the hospital. The BloodTrack software, also FDA regulated, is an extension of the BBIS and provides secure, traceable blood units at the point-of-care, including trauma, surgery, outpatient and critical care settings. Growth drivers for these markets include patient safety, operational efficiencies and compliance. 
SafeTrace Tx competition primarily consists of stand-alone BBIS including WellSky and some electronic health record software that includes a built-in transfusion management solution including Cerner. Global competition for BloodTrack varies by country including MSoft in Europe and established blood practices in the U.S. such as using standard refrigerators and manual movement of blood products. BloodTrack integrates with the hospital’s existing lab or blood bank system allowing for greater market acceptance.
Cell Salvage
In the intraoperative autotransfusion market, competition is based on reliability, ease of use, service, support and price. For high-volume platforms, each manufacturer's technology is similar and our Cell Saver technology competes principally with products offered by LivaNova PLC, Medtronic and Fresenius.
Significant Customers
In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 45%, 49% and 54% of our net revenues, respectively. In fiscal 2022, one Plasma customer, CSL, was greater than 10% of total net revenue and in total accounted for approximately 12% of net revenues. In addition to CSL, two customers also accounted for greater than 10% of the Plasma segment's net revenues and one customer accounted for greater than 10% of the Blood Center segment's net revenue, but did not exceed 10% of total net revenues, in fiscal 2022.
Government Regulation
Due to the variety of products that we manufacture, we and our products are subject to a wide range of regulations from numerous government agencies, including the FDA, and similar agencies outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products.
In the United States, medical devices, drugs, and biological products are subject to extensive regulation by FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations. The failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to clear or approve applications, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
Medical Device Regulation
Premarket Requirements - U.S.
Unless an exemption applies, all medical devices introduced to the U.S. market are required by the FDA, as a condition of marketing, to secure clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, grant of a request for de novo classification, or approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes based on risk. Devices deemed to pose a low or moderate risk are placed in Class I or II. Manufacturers of most Class II devices, and a few Class I devices, must submit to the FDA a 510(k) premarket notification requesting clearance for commercial distribution. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device are placed in Class III, requiring submission and approval of a PMA or risk-based classification through the de novo process.
To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a previously 510(k)-cleared device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of PMAs, or a device that has been the subject of a de novo classification. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the notification is submitted, but it can take longer, depending on the extent of the FDA's requests for additional information and the amount of time a sponsor takes to fulfill them. We may need to first obtain an investigational device exemption (for significant risk devices), known as an IDE, in order to conduct extensive clinical testing of the device to obtain the necessary clinical data for submission to the FDA. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require premarket approval.
A device that cannot demonstrate substantial equivalence to a previously marketed predicate is automatically deemed Class III. The de novo process provides a pathway to classify novel medical devices for which general controls alone, or general and special controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the intended use, but for which there is no legally marketed predicate device. Once a request for de novo classification is granted by the FDA, the newly classified device may be used as a predicate by the applicant or a competitor in a future 510(k) notification submission, if the FDA determines that new devices of the same type require 510(k) clearance.
Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk are placed in Class III. A PMA is required for most Class III devices. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) and de novo processes. Prior to the acquisition of Cardiva in March 2021, we had not been required to obtain a PMA for any of our products and did not have any Class III products in our product pipeline. With the acquisition of Cardiva, we have acquired VASCADE and VASCADE MVP, which are both Class III products for which PMAs were previously obtained. The 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive, lengthy and require payment of significant user fees.
Postmarket Requirements - U.S.
After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. Generally, establishments that design and/or manufacture devices are required to register with the FDA. They also must provide the FDA with a list of the devices that they design and/or manufacture at their facilities. Other postmarket requirements include compliance with:
•The Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which sets forth current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements for medical devices. The QSR applies to manufacturers, including contract manufacturers, of finished medical devices, and governs methods, facilities, and controls used in designing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storing, installing and servicing such devices. Among other requirements, manufacturers of medical devices must establish a quality system appropriate for the devices they manufacture. 
•Labeling regulations, including unique device identification;
•Medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and
•Medical device correction and removal (recall) regulations with their associated reporting obligations. 
Additionally, we and the manufacturing facilities of some of our suppliers are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations described above. The FDA can issue Form 483 Notices of Observation, warning letters or untitled letters, seek a court order detaining or seizing certain devices, seek an injunction, suspend regulatory clearance or approvals, ban certain medical devices, order repair, replacement or refund of those devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also initiate action for criminal prosecution of violations.
The FDA also may require post market testing, surveillance, or other measures to monitor the effects of an approved or cleared product. The FDA may place conditions on a PMA-approved device that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to QSRs after approval and clearance, and manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with QSRs. The FDA may withdraw product approvals or recommend or require product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory requirements.
Advertising, marketing and promotional activities for devices are also subject to FDA oversight. The failure to comply with the requirements applicable to these activities can result in FDA enforcement action.
Manufacturers of medical devices are permitted to promote products solely for the uses and indications set forth in the approved or cleared product labeling. Promotion of products for uses not described in the approved or cleared labeling (“off-label” uses) has resulted in enforcement actions against manufacturers, including actions alleging violation of the Federal False Claims Act, federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, and state consumer protection laws. The failure to comply with prohibitions on “off-label” promotion can result in significant monetary penalties, suspension of sales of certain products, product recalls, civil or criminal sanctions, exclusion from participating in federal healthcare programs, or other enforcement actions. In the United States, allegations of such wrongful conduct could also result in a corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. government that imposes significant administrative obligations and costs.
Requirements Outside the U.S.
The regulatory review process varies from country to country and may in some cases require the submission of clinical data. Our international sales are subject to regulatory requirements in the countries in which our products are sold. For example, the EU has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (the "EU MDR") and the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the "EU IVDR"), each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and postmarket surveillance, than the medical device directives they replace. The EU MDR became fully applicable as of May 26, 2021, and the EU IVDR is fully applicable as of May 26, 2022. There is a transition period for devices with a notified body certificate with an expiry date after the date of full application. However, a new EU certificate under the applicable Regulations must be obtained before that expiry date if there is to be no interruption in manufacturing and supply of devices to the market. There are nevertheless a number of provisions that need to be complied with from the date of application, including updating the postmarket surveillance process, appointing an importer for the EU, appointing a person responsible for regulatory compliance, and updating economic operator agreements. Complying with the requirements of these regulations has and will continue to require us to incur significant expenditures. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements. Regulatory requirements in other jurisdictions also continue to become more stringent, increasing regulatory requirements to register and maintain products in these markets.
Drug Regulation 
Development and Approval
Under the FDCA, FDA approval of a new drug application, or NDA, is generally required before any new drug can be marketed in the U.S. NDAs require extensive studies and submission of a large amount of data by the applicant.
A generic version of an approved drug is approved by means of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, by which the sponsor demonstrates that the proposed product is the same as the approved, brand-name drug, which is referred to as the 
“reference listed drug,” or RLD. Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and RLD have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, are intended for the same uses and are bioequivalent. This more limited data set is in lieu of independently demonstrating the proposed product’s safety and effectiveness, which are inferred from the fact that the product is the same as the RLD, which the FDA previously found to be safe and effective.
We currently hold NDAs and ANDAs for liquid solutions (including anticoagulants, intravenous saline and a red blood cell storage solution), which we sell with our blood component and whole blood collection systems.
Post-Approval Regulations
After the FDA permits a drug to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include the FDA's current cGMPs, which include a series of requirements relating to organization and training of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, quality control and quality assurance, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, and laboratory controls and records and reports. The FDA has also established labeling regulations, advertising and promotion requirements and restrictions; regulations regarding conducting recalls of product; and requirements relating to the reporting of adverse events.
Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity, such as warning letters, and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and entering into agreements with the government that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug or biological products.
Requirements Outside the U.S.
We must obtain the requisite marketing authorizations from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to marketing of a product in those countries. The requirements and process governing product licensing vary from country to country. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, warning letters or untitled letters, injunctions, civil, administrative, or criminal penalties, monetary fines or imprisonment, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, suspension of ongoing clinical studies, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us, suspension or the imposition of restrictions on operations, product recalls, the refusal to permit the import or export of our products or the seizure or detention of products.
Conflict Minerals
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes disclosure requirements regarding the use of “Conflict Minerals” mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. The conflict minerals include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold and their derivatives. These requirements could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our products. There may be material additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. 
Fraud and Abuse Laws
We are subject to fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products. In addition, we are subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by U.S. federal and state governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. We have described below some of the key federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that apply to our business.
The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply 
to arrangements between manufacturers of federally reimbursed products on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and others in a position to recommend, refer, or order federally reimbursed products on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend medical devices or pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging consultants as speakers or consultants, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within the exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants. Liability may be established without a person or entity having actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fraudulent or materially incomplete claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In recent years, companies in the healthcare industry have faced enforcement actions under the federal False Claims Act for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product or causing false claims to be submitted because of the company’s marketing the product for unapproved and thus non-reimbursable, uses. False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties of tens of thousands of dollars per false claim or statement. Healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, among other things, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payers and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
In addition, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments program, requires manufacturers of certain products reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to track and report information to the federal government on certain payments or transfers of value that they make to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are also required to collect information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives for reporting. The reported data is made available in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.
Many states have adopted analogous laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, regardless of the payer. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and medical device companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs; file periodic reports with the state, including reports on gifts and payments to individual health care providers; make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities; and/or register their sales representatives. Some states prohibit specified sales and marketing practices, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers and/or offering co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs.
Other countries, including a number of EU Member States, have laws of similar application.
Environmental Matters
Failure to comply with international, federal and local environmental protection laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our business or could require material capital expenditures. We continue to monitor changes in U.S. and international environmental regulations and emerging industry expectations that may present a significant risk to the business, including laws or regulations relating to the manufacture or sale of products using plastics and evolving customer expectations with respect to environmental stewardship.
Human Capital
Our employees are the foundation of our organization, each with their own talents, backgrounds and abilities. As of April 2, 2022, we employed the full-time equivalent of 2,821 persons. Approximately 78% of our employees are located in North America and the remaining 22% are located across 19 other countries.
In our industry, there is substantial competition for key personnel in the regions in which we operate. Recruiting, developing and retaining talented employees is critical to both our strategy and our ability to compete effectively in the markets we serve. We are committed to building a collaborative, performance-driven culture that attracts and retains the best talent. We strive to do this by soliciting employee perspectives, investing in their development, promoting employee health and safety, providing competitive pay and benefits and recognizing that the diversity of our teams and their ideas helps build our culture and strengthens our ability to make our work matter for the customers, patients, donors and healthcare providers who depend on us. These efforts include:
•Employee Engagement. We conduct an annual employee engagement survey, with at least 90% global participation since fiscal 2018. Feedback from these surveys is shared across the organization and informs both Company-sponsored initiatives and shared action plans between managers and direct reports.
•Employee Development. We offer a variety of programs and resources designed to facilitate our employees’ career development, training and networking, including:
◦Manager development sessions focused on leadership skills, such as performance management training, coaching and feedback;
◦Continuous improvement training for employees in functions that can best leverage and utilize process improvement practices;
◦Best-in-class learning management system and dynamic content libraries aimed to meet the individual needs of employees’ current roles as well as future goals and aspirations; and
◦Tuition reimbursement to support degree programs and certifications.
•Competitive Pay and Benefits. We offer market-competitive base pay and benefits to our employees around the world. Most of our employees also have variable components to their compensation that are tied to achievement of corporate and individual performance goals, the fluctuations of our stock price, or a combination of both. We also offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan to eligible employees, consistent with our philosophy that compensation should align the interests of employees and shareholders and promote a long-term shareholder perspective. 
•Health and Safety. As a Company, we are also committed to making our workplaces safe and secure. This includes eliminating unsafe work practices and workplace injuries and illnesses and promoting the health, safety and well-being of all employees, contractors and visitors. Important objectives in achieving our vision include: creating a positive safety culture, maintaining an effective safety management system and reducing risk in the workplace. Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic has focused on business continuity and the safety of our employees. This includes prioritizing employee safety with remote work for employees in our administrative functions, implementing extensive cleaning and sanitation processes for all Haemonetics facilities, and instituting various safety protocols to limit exposure for our manufacturing and customer facing employees, including field service and sales teams, to ensure supplies and support for our customers. We have also instituted protocols to ensure compliance with vaccine mandates applicable to our employees. Beginning in March 2022, we executed plans to return employees to offices in jurisdictions where safe and feasible and introduced a new hybrid work model for administrative functions in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions.
•Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. The diversity of our teams and their ideas helps build our collaborative, performance driven culture. We understand the value that each individual brings to our workplace, and we are committed to providing an inclusive environment where every individual has the opportunity to thrive. Additionally, we encourage colleagues with shared interests and affinities to connect and learn from one another. For example, in 2020 we formed the Women’s Initiative Network under the sponsorship of executive leaders that meets regularly, provides development opportunities and participates in external networking events.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information
Certain statements that we make from time to time, including statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference into this report, constitute “forward looking-statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “projects,” “predicts,” “foresees,” “potential” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development, commercialization and anticipated performance and benefits; regulatory approvals; impacts of acquisitions or dispositions; market position and expenditures.
Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. 
The following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements. For further discussion of these and other factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report.
•The effect of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or outbreaks of communicable diseases, on our business, financial conditions and results of operations, including the time it will take for vaccines to be broadly distributed and administered worldwide, and the effectiveness of such vaccines in slowing or stopping the spread of COVID-19 and its variants and mitigating the economic effects of the pandemic, including inflationary pressures and higher freight costs in our global supply chain;
•Failure to achieve our long-term strategic and financial-improvement goals;
•Demand for and market acceptance risks for new and existing products, including material reductions in purchasing from or loss of a significant customer;
