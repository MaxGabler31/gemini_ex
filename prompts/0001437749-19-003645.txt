We leverage our proprietary high-speed analog and mixed signal processing expertise and our deep understanding of system architectures to address data bottlenecks in current and emerging communications, enterprise network, computing and storage architectures. We develop these solutions as a result of our competitive strengths, including our system-level simulation capabilities, analog design expertise, strong relationships with industry leaders, extensive broad process technology experience and high-speed package modeling and design expertise. We use our core technology and strength in high-speed analog design to enable our customers to deploy next generation communications systems that operate with high performance at high-speed. We believe we are at the forefront of developing semiconductor solutions that deliver up to multi-Terabit speeds throughout the network infrastructure, including core, metro and the datacenter.
 
We have ongoing, informal collaborative discussions with industry and technology leaders in Tier-1 cloud providers, telecom operators, network system original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and optical module and component vendors  to design architectures and products that solve bandwidth bottlenecks in existing and next generation communications systems. Although we generally do not have any formal collaboration agreements with these entities, we often engage in informal discussions with these entities with respect to anticipated technological challenges, next generation customer requirements and industry conventions and standards. We help define industry conventions and standards within the markets we target by collaborating with technology leaders, OEMs systems manufacturers and standards bodies. Our products are designed into systems sold by OEMs, including Tier-1 OEMs in the telecom and networking system markets worldwide. We believe we are one of a limited number of suppliers to these OEMs for the type of products we sell, and in some cases we may be the sole supplier for certain applications. We sell both directly to these OEMs and to other intermediary systems or module manufacturers that, in turn, sell to these OEMs.
 
Our Business 
 
Our semiconductor solutions leverage our deep understanding of high-speed analog and mixed signal processing and our system architecture knowledge to address data bottlenecks in current and emerging network and datacenter architectures. We design and develop our products for the communications and computing markets, which typically have two to three year design cycles, and product life cycles of five or more years. We believe our leadership position in developing high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductors is a result of the following core strengths:

• | System-Level Simulation Capabilities. We design our high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductor solutions to be critical components in complex systems. In order to understand and solve system problems, we work closely with systems vendors to develop proprietary component, channel and system simulation models. We use these proprietary simulation and validation tools to accurately predict system performance prior to fabricating the semiconductor or alternatively, to identify and optimize critical semiconductor parameters to satisfy customer system requirements. We use these simulation and validation capabilities to reduce our customers’ time to market and engineering investments, thus enabling us to establish differentiated design relationships with our customers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Analog Design Expertise. We believe that we are a leader in developing broadband analog and mixed signal semiconductors operating at high frequencies of up to 100 GHz. High-speed analog circuit design is extremely challenging because, as frequencies increase, semiconductors are increasingly sensitive to temperature, power supply noise, process variation and interaction with neighboring circuit elements. Development of components that work robustly at high frequencies requires an understanding of analog circuit design, including electromagnetic theory and practical experience in implementation and testing. Our analog design expertise has enabled us to design and commercially ship several first in the world technologies including the first 100G linear transimpedance amplifier (TIA) and the first 400G linear modulator driver that is now being widely deployed in volume globally in long haul and metro networking infrastructures. We launched the world’s first 50/100/200/400G PAM4 interconnect ICs for cloud interconnects. The chipset solution included multiple variants of the PAM4 PHY IC based on a highly adaptable and scalable InphiNityCore™ digital signal processing (DSP) engine and the OmniConnect™ transmitter for copper and optics media along with a companion linear TIA for Nx50G PAM4 interfaces.

• | Strong Relationships with Industry Leaders. We develop many of our high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductor solutions for applications and systems that are driven by industry leaders in the communications, datacenter and computing markets. Through our established relationships with industry leaders, we have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to address their technological challenges. As a result, we are designed into several of their current systems and believe we are well-positioned to develop high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductor solutions for their emerging architectures. We have ongoing, informal collaborative discussions with communication, networking companies, and datacenter companies in Tier-1 cloud providers, telecom operators, network system OEMs and optical module and component vendors to address their next generation 100G and beyond 100G efforts. Specifically, we engage in informal discussions with these entities with respect to anticipated technological challenges, next generation customer requirements and industry conventions and standards. As a result of our development efforts with industry leaders, we help define industry conventions and standards within the markets we target by collaborating with technology leaders, OEMs and systems manufacturers, as well as standards bodies such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and the Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) to establish industry standards.

• | Broad Process Technology. We employ process technology experts, device technologists and circuit designers who have extensive experience in many process technologies including CMOS, SiGe, Silicon photonics (Sipho) and III-V technologies such as gallium arsenides or indium phosphide. We have developed specific internal models and design kits for each process to support a uniform design methodology across all of our semiconductor solutions. For example, our products using 16 nanometer CMOS technology require development of accurate models for sub-circuits such as integrated phase lock loops, varactors and inductors. In addition, for Sipho and III-V materials-based processes, in-house model development is a necessity and we believe also provides a substantial competitive advantage because these processes have complex material and device interactions. Combined with our fabless manufacturing strategy, our design expertise, proprietary model libraries and uniform design methodology allow us to use the best possible materials and substrates to design and develop our semiconductor solutions. We believe that our ability to design high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductors in a wide range of materials and process technologies allows us to provide superior performance, power, cost and reliability for a specific set of market requirements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High-Speed Package Modeling and Design. We have developed deep expertise in high-speed package modeling and design, since introducing the first high-speed 50 GHz MUX and DEMUX product in 2001. At high frequencies, the interaction between an analog device, its package and the external environment can significantly affect product performance. Accurately modeling and developing advanced packaging allows semiconductor solutions to address this challenge. Due to the advanced nature of this work, there is a limited supply of engineers with experience in high-speed package modeling and design, and therefore, this required expertise can be difficult to acquire for companies that have not invested in developing such a skill set. We have developed an infrastructure to simulate electrical, mechanical and thermal properties of devices and packages that we integrate within our semiconductor design process and implement at our third-party packaging providers. Modeling is an inherently iterative process, and since our model libraries are used extensively by our circuit designers, the accuracy and value of these models increases over time. Our current packaging and modeling techniques enable us to deliver semiconductors that are energy efficient, offer high-speed processing and enable advanced signal integrity, all in a small footprint.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Silicon Photonics Design Expertise. We have developed deep expertise in Silicon photonics (Sipho) and successfully commercialized the world first 100G DWDM Sipho-based solutions that consumes as little as 4.5W of power versus alternate solutions at 25W. This Sipho-based solution has been deployed in high volume at a Tier-1 Cloud vendor and continues to gain market acceptance at Tier-1 OEMs for the Enterprise and Internet Exchange customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that our system-level simulation capabilities, our analog design and broad process technology design capabilities as well as our strengths in packaging enable us to differentiate ourselves by delivering advanced high-speed analog and mixed signal processing solutions. For example, we believe we are the first vendor who has successfully commercialized DSP base 100G Ethernet PHYs running PAM4 standard CMOS process.
 
We believe the key benefits that our solutions provide to our customers are as follows:
 

• | High Performance. Our high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductor solutions are designed to meet the specific technical requirements of our customers in their respective end markets. In many cases, our close design relationships and deep engineering expertise put us in a position where we are one of a limited group of semiconductor vendors that can provide the necessary solution. For instance, in the broadband communications market, we believe our products achieve the highest signal integrity and attain superior signal transmission distance at required error-free or low error rates.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low Power and Small Footprint. In each of the end markets that we serve, the power budget of the overall system is a key consideration for systems designers. Power consumption greatly impacts system operation cost, footprint and cooling requirements, and is increasingly becoming a point of focus for our customers. We believe that our high-speed analog and mixed signal processing solutions enable our customers to implement system architectures that reduce overall system power consumption. We also believe that, at high frequencies, our high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductor devices typically consume less power than competitors’ standard designs, which often incorporate power-consuming digital signal processing to perform data transfer functions, thereby further reducing overall system power consumption. In addition, in many of our applications, we are able to design and deliver semiconductors that have a smaller footprint and therefore reduce the overall system size.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Faster Time to Market. Our customers compete in markets that require high-speed, reliable semiconductors that can be integrated into their systems as soon as new market opportunities develop. To meet our customers’ time-to-market requirements, we work closely with them early in their design cycles and are actively involved in their development processes. Over the past ten years, we have developed methodologies and simulation environments that accurately predict the behavior of complex integrated circuits within various communications systems. In addition, we have developed an extensive internal library of proven building block circuits such as amplifiers, phase frequency detectors and transmitters that are reused to shorten design cycles and reduce risk.

Our inside data center interconnects are our trucks, working across hundreds of meters up to kilometers. Our PAM interconnects along with accompanying TIAs and drivers deliver low power, cost effective solutions for cloud and enterprise customers. 
 

As of December 31, 2018, we have a wide range of products in our portfolio, including products that have commercially shipped, products for which we have shipped engineering samples and products under development, that perform a wide range of functions such as amplifying, encoding, multiplexing, demultiplexing, and retiming signals at speeds up to 400 Gbps. These products are key enablers for servers, routers, switches, storage and other equipment that process, store and transport data traffic. We introduced 45 and 28 new products in 2018 and 2017, respectively. We design and develop our products for the communications and computing markets, which typically have two to three year design cycles, and product life cycles as long as five years or more.
 
We introduced ColorZ® in 2016 and began to ship in commercial volume in 2017. Sales of ColorZ® comprised 18% and 17% of our total revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2012, we introduced and began to ship in commercial volume a dual, differential input linear transimpedance/variable-gain amplifier that we identify as product number IN3250TA-SO2D. Sales of IN3250TA-SO2D product comprised 10% and 25% of our total revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively. There were no other products that generated more than 10% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 or 2016.
 


Customers 
 
We sell our products directly to OEMs and indirectly to OEMs through module manufacturers, original design manufacturers (ODMs) and sub-systems providers. We work closely with technology leaders to design architectures and products that help solve bandwidth bottlenecks in and between systems. These technology leaders often design our products into reference designs, which they provide to their customers and suppliers. In the networking market, we work closely with OEMs to deliver high performance communication links. These OEMs design our products into their systems and then require their ODM and electronics manufacturing services suppliers to purchase and use that specific product from us. We also work directly with optical module manufacturers to design our products into their modules, which they sell to OEMs.
 
We work closely with our customers throughout design cycles that often last two to three years and we are able to develop long-term relationships with them as our technology becomes embedded in their products. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned to not only be designed into their current systems, but also to continually develop next generation high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductor solutions for their future products. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold our products to more than 100 customers.

Sales to customers in Asia accounted for 57%, 62% and 70% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Because many of our customers or their OEM manufacturers are located in Asia, we anticipate that a majority of our future revenue will continue to come from sales to that region. Although a large percentage of our sales are made to customers in Asia, we believe that a significant number of the systems designed by these customers and incorporating our semiconductor products are then sold to end-users outside Asia.
 
We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we believe that sales to Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (Huawei), and Cisco Systems, Inc. (Cisco), directly and indirectly, through subcontractors, accounted for approximately 18%, 14%, and 11% of our total revenue, respectively, and that our 10 largest direct customers collectively accounted for 74% of our total revenue.  Included in the 10 largest direct customers is sales to Cyberlink which is 11% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. We sell products to Cyberlink Electronics Limited (Cyberlink), a distributor who sells to various end customers.  In the year ended December 31, 2017, we believe that sales to Microsoft, Huawei, and Cisco, directly and indirectly, through subcontractors, accounted for approximately 17%, 14%, and 11% of our total revenue, respectively, and that our 10 largest direct customers collectively accounted for 70% of our total revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we believe that sales to Huawei and Cisco, directly and indirectly, through subcontractors, accounted for approximately 16% and 12% of our total revenue, respectively and that our 10 largest direct customers collectively accounted for 73% of our total revenue. No other single customer directly or indirectly accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 or 2016.
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
Our design cycle from initial engagement to volume shipment is typically two to three years, with product life cycles in the markets we serve ranging from five to 10 years or more. For many of our products, early engagement with our customers’ technical staff is necessary for success. To ensure an adequate level of early engagement, our application and development engineers work closely with our customers to identify and propose solutions to their systems challenges.
 

In addition to our direct customers, we work closely with technology leaders in Tier-1 cloud providers, telecom operators, network system OEMs and optical module and component vendors for the datacenter, networking and communications market to anticipate and solve next generation challenges facing our customers. As part of the sales and product development process, we often design our products in close collaboration with these industry leaders and help define their architecture. We also participate actively in setting industry standards with organizations such as IEEE and OIF to have a voice in the definition of future market trends.
 
We sell our products worldwide through multiple channels, including our direct sales force and a network of sales representatives and distributors. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 84% of our revenue was generated by our direct sales team and third-party sales representatives. We operate marketing representative offices in China, Japan, Taiwan, Germany, and the United States and employ marketing personnel that meet with our customers locally and interact with our channel partners locally.  Our channel network includes more than one hundred sales and support professionals to support our products and customers. All of these sales professionals are sales agents and are employed by our distributors and sales representatives. We believe these distributors and sales representatives have the requisite technical experience in our target markets and are able to leverage existing relationships and understanding of our customers’ products to effectively sell our products. Given the breadth of our target markets, customers and products, we provide our direct and indirect sales teams with regular training and share product information with our customers and sales team using web-based tools.
 
Manufacturing 
 
We operate a fabless business model and use third-party foundries and assembly and test manufacturing contractors to manufacture, assemble and test our semiconductor products. We also inspect and test certain parts in our Irvine and Westlake Village, California facilities. This outsourced manufacturing approach allows us to focus our resources on the design, sale and marketing of our products. In addition, we believe outsourcing many of our manufacturing and assembly activities provides us the flexibility needed to respond to new market opportunities, simplifies our operations and significantly reduces our capital requirements.
 
We subject our third-party manufacturing contractors to qualification requirements in order to meet the high quality and reliability standards required of our products. We carefully qualify critical partners and processes before applying the technology to our products. Our engineers work closely with our foundries and other contractors to increase yield, lower manufacturing costs and improve product quality.
 

• | Wafer Fabrication. We currently utilize a wide range of semiconductor processes to develop and manufacture our products. Each of our foundries tends to specialize in a particular semiconductor wafer process technology. We choose the semiconductor process and foundry that we believe provides the best combination of performance attributes for any particular product. For most of our products, we utilize a single foundry for semiconductor wafer production. Our international headquarters in Singapore purchases all wafer material and owns the material until the manufacturing process is complete and the product is shipped to a customer either inside or outside North America or to physical inventory for the respective region. Our principal foundries are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSMC) in Taiwan, WIN Semiconductors Corp. in Taiwan, TowerJazz Semiconductor Ltd. in North America and GlobalFoundries in North America.

• | Package and Assembly. Upon the completion of processing at the foundry, the finished wafers are shipped to our third-party assemblers for packaging and assembly. Currently, our principal packaging and assembly contractors are STATS ChipPAC Ltd. in Korea, Kyocera Corporation in Japan, Tong Hsing Electronics Industries Ltd. in Taiwan, Amkor Technology in Korea, LuxNet Corporation in Taiwan and ASE Technology in Taiwan and Malaysia.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Test. At the last stage of integrated circuit production, our third-party test service providers test the packaged and assembled integrated circuits. Currently, STATS ChipPAC in Korea, ISE Labs in North America, Giga Solution Tech in Taiwan, WIN Semiconductors Corp. in Taiwan, ASEM Technology in Malaysia and Presto Engineering in North America are our test partners. We also perform testing in our Irvine and Westlake Village, California facilities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

We are committed to maintaining the highest level of quality in our products. Our objective is that our products meet all of our customer requirements, are delivered on-time and function reliably throughout their useful lives. As part of our total quality assurance program, our quality management system has been certified to ISO 9001:2008 standards. Our manufacturing partners are also ISO 9001 certified.
 
Research and Development 
 
We focus our research and development efforts on developing products that address bandwidth bottlenecks in networks and minimize latency in computing environments. We believe that our continued success depends on our ability to both introduce improved versions of our existing products and to develop new products for the markets that we serve. We devote a portion of our resources to expanding our core technology including efforts in system-level simulation, high-speed analog design, supporting a broad range of process technologies and high-speed package modeling and design.
 
We develop models that are used as an input to a combination of proprietary and commercially available simulation tools. We use these tools to predict overall system performance based on the performance of our product. After our product is manufactured, we perform system measurements and refine our model set to improve the model’s accuracy and predictive ability. As a result, our models and simulation tools have improved over time and we have been able to accurately predict overall system performance prior to fabricating a part.
 
We have assembled a core team of experienced engineers and systems designers in eight design centers located in the United States, Canada, Germany, Singapore, United Kingdom and Argentina. Our technical team typically has, on average, more than 21 years of industry experience with more than 53% having advanced degrees (master’s degree and above) and more than 22% having Ph.Ds. These engineers and designers are involved in advancing our core technologies, as well as applying these core technologies to our product development activities across a number of areas including telecommunications transport systems, enterprise networking equipment, datacenters and enterprise servers, storage platforms, test and measurement and military systems.
 
Competition 
 
The global semiconductor market in general, and the communications market in particular, are highly competitive. We expect competition to increase and intensify as more and larger semiconductor companies enter our markets. Increased competition could result in price pressure, reduced profitability and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue and operating results.
 
Currently, our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets. Our primary competitors include Acacia Communications, Inc., Broadcom Ltd., Integrated Device Technology, Inc., M/A-COM Technology Solutions Inc., MaxLinear, Inc., Microchip Technology Incorporated, NTT Electronics Corporation, Qorvo, Inc. and Semtech Corp. as well as other smaller analog and mixed signal processing companies. We expect competition in our target markets to increase in the future as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings.
 
Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including industry and general economic trends. During past periods of downturns in our industry, competition in the markets in which we operate intensified as our customers reduced their purchase orders. Many of our competitors are significantly larger, have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support and other resources, are more established than we are, and have significantly better brand recognition and broader product offerings with which to withstand similar adverse economic or market conditions in the future. These developments may materially and adversely affect our current and future target markets and our ability to compete successfully in those markets.

--+-------

 
We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. We maintain our competitive position through our ability to successfully design, develop and market complex high-speed analog and mixed signal solutions for the customers that we serve.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, and contractual protections, to protect our core technology and intellectual property. As of December 31, 2018, we had 788 issued and allowed patents and other patent applications pending in the United States. The 718 issued and allowed patents in the United States expire in the years beginning in 2019 through 2038. Many of our issued patents and pending patent applications relate to high-speed circuit and package designs.
 
We may not receive competitive advantages from any rights granted under our patents, and our patent applications may not result in the issuance of any patents. In addition, any future patent may be opposed, contested, circumvented, designed around by a third party or found to be unenforceable or invalidated. Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies, duplicate our proprietary technologies or design around patents owned or licensed by us.
 
In addition to our own intellectual property, we also use third-party licensors for certain technologies embedded in our semiconductor solutions. These are typically non-exclusive contracts provided under paid-up licenses. These licenses are generally perpetual or automatically renewed for so long as we continue to pay any maintenance fees that may be due. To date, maintenance fees have not constituted a significant portion of our annual capital expenditures. We have entered into a number of licensing arrangements pursuant to which we license third-party technologies. We do not believe our business is dependent to any significant degree on any individual third-party license.
 
We generally control access to and use of our confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors and customers. We rely in part on United States and international copyright laws to protect our mask work. All employees and consultants are required to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment and consulting relationships with us. We also require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived or made in connection with the employment or consulting relationship.
 
Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary intellectual property. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
 
The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions, which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. We have in the past received and, particularly as a public company, we expect that in the future we may receive, communications from various industry participants alleging our infringement of their patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights. Any lawsuits could subject us to significant liability for damages, invalidate our proprietary rights and harm our business and our ability to compete. Any litigation, regardless of success or merit, could cause us to incur substantial expenses, reduce our sales and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. In the event we receive an adverse result in any litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, seek licenses from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, cease sale of products, expend significant resources to develop alternative technology or discontinue the use of processes requiring the relevant technology.

Cybersecurity
 
We have designed and implemented and continue to maintain a security program consisting of policies, procedures, and technology meant to maintain the privacy, security and integrity of our information, systems, and networks. Among other things, the program includes controls designed to limit and monitor access to authorized systems, networks, and data, prevent inappropriate access or modification, and monitor for threats or vulnerability.

At December 31, 2018, we employed 580 full-time equivalent employees, including 385 in research, product development and engineering, 48 in sales and marketing, 55 in general and administrative management and 92 in manufacturing engineering and operations.
