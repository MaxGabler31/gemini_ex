ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Organization

On September 14, 2009, the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. Until the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we were engaged in the business of acquisition, exploration and development of natural resource properties. On April 17, 2018, under the laws of the State of Nevada, we changed our name from “Lash, Inc.” to “Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc.” On October 19, 2016, under the laws of the State of Nevada, we changed our name from “Cassidy Ventures Inc.” to “Lash, Inc.”

Amber Joy Finney has served as our President and Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer and sole director since September 28, 2016. Ms. Finney is also the holder of 2,271,429 shares of our common stock, amounting to 51.6% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. William Drury has served as our Secretary since February 19, 2013.

William Drury also served as our Treasurer and sole director from February 19, 2013, until September 28, 2016. Mr. Drury also served as our President from July 31, 2015 until September 28, 2016.

As of June 30, 2022, we were authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, and 25,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.

Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement raising substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.

Our Business – and Immediate Need for Financing

On July 15, 2021, we acquired the assets of Paleo Scavenger, LLC for $10,000. Paleo owns the Within / Without Granola (“WWG”) brand. The purchase price includes the WWG trademarks, brands, books, records, intellectual property, commercial sales channel, customer lists and manufacturing rights. Early in 2021, WWG ceased operations and we restarted the manufacturing process in June 2022.

We generated our first sales since inception during August 2022 of approximately $600. We are currently selling our granola products on Shopify. In addition, we are in the process of qualifying to sell our products on Amazon.

We must raise at least $100,000 to commence our plan of operation, described above, and fund our ongoing operational expenses. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. If that financing is not available, we may be unable to continue our operations. Management believes that if we are successful in raising $100,000, we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, if such financing is not available, we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. Management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful, we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements.

If we are unsuccessful in raising at least $100,000 through a private placement, we will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be highly difficult for a new, development stage business to obtain. Therefore, the Company is highly dependent upon the success of an anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in the Company having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing, which may not even be available to the Company. However, if such financing were available, because we are a development stage company with little in the way of operations to date, we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high-risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. If and when these funds are obtained, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load. If we cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of our common stock or secure debt financing, we would be required to cease business operations and as a result, investors in our common stock would lose all of their investment.
