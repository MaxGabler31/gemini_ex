Steel Industry Background and Competition
The global steel industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by global overcapacity.
U. S. Steel's competitive position may be affected by, among other things, differences among U. S. Steel's and its competitors' cost structure, labor costs, environmental remediation and compliance costs, global capacity, achievement of innovations in new technologies and sustainable products and the existence and magnitude of government subsidies provided to competitors.
U. S. Steel competes with many North American and international steel producers. Competitors include 1) integrated producers, which use iron ore and coke as the primary raw materials for steel production, 2) EAF producers, which primarily use steel scrap and other iron-bearing feedstocks as raw materials and 3) slab re-rollers, who purchase mostly imported, but some domestic, semi-finished products and convert them into sheet products. In addition, other materials, such as aluminum, plastics and composites, compete with steel in several applications. According to worldsteel Association, global steel production in 2021 grew compared to 2020, increasing by 4% or approximately 70 million metric tons to 1.951 billion metric tons. Steel production generally increased across the world, with the global increase being driven collectively by countries outside of the top five steel producing countries. Among the top five steel producing countries, production increased in India, the United States, Japan and Russia. This growth was partially offset however by China, which decreased crude steel production by 32 million metric tons, or 3%, from 2020. The top five steel producing countries accounted for 72% of the world's steel production in 2021, and China was the only major steel producing country to have decreased production during 2021.
See "International Trade" below for a discussion of global overcapacity and the Company's efforts to mitigate the competitive impact. 
EAF producers typically require lower capital expenditures for construction and operation of facilities and may have lower total employment costs; however, these competitive advantages may be minimized or eliminated by the cost of scrap when scrap prices are high. Some EAF producers utilize thin slab casting technology to produce flat-rolled products and are increasingly able to compete directly with integrated producers in many flat-rolled product applications previously produced only by integrated steelmakers. Slab re-rollers do not incur the cost of melting steel; their input costs are largely driven by the market price of slabs.
U. S. Steel provides defined benefit pension and/or other post-employment benefits to approximately 70,000 current employees, retirees and their beneficiaries. Many of our competitors do not have comparable retiree obligations. Participation in U. S. Steel's main defined benefit pension plan was closed to new entrants on July 1, 2003 and benefit accruals for all non-represented participants were frozen effective December 31, 2015. Participation in U. S. Steel’s retiree medical and life insurance programs for United Steelworkers (USW)-represented employees were closed to employees hired or rehired (except in limited circumstances) on or after January 1, 2016. Retiree medical and life insurance benefits for non-represented employees were eliminated for those who retired after December 31, 2017.
We believe that our major North American and many European integrated steel competitors are confronted with substantially similar environmental regulatory conditions and therefore do not believe that our relative position with regard to such competitors will be materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations. However, if future regulations do not recognize that the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions without linking these emissions to steel scrap as well, the competitive position of our integrated operations will be adversely impacted compared to mini mills. Our competitive position compared to producers in developing nations such as China, Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Brazil and India, will be harmed unless such nations require commensurate reductions in CO2 emissions or there are policies to adjust for the carbon emissions disparities. Competing materials such as plastics may not be similarly impacted. The specific impact on each competitor will vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods. U. S. Steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to former and present operating locations and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. Many of our competitors, including North American producers, or their successors, that have been the subject of bankruptcy relief have no or substantially lower liabilities for such environmental remediation matters.
In 2022, we expect additional steelmaking capacity will enter the domestic steel market as competitors' growth projects come on-line in North America throughout the year.
Business Strategy
We are executing on our customer-centric Best for All strategy to advance a more secure, sustainable future for U. S. Steel and its stakeholders. Our strategy is focused on product and process innovation by investing where we have distinct cost or capability competitive advantages. We are expanding our competitive advantages in low-cost iron ore, mini mill steelmaking, and world-class finishing assets with innovative solutions and commercial acumen. These competitive advantages are built on a foundation of research, innovation and deep customer relationships. In executing our strategy, we aim to enhance our earnings profile, deliver long-term cash flow through industry cycles and reduce our capital and carbon intensity. By offering the product capabilities, including the more sustainable steels (steels made with lower greenhouse gas emissions) our customers are increasingly demanding, we can achieve more competitive positioning in strategic, high-margin end markets, and deliver high-quality, sustainable, value-added products and innovative solutions.
Our strategy is informed by our critical success factors, which are the bedrock of the Best for All strategy: (1) Move Down the Cost Curve; (2) Win in Strategic Markets; and (3) Move Up the Talent Curve. We are investing in new technologies to improve our cost position and increase our capabilities, including our mini mill steelmaking and best-in-class finishing capabilities. We will focus on strategic markets, where there is the greatest opportunity to provide differentiated, innovative and value-added solutions that will help our customers succeed. We know that to accomplish our objectives, we also need to move up the talent curve. We are investing in our employees and providing the training and resources they need to succeed. This will help us reinforce a culture where accountability, fairness and respect are foundational, and high performance and inclusion in all its forms are valued and celebrated.
U. S. Steel will continue to evaluate potential strategic and organizational opportunities, which may include the acquisition, divestiture or consolidation of assets. Given the cyclicality of our industry, we are focused on strategically deploying our capital in order to invest in areas consistent with the execution of our Best for All strategy and are considering various possibilities, including exiting lines of business and the sale of certain assets, that we believe would ultimately result in greater stockholder value. The Company will pursue opportunities based on its long-term strategy, and what the Board of Directors determines to be in the best interests of the Company's stockholders at the time. 
Strategic Projects, Technology Investments and Operating Configuration Adjustments
2021 was a strategically transformational year as we move towards Best for All. On January 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Big River Steel, which increased our annual raw steel production capability by 3.3 million net tons. In addition, we commenced construction on a non-grain oriented (NGO) electrical steel line at Big River Steel in August 2021. We expect this $450 million investment to make Big River Steel a leader in NGO electric steels by delivering product capabilities in this growing market. The 200,000 ton NGO electrical steel line is expected to deliver first coil in September 2023 and be available to meet the growing electric vehicle demand expected in North America over the coming years.
In the third quarter 2021, the Company began construction on a 325,000 ton galvaneal/galvalume line at Big River Steel. This $280 million investment is expected to grow the Company’s best-in-class finishing capabilities, by expanding the Company’s presence in value-added construction applications and enhancing Big River Steel’s product mix.
On January 11, 2022, we announced Osceola, Arkansas as the site of a new highly sustainable and technologically advanced steel mill. The planned mini mill is expected to have 3 million tons per year of steelmaking capability, and will combine two state-of-the-art EAFs with differentiated steelmaking and finishing technology, including our already purchased endless casting and rolling equipment. The Company is working with the same technical advisors and engineers who were instrumental in the successful construction of the facilities at Big River Steel. The continued adoption of mini mill technology will expand our ability to produce the next generation of highly profitable proprietary sustainable steel solutions, including Advanced High Strength Steels.
As the Company advances and expands its mini mill capability, it seeks to become better, not bigger and will adjust its footprint accordingly by re-evaluating non-core and less efficient capabilities. In December 2021, the Company permanently idled the steelmaking operations at its Great Lakes Works facility. The coil finishing process continues to operate and the iron making process at Great Lakes Works remains idled for an indefinite period of time.
On July 28, 2021, we continued the transition to Best for All by monetizing non-core assets with the sale of Transtar, our wholly owned short-line railroad, while concurrently entering into a long-term rail services agreement with the purchaser of Transtar. 
Commercial Strategy
Our commercial strategy is focused on providing customer-centric solutions with differentiated and value-added steel products, which includes advanced high strength steels such as our newer grades of GEN3 steel, coated sheets for the automotive and appliance industries, electrical steel sheets for the manufacture of motors and electrical equipment, both bare and prepainted galvanized and Galvalume® sheets for construction, heavy gauge hot rolled coils used in the production of construction and agricultural-related heavy machinery as well as skelp for line pipe used for energy transmission, tin mill products for the packaging industry and OCTG pipe, connections, accessories and rig site services for use in drilling for oil and gas. In addition, 
our portfolio of customers serve a variety of different traditional and emerging industries meeting the needs of numerous markets.
Throughout 2021, the Company integrated the commercial teams from United States Steel and Big River Steel into a single, customer-focused commercial team to better serve our customers and leverage the collective footprint of our legacy and mini mill capabilities. The aligned commercial structure allows us to increase our relationships with customers, provide seamless customer access to application and product engineering, and to be nimble and more responsive in the marketplace. 
U. S. Steel is committed to leveraging our Best for All strategy to develop and commercialize low-carbon footprint and advanced high-strength steels for our current and future customers. Over the next five years, U. S. Steel plans to develop and commercialize numerous differentiated grades of low-carbon footprint, high rate of recycled-content steels, providing compelling new options for customers in automotive, appliance, industrial equipment, construction, renewable energy and other markets to enhance the sustainability of their products. For example, in April 2021, we announced a new sustainable steel product line, verdeXTM, which is produced with up to 70% less greenhouse gas emissions compared to similar products produced through integrated steelmaking. In addition, we are collaborating with Norfolk Southern Corporation and The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. on a new, sustainable high-strength steel railcar designed to extend the useful life of each gondola and increase freight capacity.
We are responsive to our customers' changing needs by developing new steel products and uses for steel that meet their evolving markets and regulatory demands. We have research centers in Munhall, Pennsylvania, Košice, Slovakia, and Houston, Texas, as well as a technology center in Troy, Michigan. The focus of these centers is to engineer new products and to co-create innovative solutions that meet our customers' toughest challenges to reduce carbon emissions, increase strength, improve longevity and serve the needs of their customers.
For automotive customers leveraging advanced high strength steels, we commissioned a first of its kind GEN3 hot dipped galvanize line at our PRO-TEC Coating Company (PRO-TEC) joint venture in 2020, and have embedded application engineers at original equipment manufacturers to demonstrate how to best utilize the high strength, highly formable, cost effective material in body design to meet passenger safety requirements while significantly reducing weight to meet future vehicle fuel efficiency standards.
In our tubular markets, we continue development of premium and semi-premium tubular connections designed for our customers that operate in challenging drilling environments. These connections optimize well construction activities and provide outstanding sealing capabilities for onshore and offshore oil and gas drilling in North America. An example is the USS-TALON HTQ™, which was introduced in 2020 for customers that are constructing onshore natural gas and oil wells with long laterals requiring best-in-class torque capacity and optimized well-bore clearances.
Commercial Sales of Product 
U. S. Steel characterizes sales as contract sales if sold pursuant to an agreement with a defined volume and pricing and a duration of longer than three months, and as spot if sold without a defined volume and pricing agreement, typically three months or less. In 2021, approximately 73 percent, 81 percent, 49 percent and 48 percent of sales by Flat-Rolled, Mini Mill, USSE and Tubular, respectively, were contract sales. Some contract pricing agreements include fixed prices while others are adjusted periodically based upon published prices of steel products or cost components. 
Human Capital Management
At U. S. Steel, we are focused on attracting and retaining the top talent needed to support our strategic transformation and meet our customers’ evolving needs as a sustainable steel solutions provider. The support and development of our people is foundational to achieving our Best for All strategy. We refer to this strategic talent pillar as “Moving Up the Talent Curve.”
Our focus on people extends to our current and future employees. We aim to have an engaged and diverse workforce to promote new ideas and innovation, reflect the communities where we operate, and deliver exceptional customer service. We seek to build an inclusive environment where people feel free to bring their whole selves to work. To achieve the Best for All strategy, we must have the “Best from All.”

Approximate Active Employees as of December 31, 2021

Ethics & Compliance
Our culture is based on our S.T.E.E.L. Principles: Safety First; Trust and Respect; Environmental Stewardship; Excellence and Accountability; and Lawful and Ethical Conduct. We expect our employees and members of our board of directors to take 
personal responsibility to “do what’s right,” and our Code of Ethical Business Conduct serves as the foundation for the actions of our employees and directors. To further ensure that employees understand the Company’s expectations and all applicable rules, we provide formal ethics and compliance training to our employees and have frequent communication with information about key compliance topics, which include messages from senior management underscoring the importance of doing business with integrity. Employees also receive summaries of current events that demonstrate the need to do business lawfully that include reminders of the company’s expectations for all employees. In addition, through our annual policy certification process, employees and directors certify their ongoing compliance with our Code of Ethical Business Conduct.
Employee Health & Safety
At U. S. Steel, we have a long-standing commitment to the safety and health of every person who works in our facilities. Every employee deserves to return home safely at the end of every day, and we are working to eliminate all injuries and incidents. In addition, the psychological safety of all employees is important to us. We have combined physical safety and psychological safety into the construct of 360° safety. Ensuring a safe workplace also improves productivity, quality, reliability and financial performance. By making safety and health a personal responsibility, our employees are making a daily commitment to follow safe work practices, look out for the safety of co-workers and ensure safe working conditions for everyone. A “Safety First” mindset is as essential to our success as the tools and technologies we rely on to do business. This past year, we relied on our strong safety culture to ensure the health and safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, as described below.
Our objective is to attain a sustainable zero harm culture supported by leadership and owned by an engaged and highly skilled workforce, empowered with the capabilities and resources needed to assess, reduce, and eliminate workplace risks and hazards. In support of these objectives, we have developed an enhanced Safety Management System, initiated new safety communication methods and enhanced contractor safety processes. One of our most important safety protocols is our fatality prevention audit program. These proactive assessments of the processes and protocols we have in place, and adherence to them, to avoid fatalities and severe injuries are conducted annually at the enterprise level and more frequently at each of our facilities. We assess our safety performance through a variety of lagging and leading indicators, including OSHA Days Away From Work (DAFW). This measurement allows us to evaluate the frequency of injuries sustained at our facilities requiring an employee to stay at home for more than one day. U. S. Steel has achieved record-safety performance in this measurement in the last several years, routinely achieving performance better than industry benchmarks.
For 2021, we had a corporate DAFW rate of 0.06, which is 0.64 better than the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Iron and Steel benchmark DAFW rate of 0.70.
The health and safety of our workforce remains our top priority as we continue to monitor the spread of the coronavirus pandemic across the globe. Building on the steps we took at the onset of the pandemic in 2020, some of the measures we implemented in 2021 included:
•Issuing regular communications and videos, including preventive tips;
•Providing employees with protective equipment, masks, and sanitizing and cleaning supplies and enhanced cleaning frequency; and
•Hosting vaccination clinics at our facilities, offering our employees convenient access to the COVID-19 vaccine.
Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion
Attracting, developing, and retaining a workforce of talented, diverse people is essential to having high-performing teams that drive results for our Company’s stakeholders. As part of our commitment to cultivating a culture of caring, we have inclusive benefits available for our U.S. non-represented workforce, including expanded parental leave, back-up dependent care, infertility coverage, gender reassignment coverage and healthcare continuation for the families of employees who suffered work-related or military service fatalities. In 2021, U. S. Steel again earned a 100 percent score on the Human Rights Campaign’s annual Corporate Equality Index in recognition of our comprehensive benefits, non-discrimination policies and inclusive culture support. We also support several employee resource groups (ERGs) to enhance employee engagement, promote a culture of belonging, foster diversity in the workplace, and raise awareness related to issues of identity and intersectionality. Our ERGs also provide training and education, mentorship and networking opportunities for their members.
Talent Attraction, Development and Retention 
We believe that attraction, development and retention of talent is essential to our success, especially in today’s environment. We offer internship programs, partner with universities, community colleges, and technical schools; and collaborate with community employment centers and economic development nonprofit organizations to build strong and diverse internal and external sources for potential employees.
Once at U. S. Steel, we seek to provide opportunities for continuous learning and development. All of our employees at a director-level and above have a formal professional development plan that is assessed at least annually. In addition, we proactively monitor our attrition rates and take targeted actions to ensure our highest potential and performing employees are motivated to remain with the Company. Over the past five years, our regrettable voluntary turnover rate has been at or below 5 percent.
We offer a competitive total rewards package of compensation and benefits that we regularly evaluate and benchmark across the manufacturing industry to ensure that we position U. S. Steel as an employer of choice.
At the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, we quickly transitioned our corporate and administrative employees, approximately 10% of our workforce, to a work-from-home environment. We’ve invested in technology to maintain this virtual community and found that our employees are more productive and have more flexibility and autonomy in managing their workload in a way that best fits their situation. We plan to maintain a virtual / hybrid working option for these employees in order to promote workplace flexibility and attract and retain highly qualified employees across the country.
Labor Relations 
Approximately 80% of our employees in North America and Slovakia are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We work closely with union representatives to provide safe and productive workplaces that enable our employees to deliver high-quality products and meet the needs of our customers. Our partnership with the United Steelworkers includes not only a commitment to safety programs, but also a common approach to combating the unfairly traded imports that threaten our industry, our company, and ultimately the jobs of our employees.
Capital Structure, Liquidity and Capital Allocation
Our Best for All strategy's primary financial goal is to enhance stockholder value by utilizing our capital structure, liquidity and enhanced capital allocation priorities to advance the Company's strategic objectives, generate long-term value, and reward stockholders. Our cash deployment strategy is aligned with our corporate strategy and includes: executing on strategic projects and portfolio moves; maintaining a strong balance sheet and a healthy pension plan; and delivering sustainable growth with a focus on core values such as safety and environmental stewardship and rewarding stockholders for the continued progress we make. Cash deployment is also performed with a customer-centric focus on improving safety, quality, delivery and cost.
Our liquidity supports our ability to satisfy short-term obligations, fund working capital requirements, and provides a foundation to execute key strategic priorities. We are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and may proactively refinance or repay our debt from time to time to protect our capital structure from unforeseen external events and re-financing risks.
In 2021, we undertook several steps to support these goals. 
We transformed our balance sheet and enhanced the Company's financial flexibility by repaying approximately $3.1 billion in debt.
We designated our three global syndicated revolving credit facilities as Sustainability Linked Loans to incorporate our sustainability related goals and values into our global syndicated revolving credit facilities:
•On July 23, 2021, Big River Steel entered into an amendment to its senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (Big River Steel ABL Facility), which extended the maturity by 5 years and added sustainability targets related to carbon reduction, safety performance and facility certification by ResponsibleSteel™. The Big River Steel ABL Facility provides for borrowings for working capital and general corporate purposes in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) $350 million and (b) a borrowing base calculated based on specified percentages of eligible accounts receivables and inventory, subject to certain adjustments and reserves. The Big River Steel ABL Facility matures on July 23, 2026. 
•On July 23, 2021, U. S. Steel amended the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Facility Agreement (Credit Facility Agreement) to include targets related to carbon reduction, safety performance and facility certification by ResponsibleSteel™. In addition to the new sustainability link, the Credit Facility Agreement was amended to reduce the facility size to $1.75 billion from $2 billion, which supports the Company’s current footprint and is consistent with its efforts to optimize its global liquidity position.

Other
U. S. Steel’s Other category includes the operating results relating to our real estate operations, the previously held equity method investment in Big River Steel, and our former railroad business. The Company owns approximately 45,000 acres of real estate assets, either held for development or managed, in Alabama, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania.
Raw Materials and Energy
As an integrated producer, U. S. Steel’s primary raw materials are iron units in the form of iron ore pellets and sinter ore, carbon units in the form of coal and coke (which is produced from coking coal) and steel scrap. As an EAF producer, our primary raw material is scrap. U. S. Steel’s raw materials supply strategy consists of acquiring and expanding captive sources of certain primary raw materials and entering into flexible supply contracts for certain other raw materials at competitive market prices which are subject to fluctuations based on market conditions at the time.
The amounts of such raw materials needed to produce a ton of steel will fluctuate based upon the specifications of the final steel products, the quality of raw materials and, to a lesser extent, differences among steel producing equipment. In broad terms, the Company's integrated steel process consumes approximately 1.4 tons of coal to produce one ton of coke and then it consumes approximately 0.3 tons of coke, 0.3 tons of steel scrap (approximately 60 percent of which is internally generated) and 1.3 tons of iron ore pellets to produce one ton of raw steel. At normal operating levels, we also consume approximately 6 mmbtu’s of natural gas per ton produced. Generally, the Company's mini mill operations consumes approximately 0.8 tons of steel scrap, 0.3 tons of pig iron, and 0.1 tons of HBI to produce one ton of raw steel. In addition, the mini mill operations consume approximately 0.6 MKWH of electricity per ton of raw steel produced. While we believe that these estimated consumption amounts are useful for planning purposes, and are presented to give a general sense of raw material and energy consumption related to steel production, substantial variations may occur.
Iron Ore
(a) Includes our share of production from Hibbing through December 31, 2020 and Tilden Mining Company, L.C. (Tilden) to September 29, 2017. U. S. Steel's ownership interest in Tilden was sold on September 29, 2017. 
The iron ore facilities at Minntac and Keetac contain approximately 900 million short tons of indicated resources and probable reserves and our share of recoverable reserves at the Hibbing joint venture is approximately 5 million short tons. Refer to Supplementary Information on Mineral Reserves Other than Oil and Gas in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Recoverable reserves are defined as the tons of product that can be used internally or delivered to a customer after considering mining and beneficiation or preparation losses. Minntac and Keetac’s annual capability and our share of annual capability for the Hibbing joint venture total approximately 24 million tons. We have iron ore pellet production capability that exceeds our steelmaking capability in the U.S. 
We sold iron ore pellets in 2021, 2020 and 2019 to third parties. The Company has agreements to supply iron ore pellets to third-party customers over the next several years. 
Substantially all of USSE’s iron ore requirements are purchased from outside sources, primarily Russian and Ukrainian mining companies. Prices are determined in long-term contracts with strategic suppliers or as spot prices negotiated monthly or quarterly. USSE also has received iron ore from U. S. Steel’s iron ore facilities in North America. We believe that supplies of iron ore adequate to meet USSE’s needs are available at competitive market prices.
Coking Coal
All of U. S. Steel’s coal requirements for our cokemaking facilities are purchased from outside sources. Pricing for Flat-Rolled's coking coal contracts are typically negotiated on a yearly basis, and from time to time we have entered into multi-year agreements for a portion of our coking coal requirements. 
Prices for European contracts are negotiated quarterly, annually or determined as index-based prices.
We believe that supplies of coking coal adequate to meet our needs are available from outside sources at competitive market prices. The main source of coking coal for Flat-Rolled is the United States, and sources for USSE include Poland, the Czech Republic, Russia, Ukraine, Canada, Mozambique and the United States.
Coke
In North America, the Flat-Rolled segment operates a cokemaking facility at the Clairton Plant of Mon Valley Works. At our Granite City Works, we have a 15-year coke supply agreement with Gateway that expires on December 31, 2024. Blast furnace injection of coal, and self-generated coke oven gas is also used to reduce coke usage. 
With Flat-Rolled’s cokemaking facilities and the Gateway long-term supply agreement, it has the capability to be nearly self-sufficient with respect to its annual coke requirements at normal operating levels. Coke from time to time has been purchased from, sold to, or swapped with suppliers and other end-users to adjust for production needs and reduce transportation costs.
In Europe, the USSE segment operates cokemaking facilities at USSK. While USSE is self-sufficient for coke at normal operating levels, it periodically purchases coke from Polish and Czech coke producers to meet production needs. Volume and price are negotiated quarterly.
Steel Scrap and Other Materials
We believe that supplies of steel scrap and alloys that are adequate to meet our needs are readily available from outside sources at competitive market prices for the Flat-Rolled, Mini Mill, and USSE segments. Generally, approximately 55 percent of our steel scrap requirements were internally generated through normal operations for these segments. 
Limestone
All of Flat-Rolled’s limestone requirements and USSE's lime and limestone requirements are purchased from outside sources. We believe that supplies of limestone and lime adequate to meet our needs are readily available from outside sources at competitive market prices.
Zinc and Tin
We believe that supplies of zinc and tin required to fulfill the requirements for Flat-Rolled, Mini Mill, and USSE are available from outside sources at competitive market prices. For Flat-Rolled and Mini Mill the main sources of zinc are Canada, Mexico, and the United States and the main sources of tin are Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru. For USSE, the main sources of zinc are Finland, Netherlands, Germany, Poland and Slovakia and the main sources of tin are Bolivia, Indonesia, Peru and China. 
During 2021, Flat-Rolled protected approximately 40% and 50% of its operation's zinc and tin purchases, respectively, with financial swap derivatives to manage exposure to zinc and tin price fluctuations. During 2021, USSE protected approximately 12% of its operation's zinc purchases with forward physical contracts to manage our exposure to zinc price fluctuations and protected approximately 41% of its operation's tin purchases with financial swaps to manage our exposure to tin price fluctuations. For further information, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Natural Gas
All of U. S. Steel’s natural gas requirements are purchased from outside sources.
We believe that adequate supplies to meet Flat-Rolled’s, Mini Mill's, and Tubular's needs are available at competitive market prices. For 2021, approximately 66 percent of our natural gas purchases in Flat-Rolled were based on bids solicited on a monthly basis from various vendors; the remainder were made daily or with term agreements.
We believe that adequate natural gas supplies to meet USSE’s needs are available at competitive market prices. During 2021, we routinely executed fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts for natural gas to partially manage our exposure to natural gas price increases. For 2021, approximately 48 percent of our natural gas purchases in USSE were made with fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts; the remainder were based on bids solicited on a quarterly or monthly basis from various vendors.
Both Flat-Rolled and USSE use self-generated coke oven and blast furnace gas to reduce consumption of natural gas. USSE also captures and consumes converter gas from its four steelmaking vessels.
Industrial Gases
U. S. Steel purchases industrial gas in the U.S. under long-term contracts with various suppliers. USSE owns and operates its own industrial gas facility, but also may purchase industrial gases from time to time from third parties.
International Trade
U. S. Steel continues to face import competition, much of which is unfairly traded, supported by foreign governments, and fueled by massive global steel overcapacity, currently estimated to be over 400 million metric tons per year—more than four times the entire U.S. steel market and over thirteen times total U.S. steel imports. These imports and overcapacity, impact the Company’s operational and financial performance. U. S. Steel continues to lead efforts to address these challenges that threaten the Company, our workers, our stockholders, and our country’s national and economic security. 
As of the date of this filing, pursuant to a series of Presidential Proclamations issued in accordance with Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, U.S. imports of certain steel products are subject to a 25 percent tariff, except: (1) imports from Argentina, Brazil, and South Korea, which are subject to restrictive quotas; (2) imports from the European Union (EU) that are melted and poured in the EU, within quarterly tariff-rate quota (TRQ) limits; (3) imports from Canada and Mexico, which are not subject to tariffs or quotas, but tariffs could be re-imposed on surging product groups after consultations; and (4) imports from Australia, which are not subject to tariffs, quotas, or an anti-surge mechanism. 
The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) is managing a process in which U.S. companies may request and/or oppose temporary product exclusions from the Section 232 tariffs and quotas. Over 312,000 exclusions have been requested for steel products. U. S. Steel opposes exclusion requests for imported products that are the same as, or substitutes for, products manufactured by U. S. Steel.
Multiple legal challenges to the Section 232 action continue before the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC), and the Supreme Court of the United States. U.S. courts have consistently rejected constitutional and statutory challenges to the initial Section 232 action and overall product exclusion process. Multiple countries have challenged the Section 232 action at the World Trade Organization (WTO), imposed retaliatory tariffs, and/or acted to safeguard their domestic steel industries from increased steel imports. In turn, the United States has challenged the retaliation at the WTO.
In October 2021, the United States and EU announced agreements to replace the Section 232 tariffs with a TRQ, extend certain EU product exclusions, eliminate the EU’s Section 232 retaliation on U.S. imports, suspend WTO disputes related to the Section 232 action, and commit to negotiate a global arrangement on steel overcapacity and carbon intensity within two years. Effective January 1, 2022, the TRQ allows certain quantities of products made from steel melted and poured in the EU to enter the United States Section 232 tariff-free, with quantities that exceed the quota still subject to 25 percent tariffs. In December 2021, the United States began consultations with Japan regarding the Section 232 action and global overcapacity.
Since its implementation in March 2018, the Section 232 action has supported the U.S. steel industry’s and U. S. Steel’s investments in advanced steel production capabilities, technology, and skills, thereby strengthening U.S. national and economic security. The Company continues to actively defend the Section 232 action.
In February 2019, the European Commission (EC) implemented a definitive safeguard on global steel imports in the form of TRQs. The TRQs, which impose 25 percent tariffs on steel imports that exceed the TRQ limit, are currently effective through June 2024. In December 2021, the EC initiated its third periodic review of this safeguard, which will consider the impact of the agreement to replace U.S. Section 232 tariffs with a TRQ for certain EU steel products and may result in adjustments to the safeguard TRQ limits.
Antidumping duties (AD) and countervailing duties (CVD or antisubsidy duties) apply in addition to the Section 232 tariffs and quotas and the EC’s safeguard, and AD/CVD orders will continue beyond the Section 232 action and the EC’s safeguard. Thus, U. S. Steel continues to actively defend and maintain the 60 U.S. AD/CVD orders and 12 EU AD/CVD orders covering U. S. Steel products in multiple proceedings before the DOC, U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), CIT, CAFC, the EC and European courts, and the WTO.
Between April and August 2021, the United States imposed six new AD/CVD orders on imports of seamless pipe from Czechia, Korea, Russia, and Ukraine, setting duties ranging from 6 to 258 percent. This year, DOC also made two final affirmative AD/CVD circumvention determinations, concluding: (1) that corrosion-resistant steel (CORE) from Malaysia made from Chinese and Taiwanese substrate circumvents AD/CVD orders on CORE from China and Taiwan and (2) that oil country tubular goods (OCTG) from Brunei and the Philippines made from Chinese hot-rolled steel (HRS) circumvent the existing AD/CVD orders on OCTG from China. In October 2021, DOC initiated new AD/CVD investigations on imports of OCTG from Argentina, Mexico, Korea, and Russia that are expected to conclude in the second half of 2022. The ITC is conducting five-year "sunset" reviews of AD/CVD orders on HRS, cold-rolled steel (CRS), and CORE from twelve countries, with decisions expected in the second half of 2022.
In Europe, the EC imposed an AD order on EU imports of HRS from Turkey, effective July 2021. The EC also initiated AD investigations of EU imports of hot-dipped galvanized steel from Turkey and Russia in June 2021, with final determinations expected in the third quarter of 2022. The EC is currently conducting five year “expiry” (sunset) reviews of AD/CVD orders on CRS from China and Russia, which are expected to conclude in the second half of 2022.
Additional tariffs of 7.5 to 25 percent continue to apply to certain U.S. imports from China, including certain raw materials used in steel production, semi-finished and finished steel products, and downstream steel products, pursuant to Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.
The Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Steel Committee, and trilateral negotiations between the United States, EU and Japan continue to address steel overcapacity.
U. S. Steel will continue to execute a broad, global strategy to maximize opportunities and navigate challenges presented by imports, global steel overcapacity, and international trade law and policy developments.
Environmental Stewardship
U. S. Steel is committed to effective environmental stewardship. We have implemented and continue to develop business practices that are designed to reduce negative environmental impacts. We believe part of being a good corporate citizen requires a dedicated focus on how our industry affects the environment. U. S. Steel's environmental expenditures totaled $302 million in 2021, $278 million in 2020 and $376 million in 2019. Overall, environmental compliance expenditures represent approximately 2 percent of U. S. Steel’s total costs and expenses in 2021, 2020 and 2019. For further information, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Environmental Matters.” We have taken the actions described below in furtherance of that goal. 
We continue to work on the promotion of cost-effective environmental strategies by supporting the development of appropriate air, water and waste laws and regulations at the local, state, national and international levels. We are committed to reducing our emissions and are investigating, creating and implementing innovative, best practice solutions throughout our operations to improve our environmental performance and to manage and reduce energy consumption.
U. S. Steel recycled 5.3 million tons and 3.0 million tons of purchased and produced steel scrap in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Because of steel’s physical properties, our products can be recycled at the end of their useful life without loss of quality, contributing to steel’s high recycling rate and affordability.
Many of our major production facilities have Environmental Management Systems that are certified to the ISO 14001 Standard. This standard, published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), provides the framework for the measurement and improvement of environmental impacts of the certified facility.
In 2019, and in each succeeding year since, we published the Clairton Operating and Environmental Report related to our Clairton Plant of Mon Valley Works. While U. S. Steel agreed to publish an annual report as part of the 2019 Allegheny County Health Department Settlement Order and Agreement, we took the opportunity to enhance the report by including detailed descriptions of our operations, our safety and environmental performance and community involvement in order to provide easily accessible information for the public. The Report details battery combustion stack and fugitive emission performance at Clairton and Clairton's continued commitment to environmental stewardship. In 2021, we published a similar report for the Edgar Thomson facility.
By using the blast furnace and coke oven gas generated in our cokemaking and steelmaking activities to power our facilities, we avoided consuming natural gas and other fuels from 2019 through 2021 equivalent to the amount it would take to heat more than 3.2 million households each year. In 2021, we recycled approximately 2.2 million tons of blast furnace slag, 85 thousand tons of Basic Oxygen Process steel slag, and 16 thousand tons of electric arc furnace slag by selling it for use as aggregate and in highway construction.
Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
In 2019, the Company announced its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity across its global footprint by 20 percent, as measured by the rate of CO2 equivalents emitted per ton of finished steel shipped, by 2030 based on 2018 baseline 
levels. Then, in 2021, the Company announced its goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, as measured by the rate of CO2 equivalents emitted per ton of finished steel shipped. The Company has provided information on paths to achieve this goal on its website. These targets will apply to U. S. Steel’s global operations.
U. S. Steel plans to achieve its greenhouse gas emissions intensity reduction goals through the execution of multiple initiatives. These include the use of EAF steelmaking technology at U. S. Steel’s Fairfield Works and at Big River Steel, the first LEED-certified steel mill in the nation. EAF steelmaking relies on scrap recycling to produce new steel products, leveraging the ability to continuously recycle steel. Further carbon intensity reductions are expected to come from the implementation of ongoing energy efficiency measures, continued use of renewable energy sources and other process improvements to be developed.
The carbon intensity reduction targets reflect our continued commitment to improvement in production efficiency and the manufacture of products that are environmentally friendly. In addition to a commitment to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions intensity, U. S. Steel is committed to helping its customers achieve their environmental goals. Our industry-leading XG3™ advanced high-strength steel enables automakers to manufacture lighter weight vehicles that meet federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards with reduced carbon emissions. As part of our innovation efforts, we continue to look at new steelmaking technologies so that we can produce green steels and further reduce carbon emissions.
Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies
Some of U. S. Steel’s facilities were in operation before 1900. Although the Company believes that its environmental practices have either led the industry or at least been consistent with prevailing industry practices, hazardous materials have been and may continue to be released at current or former operating sites or delivered to sites operated by third parties.
Our U.S. facilities are subject to environmental laws applicable in the U.S., including the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as well as state and local laws and regulations.
U. S. Steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating, and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations, related to release of hazardous materials, which in recent years have been mainly for process changes to meet CAA obligations and similar obligations in Europe.
EU Environmental Requirements and Slovak Operations
Phase IV of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) commenced on January 1, 2021 and will finish on December 31, 2030. The EU ETS is a component of the European Union's policy to combat climate change and is the world's largest carbon market. The EU ETS operates on a cap and trade principle, and our operations in USSE are required to participate. The European Commission issued final approval of the Slovak National Allocation table in July 2021. The Slovak Ministry of Environment, after consent from the European Commission, allocated free allowances to USSE in December 2021. The final volume was reduced to reflect USSE production cuts in 2019 and 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020 USSE started purchasing EUA for the Phase IV period. As of December 31, 2021, we have purchased approximately 4 million EUA totaling €176 million (approximately $199 million) to fully cover the estimated 2021 shortfall and 1.1 million EUA totaling €68 million (approximately $77 million) to cover the expected 2022 shortfall of emission allowances.
The EU's Industrial Emissions Directive requires implementation of EU determined best available techniques (BAT) for Iron and Steel production to reduce environmental impacts as well as compliance with BAT associated emission levels. Total capital expenditures for projects to comply with or go beyond BAT requirements were €138 million (approximately $156 million) over the actual program period. These costs were partially offset by the EU funding received and may be mitigated over the next measurement periods if USSK complies with certain financial covenants, which are assessed annually. USSK complied with these covenants as of December 31, 2021. If we are unable to meet these covenants in the future, USSK might be required to provide additional collateral (e.g., bank guarantee) to secure 50 percent of the EU funding received. 
For further discussion of laws applicable in Slovakia and the EU and their impact on USSE, see Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Contingencies and Commitments, Environmental Matters, EU Environmental Requirements.”
New and Emerging Environmental Regulations
United States and European Greenhouse Gas Emissions Regulations
Future compliance with CO2 emission requirements may include substantial costs for emission allowances, restriction of production and higher prices for coking coal, natural gas and electricity generated by carbon-based systems. Because we cannot predict what requirements ultimately will be imposed in the U.S. and Europe, it is difficult to estimate the likely impact on U. S. Steel, but it could be substantial. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed Executive Order 13783 instructing the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) to review the Clean Power Plan (CPP). As a result, in June 2019, the U.S. EPA published a final rule, the “Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule” that replaced the CPP. Twenty-three states, the District of Columbia, and seven municipalities are challenging the CPP repeal and ACE rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. A coalition of 21 states has intervened in the litigation in support of the U.S. EPA. Various other public interest organizations, industry groups, and Members of Congress are also participating in the litigation. On January 19, 2021, the District 
of Columbia Circuit vacated and remanded the ACE to the U.S. EPA, while the CPP remains stayed. It is unclear as to how the Biden administration will proceed with the remand. Any impacts to our operations as a result of any future greenhouse gas regulations are not estimable at this time since the matter is unsettled. In any case, to the extent expenditures associated with any greenhouse gas regulation, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of U. S. Steel's products and services, operating results will be reduced.
The Phase IV EU ETS period spans 2021-2030 and began on January 1, 2021. The Phase IV period is divided into two sub periods (2021-2025 and 2026-2030), rules for the first subperiod are finalized, however we expect that rules for the second subperiod may be more stringent than those for the first subperiod. Currently, the overall EU target is a 40 percent reduction of 1990 emissions by 2030. Free allocation of CO2 allowances for the first subperiod is based on reduced benchmark values which were published in the first quarter of 2021 and historical levels of production from 2014-2018. Allocations to individual installations may be adjusted annually to reflect relevant increases and decreases in production. The threshold for adjustments is set at 15 percent and will be assessed on the basis of a rolling average of two precedent years. Production data verified by an external auditor in March 2021 shows that USSE missed the 15 percent threshold in 2019-20; therefore, the free allocation for 2021 was decreased accordingly. Additionally, lower production in 2019 and 2020 will have an impact on the future free allocation for 2026-2030, where the updated historical production average for years 2019-2023 will be assessed. Once approved, the rules may impact subperiod 2026-2030.

In order to achieve the EU political goal of carbon emissions neutrality by 2050, on July 14, 2021, the European Commission released a package of legislative proposals called Fit for 55. The proposals contain significant changes to current EU ETS functions and requirements, including: a new carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) to impose carbon fees on EU imports, further reduction of free CO2 allowance allocation to heavy industry and measures to strengthen the supply of carbon allowances. The proposals are subject to the EU legislative process and we cannot predict their future impact at this time.
United States - Air
The CAA imposes stringent limits on air emissions with a federally mandated operating permit program and civil and criminal enforcement sanctions. The CAA requires, among other things, the regulation of hazardous air pollutants through the development and promulgation of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) and Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Standards. The U.S. EPA has developed various industry-specific MACT standards pursuant to this requirement. The CAA requires the U.S. EPA to promulgate regulations establishing emission standards for each category of Hazardous Air Pollutants. The U.S. EPA also must conduct risk assessments on each source category that is already subject to MACT standards and determine if additional standards are needed to reduce residual risks.
While our operations are subject to several different categories of NESHAP and MACT standards, the principal impact of these standards on U. S. Steel's operations includes those that are specific to coke making, iron making, steel making and iron ore processing.
On July 13, 2020, the U.S. EPA published a Residual Risk and Technology Review (RTR) rule for the Integrated Iron and Steel MACT category in the Federal Register. Based on the results of the U.S. EPA’s risk review, the agency determined that risks due to emissions of air toxics from the Integrated Iron and Steel category are acceptable and that the current regulations provided an ample margin of safety to protect public health. Under the technology review, the U.S. EPA determined that there are no developments in practices, processes or control technologies that necessitate revision of the standards. In September 2020, several petitions for review of the rule, including those filed by the Company, the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), Clean Air Council and others, were filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The cases were consolidated and are being held in abeyance while the U.S. EPA reviews and responds to administrative petitions for review. For the Taconite Iron Ore Processing category, based on the results of the U.S. EPA's risk review, the agency promulgated a final rule on July 28, 2020, in which the U.S. EPA determined that risks from emissions of air toxics from this source category are acceptable and that the existing standards provide an ample margin of safety. Furthermore, under the technology review, the agency identified no cost-effective developments in controls, practices, or processes to achieve further emissions reductions. Based upon our analysis of the proposed taconite rule, the Company does not expect any material impact as a result of the rule. However, petitions for review of the rule were filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in which the Company and AISI intervened. Because the U.S. EPA has not completed its review of the Coke MACT regulations, any impacts related to the U.S. EPA’s review of the coke standards cannot be estimated at this time.
On March 12, 2018, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), along with other petitioners, submitted a CAA Section 126(b) petition to the U.S. EPA. In the petition, the DEC asserts that stationary sources from the following nine states are interfering with attainment or maintenance of the 2008 and 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in New York: Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. DEC is requesting the U.S. EPA to require sources of nitrogen oxides in the nine states to reduce such emissions. In a final rule published in the October 18, 2019 Federal Register, the U.S. EPA denied the petition. On October 29, 2019, New York, New Jersey, and the City of New York petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of the U.S. EPA’s denial of the petition. In July 2020, the Court vacated the U.S. EPA’s determination and remanded it back to the U.S. EPA to reconsider the 126(b) petition in a manner consistent with the Court’s opinion. At this time, since the U.S. EPA’s decision after its reconsideration is unknown, the impacts of any reconsideration are indeterminable and inestimable.

The CAA also requires the U.S. EPA to develop and implement NAAQS for criteria pollutants, which include, among others, particulate matter (PM) - consisting of PM10 and PM2.5, lead, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone.
In October 2015, the U.S. EPA lowered the NAAQS for ozone from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb. On November 6, 2017, the U.S. EPA designated most areas in which we operate as attainment with the 2015 standard. In a separate ruling, on June 4, 2018, the U.S. EPA designated other areas in which we operate as “marginal nonattainment” with the 2015 ozone standard. On December 6, 2018, the U.S. EPA published a final rule regarding implementation of the 2015 ozone standard. Because no state regulatory or permitting actions to bring the ozone nonattainment areas into attainment have yet to be proposed or developed for U. S. Steel facilities, the operational and financial impact of the ozone NAAQS cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. On December 31, 2020, the U.S. EPA published a final rule pursuant to its statutorily required review of NAAQS that retains the ozone NAAQS at 70 ppb. In January 2021, New York, along with several states and non-governmental organizations filed petitions for judicial review of the action with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Several other states and industry trade groups intervened in support of the U. S. EPA’s action. The case remains before the Court.
On December 14, 2012, the U.S. EPA lowered the annual standard for PM2.5 from 15 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3) to 12 ug/m3, and retained the PM2.5 24-hour and PM10 NAAQS rules. In December 2014, the U.S. EPA designated some areas in which U. S. Steel operates as nonattainment with the 2012 annual PM2.5 standard. On April 6, 2018, the U.S. EPA published a notice that Pennsylvania, California and Idaho failed to submit a State Implementation Plan (SIP) to demonstrate attainment with the 2012 fine particulate standard by the deadline established by the CAA. As a result of the notice, Pennsylvania, a state in which we operate, was required to submit a SIP to the U.S. EPA no later than November 7, 2019 to avoid sanctions. On April 29, 2019, the ACHD published a draft SIP for the Allegheny County nonattainment area which demonstrates that all of Allegheny County will meet its reasonable further progress requirements and be in attainment with the 2012 PM2.5 annual and 24-hour NAAQS by December 31, 2021 with the existing controls that are in place. On September 12, 2019, the Allegheny County Board of Health unanimously approved the draft SIP. The draft SIP was then sent to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP). PADEP submitted the SIP to the U.S. EPA for approval on November 1, 2019. To date, the U.S. EPA has not taken action on PADEP’s submittal. On December 18, 2020, the U.S. EPA published a final rule pursuant to its statutorily required review of NAAQS that retains the existing PM2.5 standards without revision. In early 2021, several states and non-governmental organizations filed petitions for judicial review of the action with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Several industry trade groups intervened in support of the U.S. EPA’s action. The case remains before the Court.
On January 26, 2021, ACHD announced that for the first time in history all eight air quality monitors in Allegheny County met the federal air quality standards including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10).
