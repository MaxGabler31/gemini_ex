Item 1. Business.
1.a.) General Development of Business
 
Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. 
 
Chineseinvestors.com was incorporated on January 6, 1997 in the State of Indiana under the corporate name “MAS Acquisition LII Corp.” Prior to June 12, 2000, the Company was a ‘blank check’ company seeking a business combination with an unidentified business. On June 12, 2000, we acquired 8,200,000 shares of common stock, representing 100% of the outstanding shares of Chineseinvestors.com, Inc., which was incorporated in the State of California on June 15, 1999. In connection with this acquisition, Aaron Tsai, the former sole officer and director, was replaced by Chineseinvestors.com, Inc.’s officers and directors. The stockholders of Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. were issued 8,200,000 shares of its common stock, or approximately 96% of the total outstanding common shares. After giving effect to the acquisition, Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary and its name was changed to Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. Immediately prior to the acquisition of Chineseinvestors.com, Inc., MAS Capital Inc. returned 8,200,000 shares of common stock for cancellation without any consideration.
 
Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. was established as an ‘in language’ (Chinese) financial information web portal that provides information about US Equity and Financial Markets, as well as other financial markets. Over the years, various informational components have been added to the Company’s web portal and the general content has been improved as the Company continues to derive a material portion of its income from various subscription services it offers to its customers. The Company’s subscription services provide education about investing, news, and analysis on the US Equity Markets as well as news about particular stocks that the Company follows. Nevertheless, the Company does not provide its subscribers with individualized investment advice and it never has investment discretion over any subscribers’ or site visitors’ funds.
 
In addition, the Company provides investor relations services for other companies, especially those requiring Mandarin language support, which now accounts for one of the Company’s most significant revenue sources. In that regard, the Company translates client releases into English from Mandarin or vice versa , features client advertisements on the www.chinesefn.com website, and otherwise assists clients in achieving their particular goals, which may include, increasing the client’s stock price, increasing general awareness about the client and their stock, and/or moving from pink sheets to an established public securities market. All of those goals are not shared by every client. However, promotions geared to the Chinese American market are the underlying common thread, generally in the form of advertisements on the chinesefn.com website.
 
In exchange for the services it provides, the Company generally receives a fee consisting of cash, client securities or a mix of cash and equity. Equity compensation provides success incentives, aligning the interests of the Company and its clients.

Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. All of Newcoins Grenadine’s registered shares, 1000 shares, were issued to ChineseInvestors.com, Inc.’s CEO, Wei Wang. Wei Wang holds these shares as agent for ChneseInvestors.com, Inc. Newcoins Grenadine’s total authorized capital is $1,000,000.
 
Newcoins Grenadine was established to develop a full-service retail Forex and CFD platform that connects with one of the market’s leading trading platforms to provide customers with Forex/CFD market trading service, as well as offering education, market information, and insights for customers related to the Forex/CFD market. The platform has 992 subscribers in the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Russia, Hong Kong, Brunei and India It does not have registered users in the US.

In that regard on or about February 27, 2019 Newcoins Grenadine entered into a Technology Solution Agreement with Match-Trade Technologies (“MTT”), pursuant to which MTT agreed to provide Newcoins Grenadine with a trading infrastructure (integrated electronic systems and software) designed to offer a platform to Newcoins Grenadine’s clients for the trading of financial products, i.e., Forex and/or CFDs and/or other financial instruments offered to Newcoins Grenadine’s clients. In or about March 2019, Newcoins Grenadine entered into an agreement with Forexstreet S.L. (“FS”) pursuant to which FS agreed to provide daily news feeds and updates. Newcoins Grenadine platform has not generated any revenues to date. Given the platform’s target audience is outside of the US and China, it has been challenging to convert leads generated as a result of advertising and marketing efforts into account deposits that will lead to trading due to the significant language barrier. The Company has determined that the expense that would be required to hire and trains native speakers to assist the platform’s potential account holders/traders would outweigh the potential gain and has decided to focus its efforts on the Company’s core, traditional business lines. In an effort to reduce fixed costs associated with the platform, the Company is in the process of cancelling these service agreements and is considering discontinuing the platform.

Market and Market Prospects
 
A significant market focus of the Company is the segment of the Chinese population (in both the US and abroad) that does not have English language reading and or speaking skills, but who wishes to participate in the various financial markets that typically do not offer real time Chinese language information from an investment and/or general information perspective. With the emergence of a Chinese middle class, as well as those who have inherited wealth, there appears to be a continuing growing interest by the Chinese public in the general financial and securities marketplace as a whole.
 
In addition, the Company continues to provide various additional service initiatives to businesses including consulting services and various investor and public relations services. Meanwhile, the Company continues to build its current client base with regard to its content-based consumer services and its business to business services.

The Company has worked toward establishing its web presence, but due to the lack of site use information for competitor companies, and based upon the Company’s website access metrics, the Company must acknowledge that, while it has a substantial public audience potential, it is difficult to ascertain exactly where any specific leadership position lies; therefore, the Company can make no definitive statement as to an overall position of its website and its presence within its specific marketplace.

GENERAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING A CRYPTOCURRENCY BUSINESS
 
The Company may rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from or software licensed from third parties to facilitate the Company’s cryptocurrency related businesses including its planned domestic cryptocurrency ATM Network. 
 
Any damage to, or failure of these third-party systems generally could result in interruptions in the Company’s services. Such interruptions may cause end-users to terminate use of the Company’s services. The Company will be harmed if others believe its services are unreliable.
 
Hardware, software, data and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
 
Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase the Company’s expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of its services until equivalent technology is either developed or, if available, is identified and obtained through purchase or license and thereafter integrated into the Company’s services. If the Company were to experience significant strains on its data capacity, customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may harm its business.
 
Industry-specific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving, and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm the Company’s cryptocurrency related business endeavors.
 
Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding services such as those to be provided by the Company. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit the Company’s customers’ use and adoption of the Company’s products and services. Compliance with these regulations may also require it to devote greater resources to support certain adopters and end-users that the Company may not have or the ability to acquire.
 
Further, in some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to the Company if it is deemed to be a regulated securities business in the United States such as a broker-dealer or investment adviser under state and federal law. The interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations, and rulings is evolving in the courts and among regulators, and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and results. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business.
 
If the Company is unable to scale its operations and increase productivity, the Company may not be able to successfully implement its business plan.
 
The Company’s success will depend in part upon the ability of the Company’s senior management to manage its projected growth of the cryptocurrency division. To do so, the Company must continue to increase the productivity of its existing employees hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of the Company’s operations and personnel, it will need to continue to improve operational, financial and management controls, its reporting systems and procedures, and compliance with the laws and regulations in which it transacts business. If the Company fails to successfully scale its operations and increase productivity, the Company may be unable to execute its business plan.

The Company’s operating results are likely to fluctuate.
 
Important factors that may cause the Company’s revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate include: the Company’s ability to retain and increase users of its products and services and satisfy their requirements; the Company’s ability to retain and increase users of the products services and satisfy their requirements; the Company’s ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisitions or investments; general economic conditions, which may adversely affect usage rates; variations in the revenue mix of the Company’s services and respective growth rates; general economic conditions, which may adversely affect usage rates; changes in terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or because of competition; changes in payment methods, terms and the timing of such payments, including the use or obsolescence of digital currency media; changes in foreign currency or cryptocurrency exchange rates; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of the Company’s business; expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; income tax effects, including the impact of changes in USA federal and state and international tax laws applicable to the Company’s business and use of blockchain-related media for payment; technical difficulties or interruptions in the Company’s services; and regulatory compliance costs. Many of these factors are outside of the Company’s control.
 
The Company may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights.
 
The Internet and financial services industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. While the Company has not been the subject of such actions, we may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. The Company’s technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third-party or it may be required to pay damages, or both. The outcome of any such claims or litigation should they occur, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing the Company’s business plan, result in efforts to enjoin the Company’s activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require the Company to change its technology, change the Company’s business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements.
 
Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent the Company that from offering its services to others could adversely affect the Company
 
Any failure in the Company’s delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect its relationships with customers and financial results.
 
Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that the Company does not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect the Company’s reputation and its business.
 
The Services may not be widely adopted and may have limited users.
 
As noted herein, to date, the Company’s cryptocurrency products and services have not been adopted by a large number of individuals/subscribers, companies or other entities. As there has been a limited public interest in the creation and development of such products and services, possibly related to the 2018 Cryptocurrency Crash, the Company has ceased offering a majority of its cryptocurrency news and education products. Limited cryptocurrency education products are being bundled with the Company’s traditional products so that subscribers who wish to continue to follow the cryptocurrency market will have access to some basic cryptocurrency news and education. Currently, the Company does not have short-term plans to resume these programs in their original form and has reduced the resources allocated to these projects.

Moreover the Company is not currently developing any new products or services relative to this division.
 
Meanwhile as the Company’s cryptocurrency mining business did not generate the revenues expected the corresponding service agreements were terminated and/or allowed to expire and the Company ceased its mining operations. All mined currency was transferred to the Company. The Company is arranging for the return of its mining equipment that was housed with SM. The Company continues to host a Bitcoin ATM at its San Gabriel, California office, however, plans to launch its own Bitcoin ATM network in California have been put on hold indefinitely.
 
Alternative networks may be established that compete with or are more widely used than the Company’s.
 
It is possible that alternative products and service offerings could be established to facilitate services that are materially similar to those offered by the Company’s cryptocurrency division. The Company may be unable to compete with these alternative service providers.
 
The regulatory regime governing the blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, tokens and token offerings is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Company’s cryptocurrency related businesses.
 
Regulation of blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, tokens and token offerings tokens is likely to rapidly evolve, varies significantly among international, federal, state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States and in other countries may in the future, adopt laws, regulations, guidance, or other actions, which may severely impact the development and growth of the Company’s cryptocurrency related businesses. Failure by the Company or certain users of its services to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines, all of which may affect the operations of the Company’s cryptocurrency related businesses.
 
As blockchain networks and blockchain assets have grown in popularity and in market size, federal and state agencies in the United States have begun to take interest in, and in some cases regulate, their use and operation.
 
The regulatory responses to emerging technologies, and to blockchain in particular in the US vary. The U.S. federal government has not exercised its constitutional preemptive power to regulate blockchain to the exclusion of states or even expressed intention to do so, regardless of the interest of federal agencies and so the states remain free to introduce their own rules and regulations. As an example, in 2015 New York became the first state in the U.S. to regulate virtual currency companies through state agency rulemaking. Initially, the Company intends to offer certain products and services in California, including a network of cryptocurrency ATMs, with plans to expand to other states. To date, California has failed at its attempts at creating a license, through a “Digital Currency Business Enrollment Program,” to conduct business related to “digital currency” within the state. Other states, such as Texas, have published guidance on how their existing regulatory regimes apply to virtual currencies. Some states, like New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Washington, have amended their statutes and regulations to include virtual currencies into existing securities regulation regimes. As such, there can be no assurances that the current regulatory framework, will continue in effect in states where the Company may conduct business for as long as the Company exists, or that other states will adopt or implement favorable regulation or legislation that may facilitate the utilization of the Company’s cryptocurrency products/services in the United States. Treatment of virtual currencies continues to evolve under the federal law of the United States as well. The United States Department of the Treasury, the United States Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), for example, have published guidance on the treatment of virtual currencies, tokens an instrument similar to tokens. Self-regulatory organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and the National Futures Association (“NFA”) have also issued such guidance. The United States Internal Revenue Service has released guidance treating virtual currency as property that is not currency for United States federal income tax purposes, although there is no indication yet whether other United States courts or federal or state regulators will follow this classification. Both United States federal and state agencies in the United States have instituted enforcement actions against those violating their interpretation of existing laws. The Company may not be able to implement or provide access to some of its cryptocurrency products and services, for example, its planned cryptocurrency ATM Network, in certain areas in the United States, if at all, due to changes in such laws and regulations. Further, the regulation of non-currency use of blockchain assets is also uncertain. The CFTC has publicly taken the position that certain blockchain assets are commodities, and the SEC has issued a public report stating United States federal securities laws require treating some blockchain assets as securities. To the extent that a domestic government or quasi-governmental agency in the United States exerts regulatory authority over a blockchain network or asset, the Company may be materially and adversely affected.

Blockchain networks also face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union, China and Russia. 
 
Various foreign jurisdictions may in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the Company. Such laws, regulations or directives may conflict with those of the United States and other countries and may directly and negatively impact the Company’s business. The effect of any future regulatory changes is impossible to predict, but such changes could be substantial and materially adverse to the development and growth of the Company.
 
If the Company is unable to satisfy data protection, security, privacy, and other government and industry specific requirements, its growth may be impaired.
 
To the extent not previously discussed, there are several data protection, security, privacy and other government- and industry-specific requirements, including those that require companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. Security compromises could harm the Company’s reputation, erode user confidence in the effectiveness of its security measures, negatively impact its ability to attract new users, or cause existing users to stop using the Company’s products and services.
 
The further development and acceptance of blockchain networks which are a part of a new and rapidly changing industry are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate.
 
The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of blockchain networks and blockchain assets would have an adverse material effect on the successful development of the Company’s cryptocurrency division. 
 
The growth of the blockchain industry in general, and its volatility. 
 
The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile as evidenced by the 2018 cryptocurrency crash. Fluctuations in the price of digital assets have materially and adversely affected our business. The prices of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have historically been subject to dramatic fluctuations and are highly volatile. Several factors have likely influenced the market demand for the Company’s cryptocurrency products and services including, but not limited to: Global blockchain asset supply; Global blockchain asset demand, which can be influenced by the growth of retail merchants' and commercial businesses' acceptance of blockchain assets like cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services, the security of online blockchain asset exchanges and digital wallets that hold blockchain assets, the perception that the use and holding of blockchain assets is safe and secure, and the regulatory restrictions on their use; Currency exchange rates, including the rates at which digital assets may be exchanged for fiat currencies; Fiat currency withdrawal and deposit policies of blockchain asset exchanges and liquidity on such exchanges; Interruptions in service from or failures of major blockchain asset exchanges; Monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations; Regulatory measures, if any, that affect the use of blockchain assets; Global or regional political, or economic or financial events and situations. A decrease in the price of a single blockchain asset may cause volatility in the entire blockchain asset industry and may affect other blockchain assets. For example, a security breach that affects investor or user confidence in Bitcoin may affect the industry as a whole and may also cause the price of other blockchain assets to fluctuate.

Market Overview
 
Domestic Markets
 
According to New Frontier Data, the U.S. Hemp CBD Market is expected to triple by 2022. Likewise, according to Hemp Industry Daily market projections, the national market for hemp-derived CBD is expected to balloon to $7 billion by 2023. The Hemp Industry Daily report indicates that "with the removal of hemp from federal prohibition under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA), the total U.S. hemp industry now looks to expand at a healthy 18.4% through a 5-year combined annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2018-2022.” It is anticipated that removing hemp from the CSA will have immediate impacts, i.e. banking and credit card processing for hemp-derived CBD accounts, both online and in mass-market retailers, and giving confidence to mass-market retailers that may have been hesitant to carry hemp-CBD brands. See https://newfrontierdata.com/marijuana-insights/u-s-hemp-cbd-market-to-triple-by-2022. As a first mover in the industry, particularly as it relates to the domestic Chinese community, CHO seeks to capitalize on recent market developments and consumer confidence through education and targeted marketing.

International Market
 
Currently, ChineseHempOil.com, Inc. does not have plans to market its opt product line internationally; however, this could change as international markets show an interest in such products.
 
Market Opportunity
 
CHO intends to leverage its first to market advantage of promoting industrial hemp products to the domestic Chinese community. CHO seeks to capitalize on recent legal, market developments and projections and growing consumer confidence through education and targeted marketing. 
Competition
 
At present, industrial hemp health products are widely available in the United States. That said, the Company’s main goal is to distinguish itself from the competitors through targeted marketing in the domestic Chinese community and enhanced product delivery technology.
Government Regulation
 
The Agricultural Improvement Act was Signed into Law on December 20, 2018 Removing Hemp from the Controlled Substances Act. 
 
On December 14, 2016, the Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) made an update to the Federal Register item (21 CFR Part 1308), creating a new Administration Controlled Substances Code Number for Marihuana Extract (hereinafter, the “Marijuana Extract Rule”). Marijuana Extract is defined therein as “. . . an extract containing one or more cannabinoids that has been derived from any plant of the genus Cannabis, other than the separated resin (whether crude or purified) obtained from the plant.” The Marijuana Extract Rule confirms that as of January 17, 2017, a harsher cannabis law will be put into place reclassifying non-THC cannabis oil as a schedule 1 drug, despite the fact cannabidiol (“CBD”) extracts are non-psychoactive.
 
Approximately two years later, in December 2018, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 was signed into law. Among other things, this new law changes certain federal authorities relating to the production and marketing of hemp, defined as cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.), and derivatives of cannabis with extremely low (less than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis) concentrations of the psychoactive compound delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). These changes include removing hemp from the Controlled Substances Act. That said, Congress explicitly preserved the FDA’s current authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, which allows the FDA to continue enforcing the law to protect patients and the public while also providing potential regulatory pathways for products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds. In short, products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds are treated like any other FDA-regulated products — meaning they’re subject to the same authorities and requirements as FDA-regulated products containing any other substance. This is true regardless of the source of the substance, including whether the substance is derived from a plant that is classified as hemp under the Agriculture Improvement Act.
 
While products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds remain subject to the FDA’s authorities and requirements, there are pathways available to lawfully introduce these products into interstate commerce. These pathways include ways for companies to seek approval from the FDA to market with therapeutic claims a human or animal drug that is derived from cannabis.

In addition, the agency has issued notices related to hulled hemp seeds, hemp seed protein and hemp seed oil indicating that these products can be legally marketed in human foods for these uses without food additive approval, assuming compliance with all other requirements and restriction.
 
Our business is subject to strict government regulations.
 
The processing, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of our products are subject to federal laws and regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. These activities are also regulated by various state, local, and international laws and agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. Government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of our products, which could result in lost revenues and increased costs to us. For instance, the FDA regulates, among other things, the composition, safety, labeling, and marketing of dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary ingredients for human use). The FDA may not accept the evidence of safety for any new dietary ingredient that we may wish to market, may determine that a particular dietary supplement or ingredient presents an unacceptable health risk, and may determine that a particular claim or statement of nutritional value that we use to support the marketing of a dietary supplement is an impermissible drug claim, is not substantiated, or is an unauthorized version of a “health claim.”
 
Any of these actions could prevent us from marketing particular dietary supplement products or making certain claims or statements of nutritional support for them. The FDA could also require us to remove a particular product from the market. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to us, including lost revenues from any additional products that we are required to remove from the market, any of which could be material. Any product recalls or removals could also lead to liability, substantial costs, and reduced growth prospects. With respect to FTC matters, if the FTC has reason to believe the law is being violated (e.g. failure to possess adequate substantiation for product claims), it can initiate an enforcement action. The FTC has a variety of processes and remedies available to it for enforcement, both administratively and judicially, including compulsory process authority, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement could result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, consumer redress, and divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, or such other relief as may be deemed necessary. Violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Any action against us by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products. 
 
Additional or more stringent regulations of dietary supplements and other products have been considered from time to time. These developments could require reformulation of some products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of some products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of some products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, adverse event reporting, or other new requirements. Any of these developments could increase our costs significantly. For example, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act (S.3546), which was passed by Congress in December 2006, imposes significant regulatory requirements on dietary supplements including reporting of “serious adverse events” to FDA and recordkeeping requirements. This legislation could raise our costs and negatively impact our business. In June 2007, the FDA adopted final regulations on GMPs in manufacturing, packaging, or holding dietary ingredients and dietary supplements, which apply to the products we may manufacture and sell. These regulations require dietary supplements to be prepared, packaged, and held in compliance with certain rules. These regulations could raise our costs and negatively impact our business. Additionally, our third-party suppliers or vendors may not be able to comply with these rules without incurring substantial expenses. If our third-party suppliers or vendors are not able to timely comply with these new rules, we may experience increased cost or delays in obtaining certain raw materials and third-party products. Also, the FDA has announced that it plans to publish guidance governing the notification of new dietary ingredients. Although FDA guidance is not mandatory, it is a strong indication of the FDA’s current views on the topic discussed in the guidance, including its position on enforcement.

Marijuana businesses may still not be able to secure bank accounts. 
 
Though more banks are providing services to marijuana businesses, most banks and financial institutions will not because they worry about criminal liability under the federal Controlled Substances Act and under the Bank Secrecy Act for money laundering. Even after the passage of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, industrial hemp businesses may still find it difficult to establish banking relationships. Though FinCEN issued guidelines in 2014 that allow financial institutions to provide bank accounts to marijuana businesses, few banks have taken advantage of those guidelines and many marijuana businesses still operate on an all-cash basis. This makes it tough for cannabis businesses to manage their businesses, pay their employees and taxes, and having so much cash on hand also creates significant public safety issues. Many ancillary businesses that service cannabis businesses have to deal with the unpredictability of their clients or customers not having a bank account.
 
IRC 280E
 
Internal Revenue Code section 280E continues to prohibit marijuana businesses from deducting their ordinary and necessary business expenses, other than costs of goods sold, forcing marijuana businesses to contend with higher effective federal tax rates than similar companies in other industries. The effective tax rate on a marijuana business depends on how large its ratio of nondeductible expenses is to its total revenues, but it can be as high as 90%, affecting the future profitability of a marijuana business or even ancillary business. The Company sells a number of industrial hemp/CBD products but does not market or sell marijuana therefore the restrictions imposed by Section 280E should not be applicable to the Company.
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not Approved use of Cannabidiol as a Dietary Supplement.
 
The FDA has concluded that cannabidiol products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(ii) of the Food Drug and Cosmetic (“FD&C”) Act. The FDA’s ruling could have broad implications for an industry built atop the potential health benefits of CBDs, including marketing strategies and product labeling to account for such rules which state that companies cannot make claims as to proven health or medical efficacy without FDA approval. As such, even if we generally try to comply with existing FDA rules to the extent possible, compliance may not guarantee escaping regulatory scrutiny. Still, a compliance strategy should decrease risk exposure, including from truth-in-advertising claims brought by consumers related to CBD products that we intend to market.

Plan
 
CBD Biotech’s mission is to leverage our first to market advantage of promoting industrial hemp products to the largest market in the world, the Chinese mainland. To achieve this, CBD Biotech intends to leverage its strategy, marketing, staff and distribution to “grab land” and provide each customer with a terrific customer experience driving repeat revenue.
 
CBD Biotech strives to make the business competitive in the international and domestic markets. To achieve this goal, it may need to cooperate with other businesses having capital, market, technology, or products. Additionally, the Company will need to recruit and retain a talented and knowledgeable workforce and actively develop new technology and products for the market.
 Market Overview
 
Domestic Markets
 
Liquor: According to the latest population data of the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics (http://www.yanglaozhan.org/xingye/1386.html), the number of people over 60 was 294.49 million, accounting for 17.9% of the total population. This is important, because an aging population will have a greater health focus, benefitting CBD Biotech’s hemp wine product. In developed countries, the health industry accounts for 15% of GDP, but in China it only accounts for 4%-5% of GDP (http://www.sohu.com/a/276940094_100137839), providing opportunity.
 
According to a study by INS Global, the number one reason for drinking wine in China is for its health benefits. According to Wine Intelligence, only 32% of Chinese wine consumers actually drink wine because they actually enjoy the taste. Most of them, especially the young female consumers, drink wine for health and beauty purposes (https://ins-globalconsulting.com/enter-wine-market-china-2/).
 
Moreover, according to the National Bureau of statistics of China, in 2015, liquor sales were $133.8 billion, an increase of 5.3% compared with the same period of 2014. The total profit was $14.8 billion, an increase of 3.9% y/y. The sales revenue of other alcoholic beverages was $4.8 billion, an increase of 18.4% y/y, accounting for 3% of the total sales of the whole industry (health wine is classified under other alcoholic beverages in China). According to "China's Health Wine Development White Paper," the market size of the health wine market will reach to $50 billion in the next five years, growing at a 15% CAGR see https://m.21jingji.com/article/20181124/herald/9e1fa5057e60c81e329d17e290d6f203.html
 
Cosmetics: The cosmetics sector on the Chinese mainland has been growing at a fast pace in tandem with the rapid development of the Chinese economy in recent years. Online cosmetics shopping has seen rapid growth, with some mainland consumers beginning to buy cosmetics and skincare products online. According to the HKTDC survey, 69% of female respondents and 65% of male respondents would buy skincare products and cosmetics from online stores mainly because "online shopping is convenient/offers delivery service". The survey also found that female and male consumers spent RMB2,158 and RMB1,681, respectively, on online purchases of skincare products and cosmetics on average in the preceding year. See http://china-trade-research.hktdc.com/business-news/article/China-Consumer-Market/China-s-Cosmetics-Market/ccm/en/1/1X000000/ 1X002L09.htm
 
Many foreign brands have entered the mainland market by acquiring domestic brands and making use of their distribution networks. For example, MiniNurse and MG were acquired by L'Oréal, TJoy by Coty for a time, and Dabao by Johnson & Johnson. Some foreign brands are establishing their presence in the mainland market through online shopping platforms. In fact, online sales of the make-up and personal-care industries are growing at rates 11 times and eight times the respective rate of growth of sales in physical stores.

Competitive Advantages and Landscape
 
Liquor: Currently there are 5,000 health wine companies across China, but there are only three companies that produce hemp-infused wine in China, including CBD Biotech. The other two producers are both Guangxi based companies, and their products are mainly sold in their local markets. They do sell on Taobao, but their monthly sales volume on Taobao is less than 10 units, much less than CBD Biotech’s 2,000 units.
 
Cosmetics: At present, the cannabis industry in China is not large and is hindered by current laws. In 2015, Cannabis leaf extract was included the “Standard Chinese Name List of International Cosmetic Ingredients”, which was published by the China Food and Drug Administration. In November 2016, Yunnan Hansu Bio-Technology Limited was awarded the cannabis extraction and processing license issued by the Ministry of Public Security, and officially began legal research and development of cannabis extracts not containing THC. CBD Biotech currently has only one competitor in the market who manufactures cannabis-related cosmetics, Hanyi Bio-Technology Limited, a biotech company engaged in industrial cannabis in the field of biopharmaceuticals. In September 2017, this company launched the “Cannaclear Series” which includes a set of three skincare products.
 
In the international market, there are many known competitors. For example, CBD Care Garden specializes in hemp-based wellness and beauty skin care products. It has launched a set of face products and body products. Additionally, The Body Shop sells a popular product—hemp hand protector. The market seems exceptionally fragmented.
 
According to the statistics of China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA), which is now under the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), the number of enterprises qualified to produce cosmetics in China at the end of June 2018 was 3,880. Looking at the cosmetics market as a whole, domestic brands are mostly concentrated in the mid- to low-end segments, while foreign-invested enterprises and joint ventures dominated the high-end segment, given the capital requirements.
 
Because of the rapid development of domestic cosmetics companies, domestic brands’ market share is growing gradually, posing competition to their foreign counterparts. To seek new sales growth, domestic brands are applying traditional Chinese medicine concepts and natural extraction methods in developing skincare products. Examples include the Taichi Beauty Retaining series and the Extra Control series from Herborist and the Herbal Skin Whitening series from Pehchaolin.
 
The Children’s skincare products sector is also a sector with huge potential and an increasing number of international childcare heavyweights are eyeing the China market. Frog Prince, Pigeon, Yumeijing, Giving and Johnson & Johnson are major players in the children’s market. Competition is expected to become increasingly intense, but we believe we will be well served by CBD Biotechnology’s first to market presence.
 
Intellectual Property
 
CBD Biotech’s trademark application in China was approved on June 21, 2018.
 
Government Regulation
 
Although cannabis is still illegal in China, Cannabis Sativa Leaf Extract can legally be added to skincare products. As noted above in 2015, Cannabis leaf extract was included on the “Standard Chinese Name List of International Cosmetic Ingredients”, which was published by the China Food and Drug Administration.
