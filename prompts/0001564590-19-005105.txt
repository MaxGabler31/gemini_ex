ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Introduction
 The Invesco DB G10 Currency Harvest Fund (the “Fund”) was formed as a Delaware statutory trust on April 12, 2006. The term of the Fund is perpetual (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances) as provided for in the Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement of the Fund, as amended (the “Trust Agreement”). The Fund has an unlimited number of shares authorized for issuance.
 Invesco Capital Management LLC (“Invesco”) has served as the managing owner (the “Managing Owner”), commodity pool operator and a commodity trading advisor of the Fund since February 23, 2015. The Managing Owner holds 40 general shares (the “General Shares”) of the Fund. The fiscal year end of the Fund is December 31st.
The Fund seeks to track changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the Deutsche Bank G10 Currency Future Harvest Index–Excess Return™ (the “Index”) over time, plus the excess, if any, of the sum of the Fund’s interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations (“Treasury Income”), dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds (affiliated or otherwise) (“Money Market Income”) and dividends or distributions of capital gains from its holdings of T-Bill ETFs (as defined below) (“T-Bill ETF Income”) over the expenses of the Fund. The Fund invests in futures contracts in an attempt to track its Index.  The Index is designed to reflect the performance of certain currencies. The currencies comprising the Index, at any time (each an “Index Currency”, and collectively, the “Index Currencies”), are six of the following Group of Ten currencies: United States Dollars, Euros, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollars, Swiss Francs, British Pounds, Australian Dollars, New Zealand Dollars, Norwegian Krone and Swedish Krona (collectively, the “Eligible Index Currencies”). At any time, the Index will consist of long futures contracts on the three Eligible Index Currencies associated with the highest interest rates and short futures contracts on the three Eligible Index Currencies associated with the lowest interest rates. The ratio of the notional value of futures contracts in the Index to collateral used to margin those contracts is approximately 2:1 when the Index re-balances quarterly. However, if the United States Dollar is one of the Eligible Index Currencies associated with either the three highest or the three lowest interest rates, the Index will not establish a futures position, and the ratio of the notional value of futures contracts to collateral used to margin those contracts will be approximately 1.66:1 when the Index re-balances. The Fund has in the past invested at the quarterly re-balance in excess of the targeted 2:1 ratio of aggregate notional value of futures to collateral used to margin those contracts.
 The Fund may invest directly in United States Treasury Obligations. The Fund may also gain exposure to United States Treasury Obligations through investments in exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) (affiliated or otherwise) that track indexes that measure the performance of United States Treasury Obligations with a maximum remaining maturity of up to 12 months (“T-Bill ETFs”).  The Fund invests in United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds and T-Bill ETFs (affiliated or otherwise), if any, for margin and/or cash management purposes.
 The Fund offers common units of beneficial interest (the “Shares”) only to certain eligible financial institutions (the “Authorized Participants”) in one or more blocks of 200,000 Shares, called a Basket. The Fund commenced investment operations on September 15, 2006. The Fund commenced trading on the American Stock Exchange (which became the NYSE Alternext US LLC) on September 18, 2006 and, since November 25, 2008, has been listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the “NYSE Arca”).

 The currencies that are eligible for inclusion in the Index are the currencies of The Group of Ten (the “G10”) countries (the “Eligible Index Currencies”), which include the following currencies:
  
Eligible Index Currency | Symbol
------------------------+-------
United States Dollar | USD 
Euro | EUR 
Japanese Yen | JPY 
Canadian Dollar | CAD 
Swiss Franc | CHF 
British Pound | GBP 
Australian Dollar | AUD 
New Zealand Dollar | NZD 
Norwegian Krone | NOK 
Swedish Krona | SEK 

 The futures contracts referencing each of the Eligible Index Currencies (except USD) in which the Fund invests are currently traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the “CME”), although currency futures contracts on the Eligible Index Currencies also trade on other exchanges in the United States and the Fund may invest in such contracts.
 At any time, the Index is comprised of long futures positions in the three Eligible Index Currencies associated with the highest interest rates and short futures positions in the three Eligible Index Currencies associated with the lowest interest rates. The Index’s six component currencies from time-to-time, comprised of the three long and three short futures positions (each an “Index Currency”, and collectively, the “Index Currencies”), are used to calculate the value of the Index. The composition of the Index may be adjusted in the event that the Index Sponsor is not able to calculate the closing prices of the Index Currencies.

The following table reflects the Fund and Index weights of each Index Currency as of December 31, 2018:
  
Eligible Index Currency | Fund Weight (%) | | | Index Weight (%)
------------------------+-----------------+--------+----+-----------------
United States Dollar | * | | | * 
Euro | | (34.91 | )% | | (34.31 | )%
Japanese Yen | | — | | | — | 
Canadian Dollar | | 33.44 | % | | 34.04 | % 
Swiss Franc | | (34.84 | )% | | (34.40 | )%
British Pound | | — | | | — | 
Australian Dollar | | 33.58 | % | | 33.68 | % 
New Zealand Dollar | | — | | | — | 
Norwegian Krone | | — | | | — | 
Swedish Krona | | (34.68 | )% | | (34.45 | )%


* | The United States Dollar was one of the Eligible Index Currencies (as hereinafter defined) associated with the three lowest interest rates. As a result, the Fund did not establish a futures position, and the ratio of the notional value of futures contracts to collateral used to margin those contracts will be 1.66:1 when the Fund re-balances.

 Please see http://www.invesco.com/ETFs with respect 
to the most recently available weighted composition of the Fund and the composition of the Index.
 The Fund is an index tracking fund and does not utilize any trading system, whether discretionary, systematic or otherwise. The Index is a mathematical construct that is comprised of the Index Currencies, each of which is assigned an initial weight. As the value of the underlying Index Currencies changes, the relative weights of each of the Index Currencies will vary. The Index will be re-balanced at a pre-determined frequency in order to restore the target weights. As the Fund will invest in futures contracts tied to the underlying Index Currencies (and their corresponding target base weights) with a view to tracking the changes, whether positive or negative, in the changes in the levels of the Index, the Managing Owner serves in an administrative role in order to ensure that the Fund invests in a manner that seeks to track the Index.
 The composition of the Index may be adjusted in the event that the Index Sponsor is not able to calculate the closing prices of the Index Currencies. 
 The Index Sponsor calculates the Index on both an excess return basis and a total return basis. The excess return basis calculation reflects the change in market value of the applicable underlying currency futures only. The total return basis calculation reflects the sum of the change in market value of the applicable underlying currency futures plus the return on 3-month U.S. Treasury bills. The Fund seeks to track changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the Index calculated on an excess return basis, over time, plus the excess, if any, of the Fund’s Treasury Income and Money Market Income over the expenses of the Fund. The Fund may hold United States Treasury Obligations and money market mutual funds for margin and/or cash management purposes. 
 The Fund will make distributions at the discretion of the Managing Owner. To the extent that the Fund’s actual and projected Treasury Income and Money Market Income exceeds the actual and projected fees and expenses of the Fund, the Managing Owner expects periodically to make distributions of the amount of such excess. The Fund currently does not expect to make distributions with respect to its capital gains. Depending on the Fund’s performance for the taxable year and an investor’s own tax situation for such year, an investor’s income tax liability for the taxable year and allocable share of the Fund’s net ordinary income or loss and capital gain or loss may exceed any distributions an investor may receive with respect to such year.
 In order to determine which Eligible Index Currencies to include in the Index from time-to-time, the Index Sponsor will review the composition of the Index on a quarterly basis five business days prior to the IMM Date. “IMM Date” means the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December, a traditional settlement date in the International Money Market.
 The Index Sponsor will review the three month Libor rate for each Eligible Index Currency other than the SEK and NOK and will review the three month Stibor rate and the three month Nibor rate for the SEK and NOK, respectively. The Libor, Stibor and Nibor rates for the Eligible Index Currencies, as applicable, mean the London, Stockholm and Norway interbank offered rates for overnight deposits, respectively, each of which is published by Reuters. The Eligible Index Currencies are then ranked according to yield. The three highest yielding and three lowest yielding are selected as Index Currencies for inclusion in calculating the Index. If two Index Currencies have the same yield, then the previous quarter’s ranking will be used. Please see http://www.invesco.com/ETFs with respect to the most recently available weighted composition of the Fund and the composition of the Index.

The Index is re-weighted quarterly. Upon re-weighting, the high yielding Index Currencies are allocated a base weight of 33 1/3% and the low yielding Index Currencies are allocated a base weight of -33 1/3%. These new weights are applied during the Index re weighting period, which takes place between the fourth and third Index Business Days prior to the applicable IMM Date (the “Index Re-Weighting Period”).
 The CME traded futures contract of each applicable Index Currency that is closest to expiration is used in the Index calculation. The futures contracts on the Index Currencies are rolled during the Index Re-Weighting Period. The new futures contract on an Index Currency that has the next closest expiration date is selected. The calculation of the Index on an excess return basis is the weighted return on the change in price of the futures contracts on the Index Currencies.
 A 3-month U.S. Treasury bill return is then calculated and included to calculate the total return index. Please refer to Exhibit B of the Trust Agreement for the mathematical formula of the Index.
 The Index has been calculated using historical data since March 12, 1993. The Index is composed of notional amounts of each Index Currency. The notional amounts of the Index Currencies included in the Index are based on the Index Closing Level as of the Index Re-Weighting Period. The Index Closing Level reflects an arithmetic weighted return of the change in the Index Currencies’ exchange rates against the USD since March 12, 1993. March 1993 was chosen as a starting period because it represents the earliest date on which reliable data for all the Eligible Index Currencies exists. On March 12, 1993, the closing Index level was USD 100. Between March 12, 1993 to December 31, 2018, the Index level as calculated on an excess return basis has ranged from as high as USD 315.27 (July 25, 2007) to as low as USD 94.03 (July 30, 1993). Past Index results are not necessarily indicative of future changes, positive or negative, in the Index.  
 To track the Index, the Fund generally will establish long futures positions in the three Eligible Index Currencies associated with the highest interest rates and short futures positions in the three Eligible Index Currencies associated with the lowest interest rates and will adjust its holdings quarterly as the Index is adjusted. However, if the United States Dollar (“USD”) is among the Index Currencies from time-to-time, the Fund will not establish a long or short futures position (as the case may be) in USD, because USD is the Fund’s home currency and, as a consequence, the Fund can never enjoy profit or suffer loss from long or short futures positions in USD. When the USD is not associated with the highest or lowest interest rates among the Eligible Index Currencies, the aggregate notional value of the Fund’s futures contracts at the time they are established will be double the value of the Fund’s holdings of United States Treasury Obligations and money market mutual funds, which means the Fund will have a leverage ratio at such time of 2:1. If the USD is associated with the highest or lowest interest rates among the Eligible Index Currencies, the aggregate notional value of the Fund’s futures contracts at the time they are established will be approximately 1.66 times the value of the Fund’s holdings of United States Treasury Obligations and money market mutual funds, which means the Fund will have a leverage ratio at such time of approximately 1.66:1.  Holding futures positions with a notional amount in excess of the Fund’s net asset value (“NAV”) constitutes a form of leverage. The use of leverage will increase the potential for both trading profits and losses, depending on the changes, positive and negative, in the Index. The Fund’s ability to track the Index will not be affected by the presence or absence of the USD among the Index Currencies. Because the notional value of the Fund’s futures positions and holdings of United States Treasury Obligations and money market mutual funds can rise or fall over time, the leverage ratio could be higher or lower between quarterly adjustments of the Index Currencies.
 The use of long and short positions in the construction of the Index causes the Index to rise as a result of any upward price movement of Index Currencies expected to gain relative to the USD and to rise as a result of any downward price movement of Index Currencies expected to lose relative to the USD. The inclusion of both long and short positions is also expected to reduce the country specific foreign exchange risk of the Index (and, therefore, risk in connection with an investment in the Fund) relative to a directional (outright long or short) exposure to any or all of the Index Currencies.
 There can be no assurance that the use of both long and short positions will reduce the volatility of the Index during any or all market cycles or performance periods, or that the Fund will achieve its objectives. It is possible that, prior to an Index rebalancing, that Index Currencies expected to lose relative to the USD may rise and/or Index Currencies expected to gain relative to the USD may fall. In such cases, the Fund may experience losses in both its long and short positions at the same time. Such losses will be greater as a result of the Fund’s use of leverage, reflected in its long futures exposure to Index Currencies with a notional value of up to 100% of the Fund’s NAV and its short futures exposure to Index Currencies with a notional value of up to 100% of the Fund’s NAV. Under such circumstances, the Fund’s losses would be greater as a result of its leverage than would be the case were it to limit its overall exposure to Index Currencies with a notional value of 100% of the Fund’s NAV.
 As a result of its use of leverage, the Fund will be required to deposit a greater proportion of its net assets as margin, not expected to exceed 10% of net assets. This represents margin deposit requirements approximately twice as great as would be required if the Fund did not use leverage. Similarly, as a result of its use of leverage, the Fund will trade more futures contracts and incur more 
 4


brokerage commission expense than it would if it did not use leverage. The additional amount of brokerage commission expense generally will be proportional to the Fund’s leverage ratio.
 The Trustee
 Under the Trust Agreement, Wilmington Trust Company, the trustee of the Fund (the “Trustee”), has the power and authority to execute and file certificates as required by the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and to accept service of process on the Fund in the State of Delaware.

 The Fund may, for margin and/or cash management purposes, invest in money market mutual funds and/or T-Bill ETFs that are managed by affiliates of the Managing Owner. The indirect portion of the management fee that the Fund may incur through such investment is in addition to the Management Fee paid to the Managing Owner. The Managing Owner has contractually agreed to waive indefinitely the fees that it receives in an amount equal to the indirect management fees that the Fund incurs through its investments in affiliated money market mutual funds and/or affiliated T-Bill ETFs. The Managing Owner may terminate this fee waiver on 60 days notice.

 Regulation
 Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act by the CFTC, the governmental agency having responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and trading on those exchanges. 
 The Commodity Exchange Act and the CFTC also regulate the activities of “commodity trading advisors” and “commodity pool operators” and the CFTC has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons’ activities. Pursuant to its authority, the CFTC requires a commodity pool operator (such as the Managing Owner) to keep accurate, current and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates. The CFTC may suspend the registration of a commodity pool operator if the CFTC finds that the operator has violated the Commodity Exchange Act or regulations thereunder and in certain other circumstances. Suspension, restriction or termination of the Managing Owner’s registration as a commodity pool operator would prevent it, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, from managing, and might result in the termination of, the Fund. The Commodity Exchange Act gives the CFTC similar authority with respect to the activities of commodity trading advisors, such as the Managing Owner. If the registration of a managing owner as a commodity trading advisor were to be terminated, restricted or suspended, the managing owner would be unable, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, to render trading advice to the Fund. The Fund is not registered with the CFTC in any capacity.
 The Commodity Exchange Act requires all “futures commission merchants,” such as the Commodity Broker, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers’ funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC.
 The Commodity Exchange Act also gives the states certain powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC.
 Shareholders are afforded certain rights for reparations under the Commodity Exchange Act. Shareholders may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the Commodity Exchange Act against a floor broker, futures commission merchant, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator, and their respective associated persons.
 Pursuant to authority in the Commodity Exchange Act, the NFA was formed and registered with the CFTC as a “registered futures association.” At the present time, the NFA is the only non-exchange self-regulatory organization for derivatives professionals. NFA members are subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, market integrity, and consumer protection. As the self-regulatory body of the derivatives industry, the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of derivatives professionals and disciplines those professionals who do not comply with such standards. The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, and swap dealers, among others, and their respective associated persons, as applicable, and floor brokers. The Commodity Broker and the Managing Owner are members of the NFA (the Fund is not required to become a member of the NFA).
 The CFTC has no authority to regulate trading on foreign futures exchanges and markets but permits direct access to such markets from the United States with respect to foreign boards of trade that are registered as such with the CFTC.
