 Item 1.  Business
General
Ensco plc is a global offshore contract drilling company. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms "Ensco," "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to Ensco plc together with all its subsidiaries and predecessors.
We are one of the leading providers of offshore contract drilling services to the international oil and gas industry. We currently own and operate an offshore drilling rig fleet of 62 rigs, with drilling operations in most of the strategic markets around the globe. We also have three rigs under construction. Our rig fleet includes12 drillships, 11 dynamically positioned semisubmersible rigs, four moored semisubmersible rigs and 38 jackup rigs, including rigs under construction.  We operate the world's largest fleet amongst competitive rigs, including one of the newest ultra-deepwater fleets in the industry and a leading premium jackup fleet.
Our customers include many of the leading national and international oil companies, in addition to many independent operators. We are among the most geographically diverse offshore drilling companies, with current operations spanning 14 countries on six continents. The markets in which we operate include the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, the Mediterranean, the North Sea, the Middle East, West Africa, Australia and Southeast Asia.
We provide drilling services on a "day rate" contract basis. Under day rate contracts, we provide a drilling rig and rig crews for which we receive a daily rate that may vary throughout the duration of the contractual term. The day rate we earn can vary between the full day rate and zero rate, depending on the operations of the rig. Our customers bear substantially all of the costs of constructing the well and supporting drilling operations, as well as the economic risk relative to the success of the well. In addition, our customers may pay all or a portion of the cost of moving our equipment and personnel to and from the well site. 
Ensco plc is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales in 2009. Our principal executive office is located at 6 Chesterfield Gardens, London W1J5BQ, England, United Kingdom, and our telephone number is +44 (0) 20 7659 4660.  Our website is www.enscoplc.com.  Information contained on our website is not included as part of, or incorporated by reference into, this report.
Atwood Merger
On October 6, 2017 (the "Merger Date"), we completed a merger transaction (the "Merger") with Atwood Oceanics, Inc. ("Atwood") and Echo Merger Sub, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ensco plc. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Echo Merger Sub, LLC, merged with and into Atwood, with Atwood as the surviving entity and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ensco plc. Total consideration delivered in the Merger consisted of 132.2 million of our Class A ordinary shares and $11.1 million of cash in settlement of certain share-based payment awards. The total aggregate value of consideration transferred was $781.8 million. Additionally, upon closing of the Merger, we utilized cash acquired of $445.4 million and cash on hand to extinguish Atwood's revolving credit facility, outstanding senior notes and accrued interest totaling $1.3 billion. The estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired net of liabilities assumed exceeded the consideration transferred, resulting in a bargain purchase gain of $140.2 million that was recognized during the fourth quarter.
Drilling Rig Construction and Delivery
We remain focused on our long-established strategy of high-grading our fleet, as evidenced by the recently completed Merger. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, we invested approximately $1.9 billion in the construction of new drilling rigs. We will continue to invest in the expansion and high-grading of our fleet or execute other strategic transactions to optimize our asset portfolio when we believe attractive opportunities exist.

We believe our remaining capital commitments will primarily be funded from cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, operating cash flows and, if necessary, funds borrowed under our revolving credit facility. We may decide to access debt and/or equity markets to raise additional capital or increase liquidity as necessary.
Floaters
We previously entered into agreements with Samsung Heavy Industries to construct three ultra-deepwater drillships (ENSCO DS-8, ENSCO DS-9 and ENSCO DS-10). During 2015, we accepted delivery of ENSCO DS-8 and ENSCO DS-9. ENSCO DS-8 commenced drilling operations under a long-term contract in Angola during 2015 and ENSCO DS-9 is actively being marketed. During 2017, we executed a one-year contract with five one-year priced options for ENSCO DS-10. As a result of the contract award, we accelerated delivery of ENSCO DS-10, which had previously been deferred into 2019, and made the final milestone payment of $75.0 million. We expect ENSCO DS-10 to commence drilling operations offshore Nigeria in March 2018.
In connection with the Merger, we acquired two ultra-deepwater drillships, ENSCO DS-13 (formerly Atwood Admiral) and ENSCO DS-14 (formerly Atwood Archer), which are currently under construction in the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. Ltd. ("DSME") yard in South Korea. ENSCO DS-13 and ENSCO DS-14 are scheduled for delivery in the third quarter of 2019 and second quarter of 2020, respectively. Upon delivery, the remaining milestone payments and accrued interest thereon may be financed through a promissory note with the shipyard for each rig. The promissory notes will bear interest at a rate of 5% per annum with a maturity date of December 31, 2022 and will be secured by a mortgage on each respective rig.
Jackups
During 2014, we entered into an agreement with Lamprell Energy Limited ("Lamprell") to construct two premium jackup rigs. ENSCO 140 and ENSCO 141 are significantly enhanced versions of the LeTourneau Super 116E jackup design and incorporate Ensco's patented Canti-Leverage AdvantageSM technology. ENSCO 140 and ENSCO 141 were delivered during 2016. Both rigs are expected to obtain drilling contracts for work commencing during 2018. As part of our agreement with Lamprell, these rigs will be warm stacked in the shipyard at no additional cost to us for up to two years from their respective delivery dates.
We previously entered into agreements with Keppel FELS ("KFELS") to construct four ultra-premium harsh environment jackup rigs (ENSCO 120, ENSCO 121, ENSCO 122 and ENSCO 123) and a premium jackup rig (ENSCO 110). ENSCO 120 and ENSCO 121 were delivered during 2013 and ENSCO 122 and ENSCO 110 were delivered during 2014 and 2015, respectively. During 2016, we agreed with the shipyard to delay delivery of ENSCO 123 until the first quarter of 2018. In December 2017, we agreed to further delay delivery of ENSCO 123 until the first quarter of 2019, and in January 2018, we paid $207.4 million of the $218.3 million unpaid balance with the remainder due upon delivery. ENSCO 123 is currently uncontracted and is actively being marketed.
Divestitures
Our business strategy has been to focus on ultra-deepwater floater and premium jackup operations and de-emphasize other assets and operations that are not part of our long-term strategic plan or that no longer meet our standards for economic returns. Consistent with this strategy, we sold nine jackup rigs, three dynamically positioned semisubmersible rigs, two moored semisubmersible rigs and two drillships during the three-year period ended December 31, 2017. We are marketing for sale ENSCO 7500, which was classified as held-for-sale in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017. 
Following the Merger, we continue to focus on our fleet management strategy in light of the new composition of our rig fleet and are reviewing our fleet composition as we continue positioning Ensco for the future. As part of this strategy, we may act opportunistically from time to time to monetize assets to enhance shareholder value and improve our liquidity profile, in addition to selling or disposing of older, lower-specification or non-core rigs.

Contract Drilling Operations
Our business consists of three operating segments: (1) Floaters, which includes our drillships and semisubmersible rigs, (2) Jackups and (3) Other, which consists of management services on rigs owned by third-parties. Our two reportable segments, Floaters and Jackups, provide one service, contract drilling. 
  Of our 65 rigs, 32 are located in the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific (including three rigs under construction), 14 are located in North and South America (including Brazil) and 19 are located in Europe and the Mediterranean.

Our drilling rigs drill and complete oil and natural gas wells. From time to time, our drilling rigs may be utilized as accommodation units or for non-drilling services, such as workovers and interventions, plug and abandonment and decommissioning work. Demand for our drilling services is based upon many factors beyond our control. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - The success of our business largely depends on the level of activities in the oil and gas industry, which can be significantly affected by volatile oil and natural gas prices.”
Our drilling contracts are the result of negotiations with our customers, and most contracts are awarded upon competitive bidding. The terms of our drilling contracts can vary significantly, but generally contain the following commercial terms:

• | contract duration or term for a specific period of time or a period necessary to drill one or more wells,


• | term extension options in favor of our customer, exercisable upon advance notice to us, at mutually agreed, indexed, fixed rates or current rate at the date of extension,


• | provisions permitting early termination of the contract (i) if the rig is lost or destroyed, (ii) if operations are suspended for a specified period of time due to various events, including damage or breakdown of major rig equipment, unsatisfactory performance, or "force majeure" events or (iii) at the convenience (without cause) of the customer (in certain cases obligating the customer to pay us an early termination fee providing some level of compensation to us for the remaining term),


• | payment of compensation to us (generally in U.S. dollars although some contracts require a portion of the compensation to be paid in local currency) on a "day work" basis such that we receive a fixed amount for each day ("day rate") that the drilling unit is under contract (lower day rates generally apply for limited periods when operations are suspended due to various events, including during delays that are beyond our reasonable control, during repair of equipment damage or breakdown and during periods of re-drilling damaged portions of the well, and no day rate ("zero rate") generally applies when these limited periods are exceeded until the event is remediated, and during periods to remediate unsatisfactory performance or other specified conditions),


• | payment by us of the operating expenses of the drilling unit, including crew labor and incidental rig supply and maintenance costs,


• | mobilization and demobilization requirements of us to move the drilling unit to and from the planned drilling site, and may include reimbursement of a portion of these moving costs by the customer in the form of an up-front payment, additional day rate over the contract term or direct reimbursement, and


• | provisions allowing us to recover certain labor and other operating cost increases, including certain cost increases due to changes in applicable law, from our customers through day rate adjustment or direct reimbursement for contracts with terms in excess of one year.

6

In general, recent contract awards have been subject to an extremely competitive bidding process. The intense pressure on operating day rates has resulted in rates that approximate direct operating expenses and contain other less favorable contractual and commercial terms, including reduced or no mobilization and/or demobilization fees; reduced day rates or zero day rates during downtime due to damage or failure of our equipment; reduced standby, redrill and moving rates and reduced periods in which such rates are payable; reduced caps on reimbursements for lost or damaged downhole tools; reduced periods to remediate downtime due to equipment breakdowns or failure to perform in accordance with the contractual standards of performance before the operator may terminate the contract; certain limitations on our ability to be indemnified from operator and third party damages caused by our fault, resulting in increases in the nature and amounts of liability allocated to us; and reduced or no early termination fees and/or termination notice periods.
Financial information regarding our operating segments and geographic regions is presented in Note 13 and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Additional financial information regarding our operating segments is presented in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Backlog Information
Our contract drilling backlog reflects commitments, represented by signed drilling contracts, and was calculated by multiplying the contracted day rate by the contract period. The contracted day rate excludes certain types of lump sum fees for rig mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation, as well as customer reimbursables and bonus opportunities. Contract backlog was adjusted for drilling contracts signed or terminated after each respective balance sheet date but prior to filing each of our annual reports on Form 10-K on February 27, 2018 and February 28, 2017, respectively. 
The following table summarizes our contract backlog of business as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):

 | 2017 | | 2016
Floaters | $ | 1,578.3 | | | $ | 2,154.9
Jackups | 1,013.0 | | | 1,185.0 | 
Other | 229.7 | | | 281.4 | 
Total | $ | 2,821.0 | | | $ | 3,621.3

As of December 31, 2017, our backlog was $2.8 billion as compared to $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2016. Our floater backlog declined $576.6 million primarily due to revenues realized during 2017, partially offset by contract extensions and new contract awards. The remaining $223.7 million decline primarily related to our jackups segment and was largely due to revenues realized during 2017, contract concessions and contract terminations, partially offset by contract extensions and new contract awards.

The following table summarizes our contract backlog of business as of December 31, 2017 and the periods in which such revenues are expected to be realized (in millions):

 | 2018 | | 2019 | | 2020 | | 2021and Beyond | Total
Floaters | $ | 851.2 | | | $ | 519.7 | | $ | 207.4 | $ | — | $ | 1,578.3
Jackups | 499.1 | | | 214.6 | | | 137.5 | | 161.8 | 1,013.0 | 
Other | 56.7 | | | 56.7 | | | 56.9 | | 59.4 | 229.7 | 
Total | $ | 1,407.0 | | | $ | 791.0 | | $ | 401.8 | $ | 221.2 | $ | 2,821.0

Our drilling contracts generally contain provisions permitting early termination of the contract (i) if the rig is lost or destroyed or (ii) by the customer if operations are suspended for a specified period of time due to breakdown of major rig equipment, unsatisfactory performance, "force majeure" events beyond the control of either party or other specified conditions.  In addition, our drilling contracts generally permit early termination of the contract by the customer for convenience (without cause), exercisable upon advance notice to us, and in some cases without making an early termination payment to us.  There can be no assurances that our customers will be able to or willing to fulfill their contractual commitments to us.  
The amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different from amounts disclosed in our backlog calculations due to a lack of predictability of various factors, including unscheduled repairs, maintenance requirements, newbuild rig delivery dates, weather delays, contract terminations or renegotiations and other factors. 
See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our current backlog of contract drilling revenue may not be fully realized and may decline significantly in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors - We may suffer losses if our customers terminate or seek to renegotiate our contracts, if operations are suspended or interrupted or if a rig becomes a total loss.”
Drilling Contracts and Insurance Program 
Our drilling contracts provide for varying levels of allocation of responsibility for liability between our customer and us for loss or damage to each party's property and third-party property, personal injuries and other claims arising out of our drilling operations. We also maintain insurance for personal injuries, damage to or loss of property and certain business risks. 

Our insurance policies typically consist of 12-month policy periods, and the next renewal date for a substantial portion of our insurance program is scheduled for May 31, 2018. Our insurance program provides coverage, subject to the policies' terms and conditions and to the extent not otherwise assumed by the customer under the indemnification provisions of the drilling contract, for third-party claims arising from our operations, including third-party claims arising from well-control events, named windstorms, sudden and accidental pollution originating from our rigs, wrongful death and personal injury. Third-party pollution claims could also arise from damage to adjacent pipelines and from spills of fluids maintained on the drilling unit. Generally, our program provides liability coverage up to $750.0 million, with a per occurrence deductible of $10.0 million or less. We retain the risk for liability not indemnified by the customer in excess of our insurance coverage.
Well-control events generally include an unintended flow from the well that cannot be contained by using equipment on site (e.g., a blowout preventer), by increasing the weight of drilling fluid or by diverting the fluids safely into production facilities. In addition to the third-party coverage described above, for claims relating to a well-control event, we also have $150.0 million of coverage available to pay costs of controlling and re-drilling of the well and third-party pollution claims.
Our insurance program also provides first party coverage to us for physical damage to, including total loss or constructive total loss of, our rigs, generally excluding damage arising from a named windstorm in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This coverage is based on an agreed amount for each rig and has a per occurrence deductible for losses ranging from $15.0 million to $25.0 million. Due to the significant premium, high deductible and limited coverage, we decided not to purchase first party windstorm insurance for our rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Accordingly, we have retained the risk for windstorm damage to our six jackups and six floaters in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
Our drilling contracts customarily provide that each party is responsible for injuries or death to their respective personnel and loss or damage to their respective property (including the personnel and property of each parties’ contractors and subcontractors) regardless of the cause of the loss or damage. However, in certain drilling contracts our customer’s responsibility for damage to its property and the property of its other contractors contains an exception to the extent the loss or damage is due to our negligence, which exception is usually subject to negotiated caps on a 
8

per occurrence basis, although in some cases we assume responsibility for all damages due to our negligence.  In addition, our drilling contracts typically provide for our customers to indemnify us, generally based on replacement cost minus some level of depreciation, for loss or damage to our down-hole equipment, and in some cases for a limited amount of the replacement cost of our subsea equipment, unless the damage is caused by our negligence, normal wear and tear or defects in our equipment.
Subject to the exceptions noted below, our customers typically assume most of the responsibility for and indemnify us from any loss, damage or other liability resulting from pollution or contamination arising from operations, including as a result of blowouts, cratering and seepage, when the source of the pollution originates from the well or reservoir, including costs for clean-up and removal of pollution and third-party damages. In most drilling contracts, we assume liability for third-party damages resulting from such pollution and contamination caused by our negligence, usually subject to negotiated caps on a per occurrence or per event basis. In addition, in substantially all of our contracts, the customer assumes responsibility and indemnifies us for loss or damage to the reservoir, for loss of hydrocarbons escaping from the reservoir and for the costs of bringing the well under control.  Further, subject to the exceptions noted below, most of our contracts provide that the customer assumes responsibility and indemnifies us for loss or damage to the well, except when the loss or damage to the well is due to our negligence, in which case most of our contracts provide that the customer's sole remedy is to require us to redrill the lost or damaged portion of the well at a substantially reduced rate and, in some cases, pay for some of the costs to repair the well.
Most of our drilling contracts incorporate a broad exclusion that limits the operator's indemnity for damages and losses resulting from our gross negligence and willful misconduct and for fines and penalties and punitive damages levied or assessed directly against us. This exclusion overrides other provisions in the contract that would otherwise limit our liability for ordinary negligence. In most of these cases, we are still able to negotiate a liability cap (although these caps are significantly higher than the caps we are able to negotiate for ordinary negligence) on our exposure for losses or damages resulting from our gross negligence. In certain cases, the broad exclusion only applies to losses or damages resulting from the gross negligence of our senior supervisory personnel. However, in some cases we have contractually assumed significantly increased exposure or unlimited exposure for losses and damages due to the gross negligence of some or all our personnel, and in most cases, we are not able to contractually limit our exposure for our willful misconduct. 
Notwithstanding our negotiation of express limitations in our drilling contracts for losses or damages resulting from our ordinary negligence and any express limitations (albeit usually much higher) for losses or damages in the event of our gross negligence, under the applicable laws that govern certain of our drilling contracts, the courts will not enforce any indemnity for losses and damages that result from our gross negligence or willful misconduct. As a result, under the laws of such jurisdictions, the indemnification provisions of our drilling contracts that would otherwise limit our liability in the event of our gross negligence or willful misconduct are deemed to be unenforceable as being contrary to public policy, and we are exposed to unlimited liability for losses and damages that result from our gross negligence or willful misconduct, regardless of any express limitation of our liability in the relevant drilling contracts. Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, an indemnity from an operator for losses or damages of third parties resulting from our gross negligence is enforceable but an indemnity for losses or damages of the operator is not enforceable. In such cases, the contractual indemnity obligation of the operator to us would be enforceable with respect to third-party claims for losses of damages, such as may arise in pollution claims, but the contractual indemnity obligation of the operator to us with respect to injury or death to the operator's personnel, the operator’s damages to the well, to the reservoir and for the costs of well control would not be enforceable. Furthermore, although there is a lack of precedential authority for these types of claims in countries where the civil law is applied, in those situations where a fault based codified civil law system is applicable to our drilling contracts, as opposed to the common law system, the courts generally will not enforce a contractual indemnity clause that totally indemnifies us from losses or damages due to our gross negligence, but may enforce the contractual indemnity over and above a cap on our liability for gross negligence, assuming the cap requires us to accept a significant amount of liability.
Similar to gross negligence, regardless of any express limitations in a drilling contract regarding our liability for fines and penalties and punitive damages, the laws of most jurisdictions will not enforce an indemnity that indemnifies a party for a fine or penalty that is levied or punitive damages that are assessed directly against such party 
9

on the ground that it is against public policy to indemnify a party from a fine and penalty or punitive damages, especially where the purpose of such levy or assessment is to deter the behavior that resulted in the fine or penalty or punish such party for the behavior that warranted the assessment of punitive damages. 
The above description of our insurance program and the indemnification provisions of our drilling contracts is only a summary as of the date hereof and is general in nature. In addition, our drilling contracts are individually negotiated, and the degree of indemnification we receive from operators against the liabilities discussed above can vary from contract to contract, based on market conditions and customer requirements existing when the contract was negotiated and the interpretation and enforcement of applicable law when the claim is adjudicated. Notwithstanding a contractual indemnity from a customer, there can be no assurance that our customers will be financially able to indemnify us or will otherwise honor a contractual indemnity obligation that is enforceable under applicable law. Our insurance program and the terms of our drilling contracts may change in the future. 
In certain cases, vendors who provide equipment or services to us limit their pollution liability to a specific monetary cap, and we assume the liability above that cap. Typically, in the case of original equipment manufacturers, the cap is a negotiated amount based on mutual agreement of the parties considering the risk profiles and thresholds of each party. However, for smaller vendors, the liability is usually limited to the value, or double the value, of the contract.
We generally indemnify the customer for legal and financial consequences of spills of waste oil, fuels, lubricants, motor oils, pipe dope, paint, solvents, ballast, bilge, garbage, debris, sewage, hazardous waste and other liquids, the discharge of which originates from our rigs or equipment above the surface of the water and in some cases from our subsea equipment. Our contracts generally provide that, in the event of any such spill from our rigs, we are responsible for fines and penalties.
Major Customers
We provide our contract drilling services to major international, government-owned and independent oil and gas companies. During 2017, our five largest customers accounted for 66% of consolidated revenues. Total, BP and Petrobras, our largest customers, accounted for 22%, 15% and 11% of consolidated revenues, respectively.
Competition
The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive. Drilling contracts are, for the most part, awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price competition is often the primary factor in determining which contractor is awarded a contract, although quality of service, operational and safety performance, equipment suitability and availability, location of equipment, reputation and technical expertise also are factors.  There are numerous competitors with significant resources in the offshore contract drilling industry.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
Our operations are affected by political initiatives and by laws and regulations that relate to the oil and gas industry, including laws and regulations that have or may impose increased financial responsibility and oil spill abatement contingency plan capability requirements. Accordingly, we will be directly affected by the approval and adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and natural gas for economic, environmental, safety or other policy reasons. It is also possible that these laws and regulations and political initiatives could adversely affect our operations in the future by significantly increasing our operating costs or restricting areas open for drilling activity.  See "Item 1A. Risk Factors- Increasing regulatory complexity could adversely impact the costs associated with our offshore drilling operations."
10

Our operations are subject to laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, pollution, contamination and hazardous waste disposal or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Environmental laws and regulations specifically applicable to our business activities could impose significant liability on us for damages, clean-up costs, fines and penalties in the event of oil spills or similar discharges of pollutants or contaminants into the environment or improper disposal of hazardous waste generated in the course of our operations, which may not be covered by contractual indemnification or insurance, or for which indemnity is prohibited by applicable law and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows. To date, such laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results, and we have not experienced an accident that has exposed us to material liability arising out of or relating to discharges of pollutants into the environment.  However, the legislative, judicial and regulatory response to any well-control incidents could substantially increase our customers' liabilities in respect of oil spills and also could increase our liabilities. In addition to potential increased liabilities, such legislative, judicial or regulatory action could impose increased financial, insurance or other requirements that may adversely impact the entire offshore drilling industry.
The International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1992, the U.K. Merchant Shipping Act 1995, Marpol 73/78 (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), the U.K. Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation Convention) Regulations 1998, as amended, and other related legislation and regulations and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA 90"), as amended, the Clean Water Act and other U.S. federal statutes applicable to us and our operations, as well as similar statutes in Texas, Louisiana, other coastal states and other non-U.S. jurisdictions, address oil spill prevention, reporting and control and have significantly expanded potential liability, fine and penalty exposure across many segments of the oil and gas industry. Such statutes and related regulations impose a variety of obligations on us related to the prevention of oil spills, disposal of waste and liability for resulting damages. For instance, OPA 90 imposes strict and, with limited exceptions, joint and several liability upon each responsible party for oil removal costs as well as a variety of fines, penalties and damages. Similar environmental laws apply in our other areas of operation. Failure to comply with these statutes and regulations, including OPA 90, may subject us to civil or criminal enforcement action, which may not be covered by contractual indemnification or insurance, or for which indemnity is prohibited under applicable law, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows.
High-profile and catastrophic events such as the 2010 Macondo well incident, have heightened governmental and environmental concerns about the oil and gas industry. From time to time, legislative proposals have been introduced that would materially limit or prohibit offshore drilling in certain areas.  We are adversely affected by restrictions on drilling in certain areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere, including the adoption of additional safety requirements and policies regarding the approval of drilling permits and restrictions on development and production activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico that have and may further impact our operations. 
As a result of Macondo, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement ("BSEE") issued a drilling safety rule in 2012 that included requirements for the cementing of wells, well-control barriers, blowout preventers, well-control fluids, well completions, workovers and decommissioning operations. BSEE also issued regulations requiring operators to have safety and environmental management systems ("SEMS") prior to conducting operations and requiring operators and contractors to agree on how the contractors will assist the operators in complying with the SEMS. In addition, in August 2012, BSEE issued an Interim Policy Document ("IPD") stating that it would begin issuing Incidents of Non-Compliance ("INC's") to contractors as well as operators for serious violations of BSEE regulations. Following federal court decisions successfully challenging the scope of BSEE’s jurisdiction over offshore contractors, this IPD has been removed from the list of IPDs on the BSEE website. If this judicial precedent stands, it may reduce regulatory and civil litigation liability exposures.
In late 2014, the United States Coast Guard ("USCG") proposed new regulations that would impose GPS equipment and positioning requirements for mobile offshore drilling units and jackup rigs operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and issued notices regarding the development of guidelines for cybersecurity measures used in the marine and offshore energy sectors for all vessels and facilities that are subject to the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 ("MTSA"), including our rigs. The regulations imposing GPS equipment and positioning requirements have 
11

not yet been issued. On July 12, 2017, the USCG announced the availability of and requested comments on draft guidelines for addressing cyber risks at MTSA-regulated facilities. On July 28, 2016, BSEE adopted a new well-control rule that will be implemented in phases over the next several years (the "2016 Well Control Rule"). This new rule includes more stringent design requirements for well-control equipment used in offshore drilling operations. We are continuing to evaluate the cost and effect that these new rules will have on our operations. Based on our current assessment of the rules, we do not expect to incur significant costs to comply with the 2016 Well Control Rule. The 2016 Well Control Rule is currently under review by BSEE pursuant to Executive Order (“EO”) 13783 (“Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth”) and Section 7 of EO 13795 (“Implementing an America-First Offshore Energy Strategy”), to determine if the rule should be revised to encourage energy exploration and production on the Outer Continental Shelf, while still providing for safe and environmentally responsible exploration and production activities. 

The continuing and evolving threat of cyber attacks will likely require increased expenditures to strengthen cyber risk management systems for MODUs and onshore facilities. For example, on May 11, 2017, President Trump issued EO 13800, entitled Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure, which is intended to improve the nation's ability to defend against increasing and evolving cyber attacks, and in July 2017 the USCG issued proposed cybersecurity guidelines for port facilities and offshore facilities, including mobile offshore drilling units, that could be impacted by cyber attacks. We cannot currently estimate the future expenditures associated with increased regulatory requirements, which may be material, and we continue to monitor regulatory changes as they occur.

If new laws are enacted or other government actions are taken that restrict or prohibit offshore drilling in our principal areas of operation or impose additional regulatory (including environmental protection) requirements that materially increase the liabilities, financial requirements or operating or equipment costs associated with offshore drilling, exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas, our financial position, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.  See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Compliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations." 
Non-U.S. Operations
Revenues from non-U.S. operations were 92%, 81% and 72% of our total consolidated revenues during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our non-U.S. operations and shipyard rig construction and enhancement projects are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties, including:

• | terrorist acts, war and civil disturbances,


• | expropriation, nationalization, deprivation or confiscation of our equipment or our customer's property,
