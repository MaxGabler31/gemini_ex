11 

  organize our go-to-market approach by focusing our sales and marketing teams on selling to organizations in a wide range of industries, who generally want to monetize video content by distributing it to a broad audience or use video for sales, marketing, education, employee training, or enterprise communication purposes.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operations 
 We have relationships with a number of third-party cloud computing platforms to provide our products and services to customers, and we believe that our agreements with these platforms are based on competitive market terms and conditions, including service level commitments. We take advantage of this geographically dispersed, third-party, cloud computing capacity to improve the responsiveness of our service and lower network latency for our customers. 
 Media delivery to end users, including video, audio, images and JavaScript components, is served primarily through CDN providers, including Akamai, Fastly, and AWS Cloudfront. We believe our agreements with our CDN providers are based on competitive market terms and conditions, including service level commitments from these CDN providers. 
 We entered into our initial agreement with Akamai in July 2010. It enables us to use Akamai CDN services for our own benefit and to resell Akamai CDN services to our customers. The current expiration date of the agreement is April 30, 2022. 
 We entered into our initial agreement with Fastly in May 2020. It enables us to use Fastly CDN services for our own benefit and to resell Fastly CDN services to our customers. The current expiration date of the agreement is April 30, 2022. 
 Our agreements with each of Akamai and Fastly contain a service continuation period following expiration of the agreement, which we believe is sufficient to enable transition to an alternative provider to avoid material disruption to our business or to our customers. Our agreement with Akamai provides that, upon termination, 
 
12 

  Akamai will continue to provide CDN services to our existing customers for up to twelve months. Our agreement with Fastly provides that, upon termination by Fastly, Fastly will continue to provide CDN services for up to six months. 
 We use AWS to provide cloud-based computing, storage and CDN services to our customers. We entered into our initial agreement with AWS on May 17, 2012. The current expiration date of our agreement with AWS is June 30, 2022. Our agreement with AWS provides that, upon termination, AWS will continue to store our content for 30 days and will, upon mutual agreement, provide additional post-termination assistance. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely principally on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, confidential information, business strategies and brands. We also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our employees coupled with the creation of new features, functionality and products are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with other third parties, and we rigorously control access to our proprietary technology. 
 In the United States, we have 52 issued and/or allowed patents and 7 patent applications pending. Internationally, we have 42 issued and/or allowed patents and we are currently pursuing 23 patent applications, including two patent applications undergoing examination at the European Patent Office. We currently have patent applications pending in the United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, Brazil, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Japan, and Singapore, and we may seek coverage in additional jurisdictions to the extent we determine such coverage is appropriate and cost-effective. Our issued patents cover a variety of technical domains relevant to our business, including aspects of publishing and distributing digital media online, cloud-based stream delivery and ad insertion. 
 Our registered trademarks in the United States include “BRIGHTCOVE”, “ZENCODER”, “VIDEO THAT MEANS BUSINESS”, and our logo. Some of our trademarks are also registered in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Japan and Canada. We may apply for registrations of other marks, and of these marks in additional jurisdictions, to the extent we determine such coverage is appropriate and cost-effective. 
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products with the same functionality as our solutions. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and expensive. Our competitors could also independently develop technologies equivalent to ours, and our intellectual property rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from selling products incorporating those technologies. 
 Competition 
 We compete with video-sharing sites, in-house solutions, online video platforms and a broad range of other technology providers. Some of our actual and potential competitors may enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as larger marketing budgets and larger sales teams, as well as greater financial, technical and other resources. The overall markets for our products are fragmented, rapidly evolving and highly competitive. 
 We expect that the competitive landscape will change as our markets consolidate and mature. We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry include the following: 
 

• | total cost of ownership;
--+-------------------------


• | breadth and depth of product functionality;
--+--------------------------------------------



13 

  
• | ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | level of resources and investment in sales, marketing, product and technology;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ease of deployment and use of solutions;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | level of integration into existing workflows, configurability, scalability and reliability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer service;
--+------------------


• | brand awareness and reputation;
--+--------------------------------


• | ability to integrate with third-party applications and technologies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | size and scale of provider; and
--+--------------------------------


• | size of customer base and level of user adoption.
--+--------------------------------------------------


The mix of factors relevant in any given situation varies with regard to each prospective customer. We believe we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors. 
 Some of our competitors have made or may make acquisitions or enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive service than we do. These combinations may make it more difficult for us to compete effectively, including on the basis of price, sales and marketing programs, technology or service functionality. We expect these challenges to continue as organizations attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions. 
 Research and Development 
 We have focused our research and development efforts on maintaining a leading video streaming platform that is reliable, scalable, and open; cultivating an intelligent video cloud powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning; and leveraging our video and audience insights to provide value to our customers in the form of tangible solutions. We have expanded, and will continue to expand the functionality, scalability, and security of our products and enhance their ease of use, and we continue to invest in creating new product offerings. We have created a Chief Data Officer role to steer our development of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data strategies. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we intend to continue to lead in the development of new technologies, regularly release new features and functionality, expand our product offerings and upgrade and extend our service offerings. Over the long term, we believe that research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue will decrease, but will vary depending upon the mix of revenue from new and existing products, features and functionality, as well as changes in the technology that our products must support, such as new operating systems or new Internet-connected devices. 
Human Capital Resources 
 Brightcove employees are a team of smart, passionate people who are revolutionizing the way organizations deliver video experiences. As of December 31, 2021, we had 687 employees, of which 318 were located in the United States and 369 were located outside of the United States. None of our United States employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We have a high degree of employee engagement, as demonstrated through participation in employee surveys, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
 We have built a culture around three core values, all of which guide us in delivering at the highest level on behalf of our customers: Execution, Innovation, and One Team. We recognize that maintaining our culture and realizing these values depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain talent. To that end, we offer high quality benefits, including work-from-home flexibility and wellness initiatives, which take into account the diversity of our employees’ lifestyles and needs. Our leadership speaks with transparency at regular all-employee

  town hall meetings, and we create opportunities for employee feedback, including through engagement surveys and our Employee Action Committee. Leveraging the power of our own video products, we provide a comprehensive library of training videos to all employees, as well as targeted training to our leadership team.
 We are committed to diversity at all levels of our organization, from our Board of Directors, where a majority of members are from underrepresented groups, to our employees. We have established hiring processes, training, and partnerships with organizations to drive diversity and inclusion among our workforce. Programs such as our employee resource groups provide community and support for our employees. 
 Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, we have remained focused first and foremost on the safety and wellbeing of our employees and their families around the world. In 2020, we adapted to a remote workforce, including by providing a stipend for employees to create work places at home, and resources for coping with the challenging times. We prioritized regular communication with employees in order to maintain a strong sense of community within the organization. We continued these measures in 2021, while also carefully opening some of our offices to provide employees with the option of working from an office if they so choose. We continue to monitor and follow local requirements with respect to safety measures in each office location.
