We aim to serve as a cultural and educational meeting point between China and the U.S. The Company intends to provide educational training courses and lectures based on classical Chinese studies, inviting Chinese and U.S. experts to give lectures both in Chinese and English in the U.S., organizing China-U.S. international study tour activities for participants of all ages, as well as organizing and promoting China-U.S. cultural events, art fairs, exhibitions, and other activities promoting Chinese culture.

Industry Background
 
Increasing Demand for Classical Chinese Studies Education in the U.S.
 
Since initiating market reforms in 1978, China’s economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. The economy in China has grown significantly over the past few decades. China’s overall economy and the average wage in China have increased in recent years and are expected to grow, which inspired a growing global interest in China, and a growing demand to learn more about the Chinese culture and language. Even Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, offered RMB 840,000 (approximately USD 125,000) to hire a Chinese speaking nanny for his daughter. Currently, there is a demand of Chinese education, both culturally and language-wise, of about 6 million people in the U. S.
 
The market for classical Chinese studies education and training in the U.S. exists, but is still in an early stage of development. We estimate that this industry presents huge training needs, substantial business opportunities, and considerable profit margins. It has already attracted a large number of institutions and organizations who participate in the market and promote the development of the industry.

Targeting Market for Classical Chinese Studies Education in the U.S. – The Chinese-American Demographic
 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 4.52 million Chinese people living in the U.S. in 2018. This makes Chinese people the largest Asia-Pacific ethnic group in the U.S., and the second largest ethnic group after the Mexicans, when considering all ethnic minorities as a whole. The US Department of Homeland Security lists Chinese immigrants as the third-largest immigrant group in the United States. There are 21 million Asia-Pacific Americans in the U.S., accounting for 6.7% of the total population. It is expected that by 2050 Asia-Pacific Americans will account for 10% of the total U.S. population.

Chinese people gather in certain parts of the U.S., mainly in California, New York, and other metropolitan cities. Half of all Chinese Americans live in the western part of the U.S. One fifth live in the northeast and south. In the west of the U.S. they concentrate in Seattle, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and other cities located in California; and in the south in cities located in Texas, such as Houston and Dallas. In the Northeast they concentrate in New York and Boston. New York City, with 570,000 Chinese, is a metropolis with a large Chinese population.
 
Most Chinese Americans are concentrated in California, with 36.9% of the total Chinese population, followed by New York, with 16.9%; New Jersey, with 4.4%; Texas, with 4.2%; and Florida, with 4.1%.
 
These 4.52 million Chinese-Americans, with a prior affinity to the Chinese identity and culture, will be our initial target audience. They are the driving force behind the American educational enterprises offering traditional Chinese culture immersion courses and services related to Chinese language and classical Chinese studies.
 
Challenges Faced by Institutions Offering Classical Chinese Studies Education in the U.S.
 
The classical Chinese studies education offered in the current U.S. market is in a state of chaotic development. This is mainly reflected by two key factors: (i) the design and planning of course content is disorganized; and (ii) teachers are poorly selected and trained. The combination of these two elements results in the fact that the concept of classical Chinese studies is not clearly defined.

i. | Course setting. Due to the lack of carefully planned course and content design, there is no consensus on the subject of what constitutes classical Chinese studies in the U.S. This causes institutions and universities to develop their own policies and their own interpretation when selecting the curriculum and content for their classical Chinese studies courses. There is no unified curriculum for classical Chinese studies in the U.S. today. Each learning center and university uses the resources available to them when structuring a course, some prioritize art over history and literature, while others do the opposite. They all emphasize their perceived strong subjects or where they have more available resources. 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii. | Teacher selection. The present market lacks teachers who are specialized or have the required skills, experience, and qualifications to teach a classical Chinese studies course. Some teachers who are not qualified to teach subjects related to classical Chinese studies are somehow teaching those courses. This lack of specialization and professionalism among the teachers themselves makes delivering a real classical Chinese studies course very difficult. Students, not knowing any better, blindly obey. 

Market Opportunity Analysis of Classical Chinese Studies Education in the U.S.
 
Currently, there are not many education service providers who offer classical Chinese studies operating in the U.S., and long-term operating experience in this field is non-existent. This may be because most of the educational institutions operating in the market pursue revenue and tend to ignore the needs of clients. Many Internet educators focus on profitability rather than education itself, and their lack of competitive teaching methods and content renders them unable to enter into an overseas market with a full-fledged array of different education offers like they can in the U.S.

Service providers offering classical Chinese studies education have two major functions: To teach American students Chinese and provide services so that some of those American students can study abroad in China, and to promote the excellence of Chinese culture as a whole. Some companies use their platform to provide American students with English-language versions of classical Chinese studies courses and Chinese language learning courses. They also invite experts in Chinese language and professors, scholars, and academics of classical Chinese studies to give lectures.

COMPANY OVERVIEW
 
GJ Culture Group US, Inc. (“GJ Culture”) is a Nevada corporation, dedicated to providing educational and other relating services based on classical Chinese studies and culture. We aim to serve as a cultural and educational meeting point between China and the U.S. We will pursue our business purpose by providing educational training courses and lectures based on classical Chinese studies, organizing China-U.S. international study tour activities for participants of all ages, and organizing and promoting China-U.S. cultural events, art fairs, exhibitions, etc. Our executive office is located in Danville, the State of California.
 
We will focus on education and the cultural exchange between China and the U.S., relying on our profound knowledge in the field of Chinese classical culture and art. We intend to capitalize on the growing interest in China and on its increasing global influence by offering accurate and systematized curriculum of classical Chinese studies, and contribute to the exchange and development of cultural education and art between China and the U.S.
 
OUR MISSION AND VISION
 
Committed to quality education service based on classical Chinese studies and culture
 
Generally speaking, classical Chinese studies mainly refer to an academic system which utilizes the study of Chinese classics to illustrate and convey the ethos, philosophy, character, and moral and social code of the Chinese nation. Classical Chinese studies are applied to guarantee the quality of education. It contributes to the development of intelligence in children, which requires the constant acquisition of knowledge, the enhancement of language through reading and speaking, and the cultivation of memory abilities. All of these qualities can be developed through Di Zi Gui, which offers the standards for being a good pupil and child, and the San Zi Jing (Three Character Classic) used to teach children Confucian values.
 
Adolescents have entered the stage of understanding the world and establishing their personalities, and need to be guided in words and deeds, as in this stage they have begun to learn through imitation. Therefore, in addition to words and deeds, they need to be given the proper resources to enable them to fully digest and understand their pre-memory knowledge. Adolescents learn to develop critical thinking and perception skills through classical Chinese poetry, painting, calligraphy, chess, and the Chinese Game of Go.
 
Adults have the richness of life experience behind them. Their life, work, and emotional spheres are more complex, so education at this stage of life is dedicated to reflection, experience, and contemplation. Studying the rich ideological and theoretical works of the Chinese classics will help adults think and act wisely and face with ease all difficulties that may present themselves in their life.
 
Committed to the dissemination of ancient Chinese philosophical ideas.
 
The development of a country cannot be separated from the proliferation of culture, which in turn cannot be separated from the inheritance and dissemination of the cultural traditions existing in the area. In fact, Chinese culture is both ancient and complex, in and of itself is an evidence of the continuing accumulation of knowledge through civilization. Chinese classical studies contain abundant ancient Chinese philosophy. It is not only the essence of classical Chinese culture, but also an important factor to maintain the sustainable development of contemporary China. We believe that Chinese culture and Chinese classical studies contribute not only to the sustained development and expansion of the Chinese people, but to the sustained development of the world as a whole. Our long-term objective is to introduce ancient Chinese philosophical ideas into collective consciousness.

Committed to become a bond between Chinese and western cultures and art.
 
GJ Culture will gradually expand its international study tour services, classical Chinese studies education services, seminars, cultural events, and art fairs by integrating and managing the valuable resources we have accumulated in the field of Chinese classical studies, culture, and art. Over the years we have gained knowledge, experience, and expertise in the fields of both Chinese and western culture and art. We anticipate that this knowledge will position us not only as an education service provider, but also as a platform for the exchange of culture and art between China and the U.S. We intend to serve as a melting pot for the continuous amalgamation of Chinese and American cultures.
 
OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
 
The contents of our seminars and teaching materials will be written and composed specifically for classical Chinese educational purposes.
 
The contents of our classical Chinese studies education curriculum will be designed based on the traditional Chinese classics. To develop the contents and systematize our course curriculum we have incorporated both Chinese and western education models, applying a directional development approach. Our system is different from other institutions in this industry that simply read the traditional classics and design courses according to the objective needs of classes and lectures. We will adapt Chinese classical cultural principles to storytelling to meet the dynamic needs of classroom lectures and will also use pictorial impressions to help students memorize and understand complex text descriptions.
 
We will divide our students according to their developmental stage and design each course accordingly. This will allow us to offer the rich and diverse content of classical Chinese studies and education services effectively and systematically. We have also planned to develop special teaching programs and assessment materials for teachers and tutors of classical Chinese studies.
 
Sophisticated classical Chinese studies education system and one-stop training system
 
Our classical Chinese studies education services include curriculum education, lectures, international study tours, and cultural and art exchanges. We believe our education services cover all aspects of classical Chinese culture. We have planned to specially develop phase-linked courses and teaching methods that correspond to the different stages of classical Chinese studies. These phase-linked courses and teaching methods guarantee that students learn classical Chinese studies systematically within a structured framework of education, which in turn encourages students to further their education by taking the advanced courses. Systematic learning and the possibility to advance their education increases student engagement. The variety of services we provide, such as classes, public lectures, international study tours, cultural events and art exhibitions, will provide our students with a first-hand, hands-on integral learning experience.

Scientific Theoretical System of Classical Studies Education
 
We have combined western psychology, neuroscience and Chinese classical studies to create a scientific theory of classical Chinese studies. Using the analogy of how a tree grows, we have taken classical studies as the soil, moral behavior as the root, thoughts as the stem, and the arts as the branches, emphasizing the idea of “infiltrating the soul and enlightening wisdom.” This idea is the basis of our approach. We aim to provide a systematic classical studies education process for our students of different ages. We have developed diversified services and products horizontally, these include lectures, classroom education, international study tour services and cultural and artistic events. All of our students can participate in these activities because vertically we have adopted the concept of multi-level and phased product development, so each product created horizontally is vertically adapted to cater to different needs according to different developmental stages.
Resources for Classical Studies Education
 
Education is a subject that requires professionalism, and classical Chinese studies education requires professional teachers who can convey its contents through a systematized and scientific approach. GJ Culture plans to collaborate with well-known masters in the field of Chinese culture and art and plans to establish solid cooperation relationships with some institutions of classical Chinese culture and art in China.
 
Our team and contributors provide professional classical studies education, culture and art courses to numerous Chinese-Americans, scholars and people interested in Chinese culture in general. We plan and co-ordinate our resources, and the resources of our contributors, to offer a diverse and systematic array of services related to Chinese classical studies, to cover the demand of the American market.
 
OUR GROWTH STRATEGIES
 
GJ Culture is committed to becoming a professional service institution in the field of education, specifically in classical Chinese studies, culture, and art. Classical studies and art are at the core of our services. We will offer international study tours, classical Chinese studies seminars and lectures, and cultural and artistic events, all of which will enrich, elevate and complement each other, forming a vertically integrated offer of products and services with great potential for growth.
 
We aspire to become a pre-eminent education service provider for classical Chinese culture study and intend to pursue the following strategies to further grow our business:
 
Enhance education quality and academic results
 
We place great emphasis on enhancing our education quality. We offer one of the most comprehensive classical Chinese culture studies, and plan to further enhance the breadth and depth of our course offerings to enrich our students’ learning experience. We will also continue to devote resources to recruit experienced teachers, enhance ongoing teachers’ training programs through collaboration with other education institutions, and develop proprietary teaching materials.

Promote brand awareness
 
We believe that our education quality speaks volumes for our brand. Word-of-mouth referrals by former and current students and their families have been an important source of student enrollment. We will continue to drive word-of-mouth marketing by focusing on improving our education quality and students’ academic achievements while leveraging social media to improve the efficiency of our brand building and marketing initiatives.
 
In addition, we plan to organize more event-driven marketing campaigns to further increase our influence in the industry and among parents, such as seminars for prospective students, international education conferences and formation of strategic partnerships with international education institutions.
 
Expand into new markets across the U.S.
 
We will continue to expand our course network into other regions in the United States to capture nationwide demand for quality classical Chinese culture education. We intend to continue to replicate our success and apply our experience and know-how from the operation of our mature facilities to new facilities and promote the sharing of teaching and administrative resources within our network.
 
Increase utilization rate and improve operating efficiency
 
We seek to increase our student enrollment and program utilization rate, especially for our programs that are at the ramp-up stage, through marketing efforts and dedicated student recruiting teams. A larger student base allows more efficient utilization of our infrastructure and resources and improves our operating efficiency and profitability. We will continue to standardize operation of our programs in areas such as curriculum design, teaching resource allocation, cost control, auxiliary facilities, and service management. This will also allow for better resource sharing within our network to achieve greater economies of scale. We will also provide training to our management and administrative staff to ensure proper implementation of our standardized best practices.
 
Pursue strategic alliances and selective acquisition opportunities
 
We intend to continue to form strategic partnerships with reputable education institutions and make selective strategic alliances with and acquisitions of complementary businesses to further improve our education quality, expand our student base and network, and diversify our service offerings.
 
We are actively exploring potential joint venture opportunities with reputable overseas operators of classical Chinese culture institutes to further expand our program network. We seek to invest in or acquire companies that are complementary to our business, including institutions providing education and trading courses based on classical Chinese studies. We seek to increase our cooperation with organizations, especially those specializing in organizing China-U.S. international study tour activities for participants of all ages and organizing and promoting China-U.S. cultural events and art fairs and exhibitions, to further enhance and enrich our students’ learning experience and results. A minority shareholder of GJ Culture Group US, Inc. is a majority shareholder of Shaanxi Guojiang Cultural Industry Group Co., Ltd. (“Guojiang China”), an affiliated company. We may intend to combine Guojiang China and Guojiang US in the future, but there is no definitive and binding agreement entered into as of today.

CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT
 
Definition of Chinese Classical Studies Education
 
Chinese classical studies refer to the chief educational institutions established and operated by the imperial courts of ancient China, such as the imperial colleges of “Guo Zi Jian” or “Tai Xue.” In the early 20th century, the terms classical studies and Chinese classical academy became synonymous. Classical studies are a universe of content that revolve around the teachings of the Chinese classical and ancient culture. It studies and interprets Chinese classical culture and academia with Confucianism as basis. There are two levels of classical studies. In the broad sense, classical studies are what Hu Shi calls “all the past cultural history of China”, including literature, history, religion, art, mathematics, etc. In a narrow sense, classical studies refer to the classical Chinese ideology and culture. In short, classical studies education is the education of Chinese classical culture. It has two goals: (i) to enrich the training system and quality of modern education by infusing it with the excellence of ancient Chinese culture; and (ii) to absorb a deep understanding of the philosophical ideas that permeate ancient Chinese culture.
Classification of Classical Studies
 
One classification method of classical studies is the classification method of “Siku Quanshu,” which classifies classical studies into four sections: Jing, Shi, Zi and Ji.
 
“Jing” (Classics) refers to ancient books, such as the Classic of Changes, the Classic of Poetry, the Classic of Filial Piety, the Analects of Confucius, the Mencius, etc. Some works on language exegetics, such as the Erya, were included later.
 
“Shi” (Histories) refers to historical works, including general history, such as Sima Qian’s Records of the Grand Historian and Zheng Qiao’s Tongzhi; dynastic history in Ban Gu’s Book of Han, Chen Shou’s Records of the Three Kingdoms, and Ouyang Xiu’s New History of the Five Dynasties; political history, in the Sima Guang’s Zizhi Tongjian, and Li Tao’s Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian; and a detailed history of institutions and cultural relics, classics, and texts, in Du You’s Tongdian andMa Duanlin’s Wenxian Tongkao and other chronicles of the region.
 
“Zi” (Masters) refers to the collection of works of people who created a theory or school during the course of Chinese history, which incluedes Xunzi of Confucianism, Han Feizi and the Book of Lord Shang of Legalists, Sun Tzu of Military Strategists, Lao Tzu and Zhuangzi of Taoists, as well as books on Buddhism, the life of peasants, manuals for doctors, astronomical algorithms, mathematics, arts, genealogy, miscellaneous writers, and novelists, all of which belong to the section of Zi.
 

12
--


“Ji” (Collections) include a collection of intellectuals and scholars and individual collections in history. Collections of individuals are called “Bie Ji”, these include Li Taibai Ji, Du Gongbu Ji, Wang Jinggong Ji, etc. General collections include Zhaoming Wenxuan, Wenyuan Yinghua, Yutai Xinyong, etc. Some ancient opera works, not included in Siku, such as Changshengdian, Xixiangji and Peony Pavilion, are part of Ji.
 
The other method classifies classical studies according to their content attributes in three categories: the study of Neo-Confucianism, the study of textual research and the study of poetry and prose.
 
The purpose of the study of Neo-Confucianism is to discover the underlying truth of all things, its essence is philosophical. The study of textual research is to engage in historical research, that is, historiography. The study of poetry and prose is literature, and its purpose is to engage in the creation of practical literary styles such as poetry, prose, reports, memorials to emperors and judgments. Later, the study of country management, i.e. politics, economics, law and other social sciences for governance were included; as well as the study of science and technology, i.e. acoustics, optics, chemistry, electrics and other natural sciences.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS
 
The research and development our services and products mainly include: (i) project development of our international study tours; (ii) the content design of our lectures on classical Chinese studies; (iii) the curriculum development of our classical Chinese studies courses; and (iv) the organizations and promotion of cultural events and art exhibitions.
 
The research and development of the international study tours we will provide include the design of the tour routes, content modules, travel activities, safety plans, etc. The research and development of our classical Chinese studies lectures, and classical Chinese studies courses includes the curriculum of contents, teaching materials, audio and audio-visual resources, teaching plans and references, courseware tools, teaching methods, assessment standards, etc. The planning content of cultural events and art exhibitions mainly includes the design of themes, activity scenarios, activity flows, activity promotion schemes, etc.
 
The Company plans to cooperate with experts or scholars who are interested in and have a thorough study of classical Chinese culture, or form the Chinese culture or study center of major Chinese and American universities, or from some Chinese and American non-government institutions which engage in classical Chinese culture and studies, for the research and development of educational products. By combining education and research, we intend to improve the level and efficiency of our research and development process and lay a solid foundation for the sustainable development of the educational services we offer. Our R&D will use market research and competitive analysis to determine which product and/or service to develop, it will complete a description of such product and/or service, deconstruct the project design structure, implement the sub-module product or service according to the results of the deconstruction, and then integrate the sub-module, to finally integrate the products and services. After the initial market validation, such products and services will be revised based on the feedback received from students and participants, and then the comprehensive marketing work to promote such products and services will begin.

Lectures on Classical Studies
 
Classical Chinese studies involve the classical Chinese academy, which includes philosophy, Confucian classics, literature, history, politics, military science, natural science, theology, art, etc. All of these contents taken as a whole constitute the essence of classical Chinese studies. Classical studies are based on the Chinese classics of the pre-Qin Dynasty, around 2000 years ago, and on the theories of various masters. Classical Chinese studies cover a complete set of unique cultural and academic systems, such as Confucianism of the Han Dynasty, Metaphysics of the Wei and Jin Dynasties, Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming Dynasties, Poetry of the Han Dynasty, Parallel prose of the Six Dynasties, Poetry of the Tang and Song Dynasties, Operas of the Yuan Dynasty, novels of the Ming and Qing Dynasty, and etc. Classical Chinese studies represent the richness of Chinese culture covering thousands of years and contain the wisdom and essence of China’s 5,000-year history. Nowadays, China’s growth and development have caused a surge of interest in all things Chinese. More people are interested in studying and understanding China’s history, culture, and ethos. We will capitalize on this growing interest by offering “Lectures on Chinese Classical Studies” bringing the core values of Chinese culture to those who have an interest in learning.

As the name implies, classical Chinese studies are the study of Chinese history and tradition, which has been around for 5,000 years. In the wave of economic globalization, classical Chinese studies have attracted the attention of people around the world, gradually becoming a popular trend of intercultural studies. We believe there is a good business opportunity in offering classical Chinese studies courses and education. We believe its contents will help enrich people’s spiritual life. There is a global interest in learning about Chinese culture, and a growing desire to take classes on the subject. However, the institutions offering classic Chinese studies in the U.S. at the moment offer neither a systematic concept of classical studies education nor a professional approach to teaching. With this in mind, and in order to structure different programs according to the different stages of cognitive development, we have developed junior or beginner classes of classical studies for young people, a middle-level version course for classical Chinese culture enthusiasts, and premium classes for professionals and corporate executives.

OUR BRANDING AND MARKETING
 
We have established a clear target audience and market objectives and have structured on marketing plan and determined a detailed marketing strategy with the objective of achieving reaching our target audience.

● | Market Agent 
--+-----------------

 
Our goal is to become the leading service provider of classical Chinese education, with emphasis in the field of art and culture. In the next five years, we will focus our business in the U.S. and China. Our chief executive office is currently located in Danville, California. From there we intend to expand our business ventures, initially within the state of California and then to the rest of America.
 

● | Product Distribution 
--+-------------------------

 
Our product and service distribution strategies will emphasize our achievements with respect to the professionalization and the systematization of knowledge and content of classical Chinese cultural and artistic studies. Because the content of classical Chinese education and culture are rather complex, they present multiple possibilities when combining content in the process of product development. Students of different age groups and backgrounds have different preferences. In order to satisfy the diverse demands of our customers, we intend to adjust and optimize our products and services from time to time, and to provide tailored services to meet the requirements of our customers. We will develop products and services based on Chinese education, culture, and art in accordance with the needs of our customers. We will prioritize the systematization of content, the creation of different product categories, and the professionalization of our teaching methods when designing our product and service distribution strategy.

● | Marketing Geographic Area 
--+------------------------------

 
We will initially operate in San Francisco Bay Area, and expand our business throughout the state of California and into the rest of America in stages as follows:
 
Stage 1: Central Market - San Francisco and the Bay Area
 
Our executive office is located in Danville, San Francisco Bay Area, California. Around 20% of the 800,000 people residing in San Francisco Bay Area are Chinese or of Chinese descent. San Francisco is one of the cities with the highest density of residents with Chinese heritage. San Francisco has a large district called “Chinatown” which has played a significant role in the political, economic, and social aspects of life in the California region. Therefore, we believe that the San Francisco Bay Area will provide us with a natural market advantage in the field of Chinese education, justifying our choice of San Francisco Bay Area as an entry point for the exploration of the U.S. market.
Stage 2: Regional Market – California
 
Expanding from the market in San Francisco, we will focus on the rest of the state of California. As the market area grows, team-building and marketing efforts will be strengthened. The state of California presents a strong market due to its large Sino-Asian population base. The state also has the largest number of Chinese students studying abroad in the U.S. The total number of international students in California is about 135,130, with 33.6% being Chinese.
Stage 3: Comprehensive Market - the United States
 
When the Company obtains strong operational capabilities and enters the stage of rapid development, it will gradually expand its target market to cover to the whole U.S. With the continuous improvement of our service capabilities and the continuous development of our business, we will strive to establish branches in key markets and metropolitan areas in the U.S.

● | Marketing Strategies 
--+-------------------------

 
In terms of marketing strategies, the company will focus on cultural activities and supplement those with advertising and promotion. Marketing will be carried out in three stages.
 
Stage 1: Market penetration.
 
To penetrate the market we will advertise in paper publications, such as local newspapers and magazines. We will strive to convey the Company’s name, products, and brand to our target audience through the media and radio. Specific concepts and images will be incorporated into these communication strategies.
 
In addition, promotional materials such as leaflets, posters, and gifts will be delivered on a regular basis to our target audience. Marketing personnel will distribute these materials in crowded places to achieve the desired market outreach. Additionally, we will set up fixed help desks near schools and in places where our target audience concentrates. We will seek to connect with museums and cultural venues in general to discuss mutual cooperation and brand promotion.

Stage 2: Media Marketing
 
Once we start generating profits we will consider including advertising through television, the internet, and other media. In addition to strong a media presence, we also intend to organize conferences, classical cultural exchange meetings, cultural and artistic exchanges, and three-dimensional art exhibitions, all of which will help to represent and promote our brand. With this approach to marketing we intend to establish an attractive corporate image and increase the Company’s visibility. We plan to conduct regular exchanges with local schools, offering free course trials to students to encourage them to experience classical Chinese studies. We expect to build a good reputation and corporate image through the word-of-mouth.
Stage 3: Seminar Marketing
 
When the company’s development becomes stable and has a certain influence in the industry, we plan to host classical Chinese culture seminars regularly, inviting Chinese scholars, Chinese cultural enthusiasts or other Chinese education institutions to send representatives to conduct classical studies exchanges. These seminars will be held on a regular basis. We intend to scale and expand these events to become the most influential Chinese school exchange event in the United States.
COMPETITION
 
Competition Analysis of Classical Studies Education Market in the U.S.
 
American colleges and universities, for the purpose of cooperation, connect Chinese and American educational enterprises. The collaboration between the two includes exchanging classrooms, language training, high-end applications for studying abroad, homework counseling and career guidance services. After cooperating, the parties mainly provide services to Chinese students studying in America. American enterprises provide various services for students interested in studying abroad through the integration of regional platforms.
 
On the one hand, Chinese classical studies education enterprises provide language training and preparation for the entrance exams required for foreign students interested in studying in the U.S. On the other hand, they also provide an English version of the preparation of entrance exams and an English version of classical Chinese culture courses for native American students in the U.S. In addition to basic learning courses, Chinese classical studies education enterprises have also launched internships and employment guidance courses for foreign students and pre-employment guidance services for graduates returning home.
 
Trend of Classical Studies Education in the U.S.
 
The American education industry operates in a large market. The major classical studies education enterprises in the U.S. are just recently starting to pay attention to the application of scientific and technological methods to teaching, barely grasping the industry trends and level of competition. Many major classical studies education enterprises in the U.S. prefer to develop their business through distance-learning and through cooperation with Chinese classical studies education companies, having their content developed by Chinese companies, and a sales and promotion department in America.
 
Analysis of Information Trend Development of Classical Studies Education
 
In the social media era, the dissemination of new media through computers and mobile phones has proved convenient for the development of classical Chinese studies education. Firstly, American classical studies enterprises can now set up a column for “Classical Studies” on their platforms and select several teachers with profound knowledge of classical Chinese culture to teach and manage course online. Fast, open and interactive online communication channels between teachers and students contribute to learning. Secondly, the opening of online courses is an effective way of promotion. We will engage experienced and successful online course designers to design and operate online courses related to classical studies. Thirdly, we may take advantage of the opportunity to organize online classical Chinese culture competitions for promotional purposes.

Chart: Value Chain of Educational Informatization
 

EMPLOYEES
 
At the date hereof, we do not have any full time employees but we plan to hire employees in the foreseeable future as our business grows.
 
We have entered into a Business Collaboration Agreement with BEEC Inc, a Nevada corporation, whereby they will serve as our agents for the purpose of selling and promoting our products and services.

REGULATIONS
 
Effect of Existing or Probable U.S. Government Regulations on the Business
 
Generally, we intend to provide non-certified educational services without the issuance of a degree. Providers of such educational services are generally not required to be licensed under applicable state laws. For example, the New York Education Law exempts from its licensing provisions schools that provide instruction in only the following subjects: religion, dancing, 38 music, painting, drawing, sculpture, poetry, dramatic art, languages, reading comprehension, mathematics, recreation, yoga, martial arts, pilates and athletics. In California, another state we intend to provide services, the California Education Code and the California Code of Regulations, Title 5, Education apply uniquely to K-12 public schools, special education services and ancillary topics concerning the former, including teacher credentialing. We believe that the other states in which we intend to operate provide similar exemptions from licensure.
 
We are subject to laws, rules or regulations of general applicability, including laws respecting labor, work safety and health. To date, these laws have not had a material adverse effect on our operations. While our business operations have not been materially adversely affected by regulation, we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected in the future nor can we predict the effect of any future legislation or regulation.
