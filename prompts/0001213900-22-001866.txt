ITEM 1. BUSINESS



The discussion of the business of Genufood Energy Enzymes Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiary (“Genufood” or the “Company”), is as of the date of filing this report, unless otherwise indicated.



Original Business



During our historic period, we were a start-up company whose main focus was to promote, market, distribute and export a range of enzyme products manufactured in the United States for sale for human and animal consumption in certain Asian markets, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (“ASEAN”). Our objective was to commence marketing and distribution of a range of enzyme products for human and animal consumption to sole country distributors, wholesalers, dealers and retailers, as well as to the general public following a Multi-Level Marketing – Franchise Investor Dealer Related (MLM-FIDR) concept, beginning in Taiwan, and then China, Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka.



At some point, which we believe may have occurred approximately mid- to late-2016, Oliver Lin’s management ceased operating our original business. We have not generated any revenue from operations since that time.



Recent Developments



In 2019 and through the end of fiscal 2021, we explored plans to restart our enzyme products business or develop a new business. In 2019 and through early 2020, we had planned to restart our original enzyme products business, by importing enzyme supplements from the United States for sale in Taiwan. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all non-COVID-19 related matters, including obtaining an import license from Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), were delayed or were taking longer than usual in Taiwan beginning in late-January 2020. For various reasons, including the fact that, without a reasonably foreseeable end of the pandemic and Taiwan government resources being shifted to dealing with the pandemic, we decided to abandon the plan to restart our enzyme products business.



During fiscal year 2020, we announced that we were in the preliminary stage of developing a new business plan to sell and distribute physiological sea water and nasal spray in Taiwan and the United States. However, after exploring this possible business as a result of several factors, including but not limited to difficulties in commencing a new business during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we decided not to pursue the nasal spray business.



In September 2020, we announced that we were exploring business opportunities for medical mask, medical-grade gloves and possibly other PPE. During fiscal 2021, due to lack of sufficient funding, we decided not to pursue the PPE business. We continued to explore other products with high demand since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically rapid test kits. However, due to lack of funding and other factors, including the size of enterprise needed to successfully carry out such a business, we no longer intend to pursue this business.



At this time, we have no specific plan to commence any particular new business. Our focus will be to consider either or both of a possible business combination, which may include but not be limited to a reverse merger, with another operating business, or commencing a business of our own. However, we reserve the right to further change our business plan at any time.



Hukui Investment



In late September 2020, we announced that Hukui Biotechnology Corporation (“Hukui”) and we had entered into a Series C Preferred Shares Subscription Agreement dated September 23, 2020 (the “Hukui Agreement”), pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase an aggregate 200,000 shares of Hukui’s Series C Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred Shares”) at $10.00 per share, for an aggregate investment of $2,000,000. 



The Hukui Agreement provided that we would purchase the Series C Preferred Shares in three tranches, through a date on or before June 30, 2022, as follows:




● | The first tranche is 80,000 Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of $800,000 (the “First Tranche Investment”), such shares having been purchased by us on December 15, 2020 (the “First Tranche Closing”); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The second tranche is 60,000 Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of $600,000 (the “Second Tranche Investment”), such shares having been purchased by us on June 25, 2021 (the “Second Tranche Closing”); and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The third tranche is 60,000 Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of $600,000 (the “Third Tranche Investment”), such shares to have been purchased on or before June 30, 2022 (the “Third Tranche Closing”). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Following the end of our 2021 fiscal year, an individual and resident of the Republic of China (the “Purchaser”), Hukui and we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of November 17, 2021 (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which we agreed to sell the 140,000 shares of Hukui’s Series C Preferred Stock that we had purchased in the First Tranche Closing and the Second Tranche Closing (the “Hukui Shares”) to the Purchaser for $350,000 in cash, or $2.50 per share. The sale of the Hukui Shares closed on November 19, 2021.

As a result of our original purchase of the first 80,000 of the Hukui Shares on December 15, 2020, together with certain other factors, we may have been deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). To the extent that we may have been deemed to be an investment company, we have been relying on Rule 3a-2 promulgated under the Investment Company Act, allowing us to terminate our investment company status on or before December 15, 2021, the first anniversary of our purchase of the first 80,000 of the Hukui Shares, without having to register and be regulated as an investment company.



Believing that it is not in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to register and be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we explored different lawful means by which we could terminate our potential investment company status. We determined that the only viable option to terminate our potential investment company status and lawfully avoid registration and regulation under the Investment Company Act was to sell the Hukui Shares on or before the December 15, 2021 deadline.



After making diligent efforts to seek a purchaser of the Hukui Shares, we received three all-cash offers to purchase the Hukui Shares. We accepted the offer of the Purchaser, which was the highest of the three all-cash offers that we received.



We had purchased the Hukui Shares in two tranches, on December 15, 2020 and June 30, 2021, pursuant to the Hukui Agreement, at $10.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1,400,000.  We sold the Hukui Shares at $2.50 per share, for a total price of $350,000, resulting in loss of $1,050,000. We recognized impairment loss of the market value of the shares of $1,050,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



On December 17, 2021, Hukui and we entered into an Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which our obligation to make the Third Tranche Investment was terminated and the Hukui Agreement was terminated. As a result, we have no continuing contractual obligation to make any investment in Hukui. 



With the sale of the Hukui Shares, we believe that we are no longer deemed to be an investment company as defined in the Investment Company Act and, accordingly, we are not required to register and be regulated as an investment company thereunder. Additionally, with the execution of the Termination Agreement, the possibility that we could again become an inadvertent investment company under the Investment Company Act has been removed.



If we decide to develop a plan of operations for a new business, we will need to raise capital to pursue such a business. There are no commitments in place to fund any such business and no guarantee can be given that we will be able to secure such funding on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.



Either alone, or in combination with a plan of operations for a business that we would operate, we will also consider opportunities to engage in a reverse merger with another company.



Certain Regulatory Matters



Blank Check Company 



Based on the current and proposed business activities described above, the Company is a “blank check” company pursuant to Rule 419(a)(2) under the Securities Act. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) defines a blank check company as “any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3 (a)(51) of the Exchange Act, and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.” 



Rule 419 requires, among other things, that the proceeds of any public offering of penny stock securities by a blank check company, and all securities issued by a blank check company in such an offering, must be placed in a formal escrow or trust account until certain conditions specified in Rule 419 have been satisfied. In addition, many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions.



Shell Company 



Pursuant to Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, we are also a “shell company” because we have no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. As such, we are subject to a variety of regulations. As we have also previously disclosed, certain specific rules and regulations of the SEC apply to shell companies, including the following:

● | Shell companies may not register securities in connection with an employee benefit plan while they are a shell company and for 60 days after reporting certain current public information to the SEC regarding transactions or events resulting in the termination of shell company status. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stockholders of shell companies may not rely on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144, until the following primary requirements have been satisfied: (i) one year has elapsed since the company ceases to be a shell company and certain current information has been timely filed with the SEC regarding the cessation of the company’s status as a shell company; (ii) the company is subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act; and (iii) the company has been current in all of its periodic SEC filings for the 12 months preceding the contemplated sale of stock.

● | Reporting shell companies are required to disclose transactions and events that result in a shell company ceasing to be a shell company. Such disclosure is typically made on a Current Report on Form 8-K, which requires extensive information about the transactions and events in issue.
