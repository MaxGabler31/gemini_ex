The Chemours Company
 
Corporate History
 We began operating as an independent company on July 1, 2015 (Separation Date) after separating from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont) (Separation). Effective prior to the opening of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on the Separation Date, DuPont completed the Separation of the businesses comprising its Performance Chemicals reporting segment, and certain other assets and liabilities, into us, a separate and distinct public company. The Separation was completed by way of a distribution of all of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock through a dividend-in-kind of our common stock (par value $0.01) to holders of DuPont’s common stock (par value $0.30) as of the close of business on June 23, 2015 (Record Date).
 On the Separation Date, each holder of DuPont’s common stock received one share of our common stock for every five shares of DuPont’s common stock held on the Record Date. The Separation was completed pursuant to a separation agreement and other agreements with DuPont, including an employee matters agreement, a tax matters agreement, a transition services agreement, and an intellectual property cross-license agreement. These agreements govern the relationship between us and DuPont following the Separation and provided for the allocation of various assets, liabilities, rights, and obligations at the Separation Date. These agreements also included arrangements for transition services provided to us by DuPont, which were substantially completed during 2016.
 Our Five-Point Transformation Plan
 Following the Separation, we developed a five-point transformation plan to address changes to our organization, cost structure, and portfolio of businesses. We made considerable progress on our transformation plan from August 2015 through December 2017 and declared the transformation plan complete at the end of 2017.
 The objectives of our multi-year, five-point transformation plan were to improve our financial performance, streamline and strengthen our portfolio, and reduce our leverage by:
  
(i) | reducing our costs through a simpler business model;
----+-----------------------------------------------------


(ii) | optimizing our portfolio to focus on businesses where we have leading positions;
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | growing our market positions where we have competitive advantages;
------+-------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | refocusing our investments by concentrating our capital expenditures on our core businesses; and,
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(v) | enhancing our organization to deliver our values and support our transformation to a higher value chemistry company.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Through our cost reduction and growth initiatives, as well as improved market conditions, we delivered over $800 million of incremental adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) improvement over 2015 through 2017. Through year-end 2017, we realized approximately $350 million in cost savings since the Separation, which improved our pre-tax earnings by similar amounts. We continue to implement additional cost reduction initiatives in order to realize additional structural cost savings through 2018 and beyond. These improvements were realized after offsets related to the impact of divestitures completed during 2016, unfavorable price and mix of other products, and may also be impacted by market factors and other costs to achieve our plan. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had pre-tax income and Adjusted EBITDA of $912 million and $1.4 billion, respectively, compared with a pre-tax loss and Adjusted EBITDA of $11 million and $822 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, and a pre-tax loss and Adjusted EBITDA of $188 million and $573 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Through a combination of higher cash flows from operations and proceeds from asset sales, we reduced our leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of our net debt, or debt less cash and cash equivalents, to Adjusted EBITDA) to below 2.0 times at the end of 2017. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (U.S.) (i.e., it is a non-GAAP financial measure). For further discussion regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to their closest GAAP financial measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 Growth Expectations Through 2020
 On December 1, 2017, we held our first investor day, during which we described how we expect each of our businesses to contribute to our overall growth. For our Titanium Technologies segment, we are implementing a value stabilization strategy in order to seek to reduce volatility for our Ti-PureTM TiO2 pigment earnings. For our Fluoroproducts segment, we are optimizing our fluorochemicals product mix with the expansion of OpteonTM refrigerants capacity and renewing our fluoropolymers portfolio through application development. For our Chemical Solutions segment, we are expanding our capacity to meet demand for our Mining Solutions products. To the extent we are successful in implementing such plans, as to which no assurance can be made, we aim to meet key financial targets through 2020, including goals for our future net sales growth, Adjusted EBITDA margin improvement, adjusted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS), Free Cash Flows (FCF), and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).

The Chemours Company
 
Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, FCF, and ROIC are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Net Income is defined as our net income, adjusted for items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, except interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and certain provision for (benefit from) income tax amounts. Adjusted EPS is presented on a diluted basis and is calculated by dividing our Adjusted Net Income by the weighted-average number of our common shares outstanding, accounting for the dilutive impact of our stock-based compensation awards. FCF is defined as our cash flows provided by operating activities, less purchases of property, plant, and equipment as shown in our consolidated statements of cash flows. ROIC is defined as Adjusted EBITDA, less depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBIT), divided by the average of our invested capital, which amounts to our net debt plus equity. For further discussion regarding the risks associated with our failure to meet these key financial targets for 2020, see Item 1A – Risk Factors. For further discussion regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to their closest GAAP financial measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
Segments
 In our Titanium Technologies segment, we have a long-standing history of delivering high quality TiO2 pigment using our proprietary chloride technology. We are one of the largest global producers of TiO2, and our low cost network of manufacturing facilities allows us to efficiently and cost-effectively serve our global customer base. During 2016, we further enhanced our operating cost advantage with the startup of a second production line at our Altamira, Mexico facility. We believe we are well-positioned to remain one of the lowest cost TiO2 producers and continue to meet our customers’ growing needs around the world.
 In our Fluoroproducts segment, we are one of two globally-integrated producers making both fluorochemicals and fluoropolymers. In our fluorochemicals business, we expect to see increased adoption of Opteon™, one of the world’s lowest global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants, as governments around the world pass legislation that makes the use of low GWP refrigerants a requirement. Our fluoropolymers offerings provide customers with tailored products that have unique properties, including very high temperature resistance and high chemical resistance. We will continue to invest in research and development (R&D) to remain a leader in these areas and ensure that we are able to meet our customers’ needs as regulations change.
 In our Chemical Solutions segment, we completed a strategic review of our portfolio in 2016, which included the announced sales of our aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas, our Clean & Disinfect (C&D) business, and our Sulfur products business, as well as ceasing production at our Reactive Metals Solutions (RMS) facility in Niagara Falls, New York. We remain committed to retaining and improving our Mining Solutions business (previously known as our Cyanides business) and the product lines at our Belle, West Virginia site. As the largest global producer of solid sodium cyanide, our Mining Solutions business is recognized for our quality product offering, reliability of supply, and commitment to the safe production, storage, and use of our products. Global demand growth over the next three years is expected to remain healthy, driven by growth in gold ore processing volumes, and use as an intermediate in the synthesis of other chemicals (primarily in China). In the Americas region, the demand for sodium cyanide is expected to far exceed global demand growth rates, and as a result, we are currently building a new manufacturing facility in Mexico using a proprietary manufacturing technology that is inherently easier and safer to use. This new facility is expected to increase our sodium cyanide supply by approximately 50%, and it is expected to be completed in 2018.
 We will maintain our commitment to responsible stewardship and safety for our employees, customers, and the communities where we operate. Meeting and exceeding our customers’ expectations while conducting business in accordance with our high ethical standards will continue to be a primary focus for us as we continue to transform into a higher value chemistry company.
 Additional information on our segments can be found in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 25 – Geographic and Segment Information” within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Titanium Technologies Segment 
 Segment Overview
 Our Titanium Technologies segment is a leading, global manufacturer of TiO2. TiO2 pigment is used to deliver whiteness, opacity, brightness, and ultra-violet light protection in applications such as architectural and industrial coatings, flexible and rigid plastic packaging, polyvinylchloride (PVC) window profiles, laminate papers used for furniture and building materials, coated paper, and coated paperboard used for packaging. We sell our TiO2 pigment under the Ti-Pure™ brand name to approximately 700 customers globally. We also sell a chloride-based TiO2 pigment under the BaiMaxTM brand name, which is exclusively produced for customers in Greater China. We operate four TiO2 production facilities: two in the U.S., one in Mexico, and one in Taiwan. In addition, we have a large-scale repackaging and distribution facility in Belgium and operate a mineral sands mining operation in Starke, Florida. In total, we have a TiO2 pigment capacity of approximately 1.25 million metric tons per year. We expanded our TiO2 production facility in Altamira, Mexico in 2016, and by late 2017, we demonstrated full production capacity.

The Chemours Company
 
We are one of a limited number of producers operating a chloride process for the production of TiO2 pigment. We believe that our proprietary chloride technology enables us to operate plants at a much higher capacity than other chloride technology-based TiO2 producers, as we uniquely utilize a broad spectrum of titanium-bearing ore feedstocks to achieve the highest TiO2 pigment unit margins in our industry. This technology, which is in use at all of our production facilities, provides us with one of the industry’s lowest manufacturing cost positions. Our R&D efforts focus on improving production processes and developing TiO2 pigment grades that help our customers achieve optimal cost and product performance to enhance end-user total value.
 The overall demand for TiO2 pigment is highly correlated to growth in the global residential housing, commercial construction, and packaging markets. In the long-run, industry demand for TiO2 pigment is generally expected to be in line with global gross domestic product (GDP) growth. In 2017, demand growth for Ti-PureTM was above global GDP due to increased preference for high quality Ti-PureTM offerings, as well as global supply and demand dynamics. Longer-term, we expect global TiO2 pigment demand growth to correlate to global GDP growth rates. Our future Ti-PureTM demand growth may be below average global GDP growth rates if our sales into developed markets outpace our sales into emerging markets.
 Our Titanium Technologies segment net sales by region and end-market for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 are set forth in the following charts.

We sell over 20 different grades of TiO2 pigment, with each grade tailored for targeted applications. Our portfolio of premium performance TiO2 pigment grades provides end-users with benefits beyond opacity, such as longer-lasting performance, brighter colors, and the brilliant whites achievable only through chloride-manufactured pigment.

The Chemours Company
 
We have operated a titanium mine in Starke, Florida since 1949. The mine provides us with access to a low cost source of domestic, high quality ilmenite ore feedstock and supplies less than 10% of our ore feedstock consumption needs. Co-products of our mining operations, which comprised less than 5% of our total sales in Titanium Technologies in 2017, are zircon (zirconium silicate) and staurolite minerals. We are a major supplier of high quality calcined zircon in North America, primarily focused on the precision investment casting industry, foundry, specialty applications, and ceramics. Our staurolite blasting abrasives are used in steel preparation and maintenance and paint removal.
 Following the 2008 global financial crisis, the TiO2 pigment market saw a significant swing in average price from 2010 through 2015. As demand fell sharply during the global financial crisis, some high cost sites were shut down, shrinking overall industry capacity. This was followed by a strong surge in demand from 2010 through 2012, which brought on large price increases over a very short period. Soon thereafter, from 2012 through 2016, an influx of new capacity came online, driving TiO2 pigment prices down sharply. Since 2016, we have been working with our customers to price for the intrinsic value of Ti-PureTM to the end-user. We believe that volatility in both price and supply availability are significant concerns for producers and consumers throughout the value chain, and that a more stable price and supply trajectory for Ti-PureTM will enable our customers to focus on their downstream customer needs and enhance confidence in the long-term stability of the Ti-PureTM supply base.
 Industry Overview and Competitors
 We estimate that the worldwide demand for TiO2 in 2017 was approximately 6.1 million metric tons, of which, 60% was for premium performance pigments. Worldwide capacity in 2017 was estimated to be approximately 7.3 million metric tons. The products manufactured on this global capacity base are not fully substitutable due to pigment quality consistency and pigment product design. We believe that the utilization of the premium performance manufacturing base is considerably higher than that for general purpose, lower performance production. Over the next few years, we are planning to incrementally increase our production capacity by approximately 10% through technology-enabled de-bottlenecking processes. We believe that unlocking this additional 10% of capacity is in line with the anticipated needs of our customers during this time. This new capacity will effectively provide the equivalent of a new production line, while requiring a fraction of the capital investment. Our increased production capacity is also expected to be supported with investments to extend our ilmenite mine and through long-term work contracts with our suppliers.
 Competition in the TiO2 pigment market is based primarily on product performance (both product design and quality consistency), supply capability, and technical service. Our major competitors within higher performance pigments include: The National Titanium Dioxide Company, Ltd., or Cristal, Venator Material plc, Kronos Worldwide, Inc., and Tronox Limited.
 Beyond multi-national suppliers, the only other large producer is the Chinese producer, the Lomon-Billions Group. The other TiO2 pigment producers are fragmented, mostly utilizing the sulfate production process, and competing in the general purpose, lower performance pigment market. Within China, over the next few years, we believe that the announced added effective capacity is expected to be somewhat offset by capacity shutdowns at marginal producers. 
 Raw Materials
 The primary raw materials used in the manufacture of TiO2 are titanium-bearing ores, chlorine, calcined petroleum coke, and energy. We source titanium-bearing ores from a number of suppliers around the globe, who are primarily located in Australia and Africa. Our titanium mine in Starke, Florida supplies less than 10% of our raw materials needs. To ensure proper supply volume and to minimize pricing volatility, we generally enter into contracts in which volume is requirement-based and pricing is determined by a range of mechanisms structured to help us achieve competitive cost. We typically enter into a combination of long-term and medium-term supply contracts and source our raw materials from multiple suppliers across different regions and from multiple sites per supplier. Furthermore, we typically purchase multiple grades of ore from each supplier to limit our exposure to any single supplier for any single grade of ore in any given time period. Historically, we have not experienced any problems renewing such contracts for raw materials or securing our supply of titanium-bearing ores.
 We play an active role in ore source development around the globe, especially for those ores which can only be used by us, given the capability of our unique process technology. Supply chain flexibility allows for ore purchase and use optimization to manage short-term demand fluctuations and provides long-term competitive advantage. Our process technology and ability to use lower grade ilmenite ore gives us the flexibility to alter our ore mix to the lowest cost configuration based on sales, demand, and projected ore pricing. Lastly, we have taken steps to optimize routes for distribution and increase storage capacity at our production facilities.
 Transporting chlorine, one of our primary raw materials, can be costly. To reduce our expense and our need to transport chlorine, we have a chlor-alkali production facility run by a third-party that is co-located at our New Johnsonville, Tennessee site. Calcined petroleum coke is an important raw material input to our process. We source calcined petroleum coke from well-established suppliers in North America and China, typically under contracts that run multiple years to facilitate materials and logistics planning through the supply chain. Distribution efficiency is enhanced through the use of bulk ocean, barge, and rail transportation modes.

The Chemours Company
 
Energy is another key input cost in the TiO2 manufacturing process, representing approximately 12% of the production cost. We have access to natural gas-based energy at our U.S. and Mexico TiO2 production facilities and our Florida minerals plant, supporting advantaged energy costs given the low cost of shale gas in the U.S. 
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
 We sell the majority of our products through a direct sales force. We also utilize third-party sales agents and distributors to expand our reach. TiO2 pigment represents a significant raw material cost for our direct customers, and as a result, purchasing decisions are often made by our customers’ senior management teams. TiO2 pigment, however, is only a small fraction of the cost when considering certain end-use applications, especially in segments with larger value chain players, such as specialty coatings, plastics, and laminates applications. Our sales organization works to develop and maintain close relationships with key decision-makers in our value chain. 
 In addition to close purchasing relationships, our sales and technical service teams work together to develop relationships with all layers of our customers’ organizations to ensure that we meet our customers’ commercial and technical requirements. When appropriate, we collaborate closely with customers to solve formulation or application problems by modifying product characteristics or developing new product grades.
 To ensure an efficient distribution, we have a large fleet of railcars, which are predominantly used for outbound distribution of products in the U.S. and Canada. A dedicated logistics team, along with external partners, continually optimizes the assignment of our transportation equipment to product lines and geographic regions in order to maximize utilization and maintain an efficient supply chain.
 Customers
 Globally, we serve approximately 700 customers through our Titanium Technologies segment. In 2017, our 10 largest Titanium Technologies customers accounted for approximately 35% of the segment’s net sales, and one Titanium Technologies customer represented more than 10% of the segment’s net sales. Our larger customers in the U.S. and Europe are typically served through direct sales and tend to have medium-term to long-term contracts. We serve our small-size and mid-size customers through a combination of our direct sales and distribution network.
 Our direct customers in Titanium Technologies are producers of decorative coatings, automotive and industrial coatings, polyolefin masterbatches, PVC window profiles, engineering polymers, laminate paper, coatings paper, and coated paperboard. We focus on developing long-term partnerships with key market participants in each of these sectors. We also deliver a high level of technical service to satisfy our customers’ specific needs, which helps us maintain strong customer relationships.
 Seasonality
 The demand for TiO2 is subject to seasonality due to the influence of weather conditions and holiday seasons on some of our applications, such as decorative coatings. As a result, our TiO2 sales volume is typically lowest in the first quarter, highest in the second and third quarters, and moderate in the fourth quarter. This pattern applies to the entire TiO2 market, but may vary by region, country, or application. It can also be altered by economic or other demand cycles.
 Fluoroproducts Segment
 Segment Overview
 Our Fluoroproducts segment is a global leader in providing fluorine-based, advanced materials solutions. The segment creates products that have unique properties, such as high temperature resistance, high chemical resistance, and unique di-electric properties, for applications across a broad array of industries and applications. We are a global leader in providing fluoroproducts, such as refrigerants and industrial fluoropolymer resins and derivatives. 
 The manufacturing of fluoroproducts involves complex processes that include the use of highly corrosive and hazardous intermediates. We have an industry-leading safety culture and apply world-class technical expertise to ensure that our operations run safely and reliably. These capabilities, alongside our R&D expertise, allow us to continuously improve our process technology.
 We sell fluoroproducts through two primary product groups: Fluorochemicals and Fluoropolymers.

The Chemours Company
 
Fluorochemicals products include refrigerants, industrial coolers, air conditioning, foam blowing agents, propellants, and fire suppression products. We have held a leading position in the fluorochemicals market since the commercial introduction of Freon™ in 1930. Since the original chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-based product was introduced, we have been at the forefront of new technology research for lower GWP and lesser ozone-depleting potential products, leading to the development of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). We have a leading position in HFC refrigerants under the brand name Freon™, and we are a leader in the development of sustainable technologies like Opteon™, a line of low GWP hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) refrigerants, which also have a zero-ozone-depletion footprint. Opteon™ was jointly developed with Honeywell International, Inc. (Honeywell) in response to the European Union’s (EU) Mobile Air Conditioning Directive. This patented technology offers similar functionality to current HFC products, but meets or exceeds currently-mandated environmental standards and, in some cases, provides energy efficiency benefits.
 We led the industry in the Montreal-Protocol (1987)-driven transition from CFCs to the lesser ozone-depleting HCFCs and non-ozone-depleting HFCs. In 1988, we committed to cease production of CFCs and started manufacturing non-ozone-depleting HFCs in the early 1990s. Driven by new and emerging environmental legislations, and standards currently being implemented across the U.S., Europe, Latin America, and Japan, we have commercialized Opteon™. Over the years, regulations have pushed the industry to evolve and respond to environmental concerns. We will continue to invest in R&D to remain a leader and meet our customers’ needs as regulations change.
 Fluorochemicals’ refrigerant sales fluctuate by season as sales in the first half of the year generally are slightly higher than sales in the second half of the year, due to mobile applications. However, Opteon™ sales into mobile air markets will be driven by automotive production, which may lead to less seasonality within Fluorochemicals overall.
 Fluoropolymers products include various industrial resins, specialty products, and coatings. We serve a wide range of industrial and end-user applications, including electronics, communications, wires and cable, energy, consumer, oil and gas, and aerospace, among others. Our products’ unique properties include chemical inertness, thermal stability, non-stick adhesion, low friction, weather and corrosion resistance, and extreme temperature resistance.
 Our Fluoropolymers products are sold under the brand names Teflon™, Viton™, Krytox™, and Nafion™. Teflon™ coatings and additives are used in multiple end-products including paints, fabrics, carpets, clothing, and other household applications. Teflon™ coatings, resins, additives, and films are also used in a wide range of industrial products. Our fluoroelastomer products, sold under the Viton™ brand name, are used in automotive, consumer electronics, chemical processing, oil and gas, petroleum refining and transportation, and aircraft and aerospace applications. Our Krytox™-branded lubricants are used in a broad range of industrial applications, including bearings, electric motors, and gearboxes. We sell membranes under the brand name Nafion™, which are used in fuel cells, energy flow battery storage, transportation, stationary power, and medical tubing.

The Chemours Company
 
Fluoroproducts demand growth is generally in line with global GDP. Within Fluorochemicals, growth may be higher than GDP in situations where, for environmental reasons, regulatory drivers constrain the market or drive the market toward lower GWP alternatives. In Fluoropolymers, overall market growth is expected to be in line with GDP over the next few years, but influenced by increased competition and pricing pressure in some businesses. There are certain emerging technologies, along with our focus on applications development, that may drive our growth at a rate faster than GDP. 
 Developed markets represent the largest fluoroproducts markets today. Global middle class growth and the increasing demand for expanding infrastructure, alternative energy, consumer electronics, telecommunications, automobiles, refrigerators, and air conditioners are all key drivers of increased demand for various fluoroproducts.
 Raw Materials
 The primary raw materials required to support the Fluoroproducts segment are fluorspar, chlorinated organics, chlorinated inorganics, hydrofluoric acid, and vinylidene fluoride. These are available in many countries and not concentrated in any particular region.
 Our supply chains are designed for maximum competitiveness through favorable sourcing of key raw materials. Our contracts typically include terms that span from two to 10 years, except for select resale purchases that are negotiated on a monthly basis. Most qualified fluorspar sources have fixed contract prices or freely-negotiated, market-based pricing. Although the fluoroproducts industry has historically relied primarily on fluorspar exports from China, we have diversified our sourcing through multiple geographic regions and suppliers to ensure a stable and cost competitive supply. Our current supply agreements are generally in effect for the next five years.
 Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
 With more than 85 years of innovation and development in fluorine science, our technical, marketing, and sales teams around the world have deep expertise in our products and their end-uses. We work with customers to select the appropriate fluoroproducts to meet their technical performance needs. We sell our products through direct channels and through resellers. Selling agreements vary by product line and markets served and include both spot-pricing arrangements and contracts with a typical duration of one year.
 We maintain a large fleet of railcars, tank trucks, and containers to deliver our products and support our supply chain needs. For the portion of the fleet that is leased, the related lease terms are usually staggered, which provides us with a competitive cost position, as well as the ability to adjust the size of our fleet in response to changes in market conditions. A dedicated logistics team, along with external partners, continually optimizes the assignment of our transportation equipment to product lines and geographic regions in order to maximize utilization and flexibility of the supply chain.
 Customers
 We serve approximately 2,700 customers and distributors globally and, in many instances, these commercial relationships have been in place for decades. No single Fluoroproducts customer represented more than 10% of the segment’s net sales in 2017.
Seasonality
 Fluorochemicals’ refrigerant sales fluctuate by season as sales in the first half of the year generally are slightly higher than sales in the second half of the year, due to mobile applications. Seasonality in Fluorochemicals sales is mainly driven by increased demand for residential, commercial, and automotive air conditioning in the spring. This demand peaks in the summer months and declines in the fall and winter. Commercial refrigeration demand is fairly steady throughout the year, but demand is slightly higher during the summer months. Mobile air conditioning demand is slightly higher in the first half of the year due to the timing of automotive shut downs in the second half. Our OpteonTM sales into mobile air markets will be driven by automotive production, which may lead to less seasonality within Fluorochemicals overall. There is no significant seasonality for Fluoropolymers, as demand is relatively consistent throughout the year; however, demand is slightly higher during the first half of the year.
 Chemical Solutions Segment
 Segment Overview
 Our Chemical Solutions segment comprises a portfolio of industrial chemical businesses, primarily operating in the Americas. The Chemical Solutions segment’s products are used as important raw materials and catalysts for a diverse group of industries including, among others, gold production, oil and gas, water treatment, electronics, and automotive.

We are a leading provider of sodium cyanide in the Americas through our Mining Solutions business. 

 11

The Chemours Company
 
As part of our transformation plan announced in 2015, we conducted a strategic review of our Chemical Solutions segment. This process resulted in the divestiture of three assets and businesses, the shutdown of one business, and the decision to retain the remaining businesses. Specifically, we sold our aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas to The Dow Chemical Company (Dow) in March 2016. We also sold our Sulfur business to Veolia North America, Inc. (Veolia) in July 2016 and our C&D business to LANXESS Corporation (Lanxess) in August 2016. These divestitures resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $685 million in 2016. In addition, we ceased production at our RMS facility in Niagara Falls, New York in September 2016. The segment continues to include our Mining Solutions business, an aniline manufacturing unit in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and the product lines at our Belle, West Virginia site, which include our Methylamines, Glycolic Acid, and Vazo™ free radical initiators product lines.
 Chemical Solutions operates at three production facilities in North America, which sell products and solutions through two primary product groups: Mining Solutions and Performance Chemicals and Intermediates. The Mining Solutions product group includes our sodium cyanide, hydrogen cyanide, and potassium cyanide product lines. We are the market leader in solid sodium cyanide production in the Americas, which is used primarily by the mining industry for gold and silver production. We are also investing in a new sodium cyanide production facility in Mexico that is expected to be completed in 2018. In the Performance Chemicals and Intermediates product group, we manufacture a wide variety of chemicals used in many different applications. Following our recent divestitures, Performance Chemicals and Intermediates is now comprised of our Methylamines, Glycolic Acid, Vazo™, and Aniline product lines. Our Performance Chemicals and Intermediates business is expected to generally grow in line with growth in global GDP.

Industry Overview and Competitors
 The industrial and specialty chemicals produced by our Chemical Solutions segment are important raw materials for a wide range of industries and end-markets. We hold a long-standing reputation for high quality and the safe-handling of hazardous products, such as sodium cyanide, methylamines, aniline, and Vazo™. Our positions in these products are the result of our process technology, manufacturing scale, efficient supply chain, and proximity to large customers. Our Chemical Solutions segment also holds, and occasionally licenses, what we believe to be leading process technologies for the production of hydrogen and sodium cyanide, which are used in industrial polymers and gold production.
 We have global leadership positions in the product categories as set forth in the following table.
 
 
Chemical Solutions Leadership Positions
---------------------------------------
Product Group | Position | Key Applications | Key Competitors 
Mining Solutions | #1 in Solid Sodium Cyanide in the Americas | Gold Production | Orica Limited Cyanco Corporation

Raw Materials
 Key raw materials for Chemical Solutions include ammonia, methanol, natural gas, hydrogen, and caustic soda. We source raw materials from global and regional suppliers, where possible, and maintain multiple supplier relationships to protect against supply disruptions and potential price increases. To further mitigate the risk of raw materials availability and cost fluctuations, our Chemical Solutions segment has also taken steps to optimize routes for distribution, lock in long-term contracts with key suppliers, and increase the number of customer contracts with raw materials price pass-through terms. We do not believe that the loss of any particular supplier would be material to our business.
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
 Our technical, marketing, and sales teams around the world have deep expertise with our products and their end-markets. We predominantly sell directly to end-customers, although we also use a network of distributors for specific product lines and geographies. Sales may take place through either spot transactions or via long-term contracts.
 Most of Chemical Solutions’ raw materials and products can be delivered by efficient bulk transportation. As such, we maintain a large fleet of railcars, tank trucks, and containers to support our supply chain needs. For the portion of the fleet that is leased, the related lease terms are usually staggered, which provides us with a competitive cost position as well as the ability to adjust the size of our container fleet in response to changes in market conditions. A dedicated logistics team, along with external partners, continually optimizes the assignment of our transportation equipment to product lines and geographic regions in order to maximize utilization and flexibility of the supply chain.
 The strategic placement of our production facilities in locations designed to serve our key customer base in the Americas gives us robust distribution capabilities.
 Customers
 Our Chemical Solutions segment focuses on developing long-term partnerships with key market participants. Many of our commercial and industrial relationships have been in place for decades and are based on our proven value proposition of safely and reliably supplying our customers with the materials needed for their operations. Our reputation and long-term track record are key competitive advantages as several of the products’ end-users demand the highest level of excellence in safe manufacturing, distribution, handling, and storage. Our Chemical Solutions segment has U.S. Department of Transportation Special Permits and Approvals in place for the distribution of various materials associated with each of our business lines, as required. Our Chemical Solutions segment serves approximately 500 customers globally. No single Chemical Solutions customer represented more than 10% of the segment’s net sales in 2017.
Seasonality
 Our Chemical Solutions segment sales are subject to minimal seasonality.

Intellectual Property
 Intellectual property, including trade secrets, certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, and other proprietary rights, is a critical part of maintaining our technology leadership and competitive edge. Our business strategy is to file patent and trademark applications globally for proprietary new product and application development technologies. We hold many patents, particularly in our Fluoroproducts segment, as described herein. These patents, including various patents that will expire from 2018 through 2034, in the aggregate, are believed to be of material importance to our business. However, we believe that no single patent (or related group of patents) is material in relation to our business as a whole. In addition, particularly in our Titanium Technologies segment, we hold significant intellectual property in the form of trade secrets, and, while we believe that no single trade secret is material in relation to our combined business as a whole, we believe that our trade secrets are material in the aggregate. Unlike patents, trade secrets do not have a pre-determined validity period, but are valid indefinitely, so long as their secrecy is maintained. We work actively on a global basis to create, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights. The protection afforded by these patents and trademarks varies based on country, scope of individual patent, and trademark coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country. Although certain proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we do not believe that we are materially-dependent on any particular patent or trademark. We believe that securing our intellectual property is critical to maintaining our technology leadership and our competitive position, especially with respect to new technologies or the extensions of existing technologies. Our proprietary process technology can be a source of incremental income through licensing arrangements.
 Our Titanium Technologies segment in particular relies upon unpatented proprietary knowledge, continuing technological innovation, and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position in this sector. Our proprietary chloride production process is an important part of our technology, and our business could be harmed if our trade secrets are not maintained in confidence. In our Titanium Technologies segment’s intellectual property portfolio, we consider our trademarks Ti-Pure™ and BaiMaxTM to be valuable assets and have registered the Ti-PureTM trademark in a number of countries and the BaiMaxTM trademark in China.
 Our Fluoroproducts segment is the technology leader in the markets in which it participates. We have one of the largest patent portfolios in the fluorine derivatives industry. In our Fluoroproducts segment’s intellectual property portfolio, we consider our Freon™, Opteon™, Teflon™, Viton™, NafionTM, and Krytox™ trademarks to be valuable assets.
 Our Chemical Solutions segment is a manufacturing and application development technology leader in a majority of the markets in which it participates. Trade secrets are one of the key elements of our intellectual property security in the Chemical Solutions segment, as most of the segment’s manufacturing and application development technologies are no longer under patent coverage.
 At the Separation, certain of our subsidiaries entered into an intellectual property cross-license agreement with DuPont, pursuant to which (i) DuPont has agreed to license to us certain patents, know-how, and technical information owned by DuPont or its affiliates which are necessary or useful in our business, and (ii) we have agreed to license to DuPont certain patents owned by us or our affiliates which are necessary or useful in DuPont’s business. In most circumstances, the licenses are perpetual, irrevocable, sub-licensable (in connection with the party’s business), assignable (in connection with a sale of the applicable portion of a party’s business or assets, subject to certain exceptions) worldwide licenses in connection with the current operations of the businesses and, with respect to specified products and fields of use, future operations of such businesses, subject to certain limitations with respect to specified products and fields of use.
 Research and Development
 We perform R&D activities in all of our segments, with the majority of our efforts focused in the Fluoroproducts segment. The Fluoroproducts segment efforts center around developing new sustainable fluorochemicals, as well as determining new applications and formulations for fluoropolymers that meet our customers’ technical requirements. In the Titanium Technologies and Chemical Solutions segments, our efforts are focused on process technology to reduce cost and maintain safety and stewardship standards. 
 The following table sets forth our R&D expense by segment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
 
 
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
---------------------------------------+-------------------------+---
(Dollars in millions) | 2017 | | 2016 | | | 2015

Backlog
 In general, we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders and do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of our future sales activity. Our production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
