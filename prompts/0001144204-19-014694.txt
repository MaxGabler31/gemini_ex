Item 1. Business Description
Overview
 
Pareteum Corporation (Nasdaq: TEUM) is a rapidly growing cloud software communications platform company with a mission - to connect every person and every(thing) ™.
 
Millions of people and devices are connected around the world using Pareteum’s global cloud software communications platform, enhancing their mobile experience. Pareteum unleashes the power of applications and mobile services, bringing secure, ubiquitous, scalable, and seamlessly available voice, video, SMS/text messaging, and data services to our customers, making worldwide communications services easily and economically accessible to everyone. By harnessing the value of our cloud communications platform, Pareteum serves enterprises, communications service providers, early stage innovators, developers, Internet-of-Things (“IoT”), and telecommunications infrastructure providers Pareteum envisions a new mobile communications experience imagining what will be, and delivering now.
 
With estimates of up to 30 billion devices to be managed and connected the total available market is astoundingly large. Service Providers, Brand Marketing Companies, Enterprise and Internet of Things providers use Pareteum to energize their growth and profitability through cloud communication services and complete turnkey solutions featuring relevant content, applications, and connectivity worldwide. To achieve this, Pareteum has developed, and added through its acquisition of Artilium plc, public limited company registered in England and Wales (“Artilium”) and iPass Inc., patent pending software platforms which are connected to 59 mobile networks in 80 counties using multiple different communications channels including mobile telephony, data, SMS, VOIP, OTT services – all over the world. Pareteum integrates all these disparate communications methods and services and brings them to life for customers and application developers, allowing communications to become value-added. This is a major strategic target for many industries, from legacy telecommunications providers to the disruptive technology and data enterprises of today and the future.

The vast majority of our platform is comprised of our self-developed software and intellectual property, which provides our customers with a great deal of flexibility in how they use our products now and in the future and allows us to be market driven in our future.  We have approximately 40 patents granted in relation to techniques and processes which support our cloud software and communications platform solutions.  Our platform services partners (technologies integrated into our cloud) include: HPE, IBM, Sonus, Oracle, Microsoft, NetNumber, Affirmed and other world class technology providers. 
 
Pareteum is a mission focused company empowering every person and every “thing” to be globally connected – ANY DEVICE, ANY NETWORK, ANYWHERE™. The Pareteum cloud communications platform targets large and growing sectors from IoT, Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO), Smart Cities, and Application developer markets - each in need of mobile platforms, management and connectivity. These sectors need Communications-Platform-as-a-Service (CPaaS), which Pareteum delivers. Our solutions have received industry acclaim.
 
At Pareteum, our mission is to create an easily accessible open mobility system for the world. We believe that open software and interfaces for mobility and applications will create more innovation, economic freedom, and opportunity equality worldwide, just like the internet did for information.
 
The Pareteum Ecosystem
 
Our value proposition intersects with numerous applications and industries. It is our strong belief that no other company in the CPaaS market offers similarly broad value in such a comprehensive way. An easily accessible open mobility system for the world is difficult to get started because it requires a “network effect”. The network effect is an observable condition that yields increased value to the “new easily accessible open mobility system for the world”, and all users of the system as more users come on board. The essence of this point is that every communication – a transaction – requires both a sender and recipient who are willing to access and use the new system. We aim to provide the marketplace exchange on which these transactions take place, and will attract new users.
Innovative Use Cases
 
Many sectors, from traditional network operators to disruptive technology and data-driven companies have found many innovative use cases for our platforms. Beyond simply enabling communications between people and devices, the platforms of Pareteum enable:

Ø | Smart homes, including smart appliances, smart energy meters, wearables etc.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ø | Connected cars 
Ø | Smart cities 
Ø | Smart logistics and supply chains 
Ø | Smart healthcare applications 
Ø | Smart defense 

 
In addition to the foregoing, as a result of certain acquisitions completed in October 2018 and February 2019, the Company has acquired certain intellectual property portfolios, which it now manages through various wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries (the “Acquired IP Rights”). The Company utilizes patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere to protect the Acquired IP Rights.
 
One TEUM!
 
Having welcomed our TEUMates from Artilium and iPass into the group, we have immediately set about fully integrating our workforces, our technologies and our business processes to ensure that as the business grows the company’s growth rate and momentum is maintained and accelerated. We call these parallel initiatives the One Teum!

Business Model
 
At Pareteum, our mission is to create an easily accessible open mobility system for the world. We believe that open software and interfaces for communications services will create more innovation, economic freedom, and opportunity equality worldwide, just like the internet did for information.
 
However, an easily accessible open mobility system for the world is challenging to scale because it requires a “network effect”. The network effect is the principle that a service yields increased value as it grows. The essence of this point is that our business and our services will grow in value as we grow and scale. We aim to achieve that growth by providing the marketplace exchange on which these communications and transactions take place, and in doing so we attract new users and more customers.
 
To achieve our desired and rapid growth, we are using our managed services solutions as a launching pad from which to grow our Global Cloud Services Platform and Application Exchange & Developer Platform. This process is already well underway, including with our anchor customer Vodafone.
 
Go-to-Market and Growth Strategy
 
Pareteum is in fast-growth mode, which will be achieved through a combination of organic growth as well as targeted and accretive mergers & acquisitions, such as the recent acquisitions of Artilium and iPass, as well as others that will be identified from time to time.
 
Pareteum continues to win new long-term contractual business. We expect this pace to increase throughout 2019 and beyond. We see many new opportunities, including those that leverage our support of emerging technologies, which is at the heart of our identity management and payment systems integration plans.


Our focus is on selling and implementing new communications services and IoT opportunities as fast as possible, as the world of connected devices and people continues to rise on a daily basis.
 
We will measure our growth in the numbers of ‘Connections’ that we on-board to our platforms, be they SIM cards, handsets, devices, vehicles etc. As at December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,609,000 connections, an increase of 252% over the end of the prior year.
 
Our go-to-market strategy uses a four-phase approach:
 

Phase 1: | We continue to attract new subscribers across all verticals to all our platforms through direct sales, existing channel partnerships and new initiatives such as referral programs.
---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Phase 2: | We will continue to on-board new communication services providers, multiplying our own growth, largely through business development and direct sales in each of our six defined sales regions (North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pac). 
---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Phase 3: | We will drive adoption through a twin approach. First, we will be on-boarding more Connections which are already active on our Managed Services and Global Cloud Platforms, as our initial user base. Second, we will be drawing in new customers and end-users to the Application Exchange & Developer Platform. These will be people with the greatest pain point, who are underserved by the current mobility networks and applications (including in developing markets).
---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 4: | At this stage, our strategic Application Exchange & Developer Platform customers will have their own go-to-market strategy, creating shared value, ranging from traditional consumer strategies to sophisticated B2B and B2B2C strategies, driving and expanding our ecosystem to new heights.
---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The phases described above are already being implemented, in parallel as far as possible, for the fastest most sustainable growth and this highlights our strategy for accelerating the world’s shift to an open mobility and application network. When we’re successful, it will accelerate the pace of innovation in the world, create more economic freedom, and provide better mobility services to billions of underserved people.
 
Employees & Leadership Team
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 138 full-time employees worldwide.
 
Pareteum is led by its Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Officer, Robert H. Turner. He is supported by Victor Bozzo, Chief Executive Officer, and Denis McCarthy, President, working closely with Edward O’Donnell, Chief Financial Officer and Robert Mumby, Chief Revenue Officer.
 
The leadership team has many decades of combined experience in fast-growing telecoms, software and technology markets.
 
Research & Development
 
Pareteum’s research and development function ensures that its communications platforms grow in line with customer needs and technological advancement, and remain resilient, reliable and secure. We have announced innovation in e-commerce, machine learning and predictive analytics, and mobile gaming all supported by our growing Pareteum application exchange and development community. Enabling our CPaaS with identity management, transaction settlements and payment solutions greatly expands the opportunity for our customers and revenue streams for the Company. Product development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $3,092,776 compared to $1,479,587 for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Intellectual Property
 
Pareteum relies on a combination of patents, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. The Company protects its brand and reputation through the exploitation of a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks. Pareteum has two granted patents for inventions embedded in its communications platforms, and with the addition of Artilium and iPass has a patent portfolio of some 40 granted patents.
 
Pareteum further protects its intellectual property rights by requiring all its employees and independent contractors involved in the development of intellectual property to assign those rights to the Company, to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.
 
Sales & Marketing
 
Pareteum has begun to publish and market self-service capabilities which will allow new customers to deploy our system capabilities such as adding mobility to their online applications in a seamless way, quickly all through published API’s from our community portals.
Customers
 
Pareteum manages a rigorous methodology from sale to revenue through its management of customer post-sale implementation and service delivery.

A team of customer advocates is assigned to each new contract and a multi-step process of handoff from sales to service is handled by this distinct team which is made up of experienced staff around the globe and supported by back office professionals throughout the United States, United Kingdom, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin, America.
 
The Company has a significant customer and the loss of this customer could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, this significant customer accounted for approximately 40% of our revenue.
 
Competitive Differentiation
 
The CPaaS market is moving quickly. The Company believes that the key competitive differentiators in the near-term will be:
 

§ | Scale and international reach of connectivity
--+----------------------------------------------


§ | Comprehensiveness of platform offerings
--+----------------------------------------


§ | Ease of deployment and implementation
--+--------------------------------------


§ | Scalability and reliability of service
--+---------------------------------------

 
Pareteum considers itself well placed to be judged on those criteria. The Company is confident that its network of global and international connectivity partners will enable it to access markets that currently are under-served and compete equally with larger competitors in mature markets. In addition, Pareteum is confident that few other players have the breadth of value-added services to complement the core connectivity platforms. 
 
Nevertheless, some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and sales and marketing resources, as well as greater brand and market awareness, and consequently may be able to react more quickly to competitive pressures. As we execute on our growth strategies, and enter new markets, or disrupt markets and replace incumbents, we expect competition to become more intense.
 
One key tenet in our competitive strategy, however, is to actually lower the competitive barriers to market for new players (customers) to create new mobility and communications applications and businesses. We intend to disrupt existing markets and have the advantage of quick time-to-market for those newly enabled business models and opportunities. These include, for example:
 

§ | Uniquely tailored data services such as unlimited social media, messaging apps or streaming music services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Global roaming connectivity without local infrastructure: e.g. business executives using a multi-SIM worldwide phone.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Creation of personal, branded, mobile services.
--+------------------------------------------------


§ | One-stop shop for bundles of IoT and machine-to-machine (“M2M”) services: through plug-ins to multiple vertical applications and specialized platforms. One-stop shop for current and next-gen GSM and Wi-Fi connectivity, deployed seamless through our CPaaS solutions. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
