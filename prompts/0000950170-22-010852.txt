 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 23andMe Holding Co., formerly known as VG Acquisition Corp., is a mission-driven company dedicated to empowering customers to live healthier lives. The Company’s mission is to help people access, understand, and benefit from the human genome. The Company believes that its premier database of genetic and phenotypic information crowdsourced from its millions of customers that separately consent to participate in our research can revolutionize healthcare by enabling us to discover insights into the origins of diseases, to use those insights to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, and to speed the discovery and development of novel therapies. The Company is committed to rigorous scientific, ethical, and privacy standards and to being one of the most trusted source for genetic and health information.
 We pioneered direct-to-consumer genetic testing, giving consumers unique, personalized information about their genetic health risks, ancestry, and traits. We are the only consumer genetic testing company with multiple Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") authorizations for over-the-counter health and carrier status reports. We were the first company to obtain FDA authorization for a direct-to-consumer genetic test, and we are the only company to have FDA authorization, clearance, or an exemption from premarket notification for all carrier status, genetic health risk, cancer predisposition, and pharmacogenetics reports offered to customers. As of March 31, 2022, over 60 health reports were available to customers in the U.S.
 We acquired Lemonaid Health, Inc. (“Lemonaid” or “Lemonaid Health”) in November 2021 in an important step to achieve our goal of making personalized healthcare a reality. Lemonaid offers patients affordable and direct online access to medical care, from consultation through treatment, for a number of common conditions, using evidence-based guidelines and up-to-date clinical protocols to deliver quality patient care. When medications are prescribed by our medical professionals, patients can use our convenient online pharmacy for fast and free delivery.
 Operating Segments
 We operate in two reporting segments: Consumer & Research Services and Therapeutics.
Consumer & Research Services
 Our Consumer & Research Services business segment comprises our Personal Genome Service® (“PGS”), our telehealth business, and research services.
 PGS
 Our PGS service provides customers with a broad suite of genetic reports, including information on customers’ genetic ancestral origins, personal genetic health risks, and chances of passing on certain rare carrier conditions to their children, as well as reports on how genetics can impact responses to medications. We believe that by providing customers with direct access to their genetic information, we can empower them to make better decisions by arming them with information about their risks of developing certain diseases or conditions and by highlighting opportunities for prevention and mitigation of disease.

In the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”), we offer two PGS services, and also offer a premium service called 23andMe+. Ancestry + Traits Service is our base service and provides customers information about their genetic ancestral origins and how genetics may influence over 30 traits, such as physical features, sense perceptions, reactions to external stimuli and other traits. The service also includes a tool that enables customers who choose to opt in to connect with genetic relatives that are also customers of the Company. Our Health + Ancestry Service builds upon our Ancestry + Traits Service to also provide reports relating to a customer's health predisposition (including certain cancers and other health risks such as late-onset Alzheimer’s disease), carrier status (including for cystic fibrosis and hereditary hearing loss), and wellness (including for deep sleep, lactose intolerance and genetic weight), and carrier status reports. Ancestry + Traits Service customers can upgrade to the Health + Ancestry Service for a fee. We provide customers with an engaging experience, including access to updates to their genetic health and ancestry reports and new product features, and the ability to connect with genetic relatives.
 Our 23andMe+ premium subscription service offers customers the Health + Ancestry Service plus pharmacogenetic reports, personalized genetic risk reports based on our research, and advanced ancestry and health features, including insights related to heart, reproductive health and sleep. Our PGS services are available for purchase on our website, 23andMe.com, or mobile app and, in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada, through Amazon. Substantially all of the Company’s revenues are derived from the Consumer & Research Services segment, with revenue from PGS representing approximately 75%, 81%, and 89% of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
 Customers have the option to participate in our research programs and over 80% of our customers have chosen to do so. We analyze consenting customers’ genotypic data together with phenotypic data they provide to us concerning their health, physical characteristics, family origins, lifestyle, and other habits. We analyze this data using our proprietary machine learning and other analytic techniques in order to discover insights into whether and how particular genetic variants affect the likelihood of individuals developing specific diseases. These insights may highlight opportunities to develop a drug to treat or cure a specific disease, and also provide information that customers can use to enhance their medical care and treatment, including care accessed through our Lemonaid telehealth platform.
  Telehealth
 The acquisition of Lemonaid provided us with telehealth capabilities and enhances our ability to bring better healthcare and wellness offerings to patients. Our telehealth platform provides patients with easy access to medical consultation and treatment. Within minutes, a patient can interact with one of our affiliated licensed physicians or nurse practitioners via telehealth. If a prescription is warranted, the patient can access our pharmacy services for fast and free delivery. Our pharmacies offer non-controlled medications for prevention and treatment of acute and chronic conditions at affordable prices, and our pharmacists provide ongoing support to ensure proper care by counseling, educating, and following up with patients. Our goal is to make personalized healthcare services affordable and accessible, focusing on both the prevention and treatment of disease. We make telehealth services available in the U.S. and, under a third-party brand, in the U.K.
Affiliated Professional Medical Corporations. Because many states limit the ownership of medical practices to licensed professionals and prohibit corporate ownership of medical practices, we offer medical services through affiliated professional medical corporations (“PMCs”) that are owned by a licensed medical provider in the applicable jurisdiction. All of the doctors and nurse practitioners who provide medical services to our patients are employees of the PMCs. Lemonaid, our wholly owned subsidiary, has a management services agreement (“MSA”) with each PMC pursuant to which Lemonaid provides business, administrative and non-clinical services to the PMC in exchange for a fixed fee. These services include IT, billing, insurance, tax, accounting and other administrative services, and do not include any clinical, diagnostic or treatment decisions, which are made solely by licensed practitioners based on quality medical care guidelines and protocols. The MSAs are exclusive arrangements, and the PMCs were established specifically to provide medical services through our platform.

Affiliated Pharmacies. Our patients may choose to fill prescriptions provided to them by our affiliated medical professionals by using our pharmacy services. We facilitate the delivery of pharmacy services by our affiliated mail order pharmacy, offering patients affordable, fast and free delivery services throughout the U.S. We also manage an affiliated retail pharmacy that is able to accept insurance from government and commercial providers where applicable. Almost all of our pharmacy services are provided on a self-pay basis and are not covered by third-party payors. We also provide a small number of compounded medications that are fulfilled by a third-party service provider that is not affiliated with us. We manage our affiliated pharmacies under MSAs pursuant to which we provide all administrative services as well as licensed pharmacists, support staff and infrastructure. Our MSAs with our affiliated pharmacies are exclusive arrangements, and the affiliated pharmacies were established specifically to provide prescription medications when patients choose to use our platform to fill prescriptions written by our affiliated licensed medical professionals.
  Research Services
 Through our research services, we use our vast database of genetic and phenotypic information provided by consenting customers to discover insights into the genetic origins of disease and to identify targets for drug development. These services are performed under agreements with universities, research institutions and pharmaceutical companies, including our multi-year collaboration agreement with an affiliate of GlaxoSmithKline (“GSK”), which was signed in July 2018 (the “GSK Agreement”) to leverage genetic insights to validate, develop, and commercialize drugs. The GSK Agreement is expected to identify and prioritize genetically validated drug targets, enable rapid progression of clinical programs, and bring useful new drugs to market. We also provide clinical trial services to accelerate patient recruitment by using our database to identify patients most likely to be eligible for participation in a clinical trial of a new drug. We currently have research programs across several therapeutic areas, including oncology, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases.
Therapeutics
 Our Therapeutics business segment focuses on the use of genetic insights from our vast database of genetic and phenotypic information to develop novel therapies to improve patients’ lives. The Therapeutics segment consists of revenues from the out-licensing of intellectual property associated with identified drug targets and expenses related to therapeutic product candidates under clinical development. In addition to our collaboration with GSK, we have several proprietary programs, one of which is being pursued in collaboration with Almirall, S.A.
 As of March 31, 2022, two of our programs had entered Phase 1 trials. One is from our proprietary programs, 23ME-00610, previously known as P006, which had started the Phase 1 in patients with advanced solid tumors. 23ME-00610 is a high-affinity humanized monoclonal antibody that is designed to interfere with the ability of CD200R1 to interact with CD200 found on cancer cells. The other one is immuno-oncology program, GSK6097608, led by GSK, an antibody that targets the CD96. CD96 sequesters a shared ligand (CD155) away from the costimulatory receptor (CD226), effectively attenuating T and NK cell anti-tumor immune responses. By blocking CD96, GSK6097608 may allow activation of CD226 and enhance anti-tumor immunity through T and NK cells. If a successful therapy were to be developed and commercialized by GSK using this target, we would be entitled to a royalty under the GSK Agreement.
Business Strategy
 •Building the most trusted brand in the industry. Our customers and our patients are our partners. We seek to empower them with knowledge that will help them, and ultimately will help everyone, to live happier, healthier and longer lives. They choose how to use the genetic and health information we provide to them. We respect their choices, and we work every day to earn and keep their trust.


•Revolutionizing healthcare. Traditional healthcare is impersonal, difficult, and frustrating for consumers, and focuses on treatment and not prevention of disease. We believe that our customer-centric, personalized model has the power to radically shift traditional healthcare to a new focus on individualized care and prevention. We believe that our trusted brand, millions of engaged customers, and unique database of genetic information, combined with our telehealth platform for delivering affordable personalized care efficiently to patients, will provide us with the opportunity to create a new and innovative healthcare model that will drive future growth. 
 •Scaling research. Our research platform is based on a continually growing database of genotypic and phenotypic information. Our database allows us to conduct analyses in a multi-directional fashion, by searching for genetic signatures of particular diseases or the likelihood of a particular genetic variant causing disease in a particular individual or group of individuals who share the same trait. Our platform enables us to rapidly and serially conduct studies across an almost unlimited number of conditions at unprecedented statistical power, yielding insights into the causes and potential treatments of a wide variety of diseases.
 •Efficiently develop novel therapeutics. We believe that our research platform enables us to rapidly identify drug targets with improved odds of clinical success. With our state-of- the-art bioinformatics capabilities, we analyze the trillions of data points in our database, optimizing the use of our resources, to identify drug targets, inform patient selection for clinical trials and increase the probability of success of our programs. We plan to advance new drugs through the development process by rapidly selecting those with compelling clinical promise.
 •Maximizing our collaborations. Since inception, we have worked with researchers in academia and in biopharma to demonstrate the quality and power of our database and advance discoveries, resulting in more than 180 published papers. Our collaboration with GSK further validates our drug discovery approach and expands our reach through GSK’s size and deep expertise. We plan to continue to leverage synergistic relationships to advance the development of our own, as well as our jointly owned, clinical programs.
 •Dreaming Big. We have a founder-led, inclusive, entrepreneurially inspired and scientifically rigorous approach to all we do. Our customer-first, patient-focused and data-driven people believe in our vision of “healthy at 100” and are dedicated to our mission of helping people access, understand and benefit from the human genome. Their commitment to our vision and our mission differentiates us from other companies in the healthcare industry. 
 Acquisitions
 VGAC Business Combination
 On June 16, 2021, the Company consummated the transactions (the “Merger”) contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated February 4, 2021, as amended on February 13, 2021 and March 25, 2021, by and among VG Acquisition Corp., a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company in 2020 (“VGAC”), Chrome Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned direct subsidiary of VGAC (the “Merger Sub”), and 23andMe, Inc. In connection with the Merger, VGAC changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware and changed its name to 23andMe Holding Co. (the “Domestication”). On the closing date, the Merger Sub merged with and into 23andMe, Inc., with 23andMe, Inc. being the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (together with the Merger and the Domestication, the “Business Combination”).
Lemonaid Acquisition
 We completed our acquisition of Lemonaid on November 1, 2021 (the “Lemonaid Acquisition”). Lemonaid, an on-demand platform for accessing medical care and pharmacy services online, offers telemedicine, lab, and pharmacy services to patients in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.K. We believe that the addition of Lemonaid's telehealth services to our consumer business will enable us to bring better healthcare to individuals in an affordable and accessible way and offer access to personalized healthcare, based on a patient’s wellness, choices, and genetics.
Market Opportunity
 Consumer - PGS
 We believe that our ability to analyze genetic information and provide personalized reports on genetic variations that are known to be associated with important health conditions empowers our customers. Armed with this personalized information, our customers have the ability to make informed, proactive decisions about their health and their lives. As of March 31, 2022, we had approximately 12.8 million customers.
We expect to continue to develop and provide to our customers new reports, including reports on cancer risk, diet, reproductive health, fitness and injuries, sleep, pharmacogenetics, and autoimmune conditions. Additionally, we believe that direct-to-consumer genetic health testing is gaining wider acceptance by physicians in the U.S., and that we will be able to drive further acceptance through our telehealth platform.
We expect to continue to invest in expanding our PGS offerings and marketing our PGS to customers, and that as we attract more customers, we will benefit from the network effect created by an increasing cohort of customers who recommend our PGS to their families and friends, and who reap health benefits by using their genetic information to help them and their medical providers make better decisions about their care and lifestyle choices.
 23andMe+® Subscription Service
 The 23andMe+ service is an annual subscription that provides customers with exclusive reports and features not available in the basic Health + Ancestry Service. This subscription is an add-on to our Health + Ancestry Service. 23andMe+ provides customers with additional health reports, including multiple FDA-authorized pharmacogenetics reports, as well as personalized risk score reports based on 23andMe research. These new risk scores can help customers understand certain genetic risks, such as atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, high LDL cholesterol, hypertension and migraine, and provide them with information on preventing and managing these conditions. The 23andMe+ subscription also provides customers with advanced ancestry-related features, such as enhanced tools and filters for finding genetic relatives. We are continually investing in new reports and features to provide to subscribers, and expect to add new reports for subscribers based on genetic insights from our research. We believe the 23andMe+ subscription will enhance customer engagement as subscribers receive new content with discoveries about themselves throughout the subscription period and meaningful and customized information to help them lead healthier lives. As of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, our 23andMe+ membership base had approximately 425,000 and 125,000 subscribers, respectively.
Consumer – Telehealth
 Telehealth enables consumers to access healthcare conveniently, from their homes, and to obtain fast and affordable consultation, diagnosis and treatment without the difficulties of scheduling and traveling to physical appointments. By accessing medical consultation and treatment through our telehealth platform, patients are able to take ownership of their health. Support and demand for telehealth services have been increasing due to deregulation and broad societal shifts. We believe that we have the innovative, patient-first care model, the technical platform, the nationwide provider network, and the extensive pharmacy capabilities to be a leading provider of healthcare. Patients can interact with our medical providers through either synchronous or asynchronous consultations, depending on patient's need and applicable regulatory requirements. Our system enables us to deliver convenient, easy-to-access and discrete online care without an appointment. In the future, we plan to offer patients the opportunity to integrate genetic information into their healthcare, which we believe will enhance the ability of our medical providers to offer diagnoses and treatment tailored to our patients’ individual needs.
Therapeutics
 We believe our research platform can transform the process of drug development. Genetic data can significantly improve our understanding of diseases, their pathways and mechanisms, leading to the design and development of more targeted medicines. Use of genetic data in selecting drug targets can increase both the probability of success in a particular indication and avoid unwanted safety risks. The scale of our database provides us with a unique opportunity to pursue genetically targeted drug discovery by enabling us to:
 •Query data that enable us to identify a statistically meaningful number of individuals who report having a particular disease, which we then use to determine whether the presence or absence of a particular genetic variant increases or decreases the likelihood of developing a disease;
 •Conduct discovery at scale based on a substantial number of novel associations from a diverse range of people;
 •Improve target selection with the aim of discovering safer, more effective “precision” medicines;
 •Support identification of patient subgroups that are more likely to respond to targeted treatments; and
 •More quickly identify and recruit patients for clinical studies from our re-contactable database.


Competition
Consumer (PGS and Telehealth)
 The number of companies entering the personal genetics market with offerings similar to our direct-to-consumer PGS continues to increase. We also face competition from other companies attempting to capitalize on the same, or similar, opportunities as we are, including from existing diagnostic, laboratory services and other companies entering the personal genetics market with new offerings such as direct access and/or consumer self-pay tests and genetic interpretation services. Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more quickly or efficiently than we can to new or emerging technologies. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build larger customer bases than we have. Our competitors may develop products or services that are similar to our products and services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services. This could attract customers away from our services and reduce our market share. We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend on the following factors:
 •the size of our customer base;
 •the timing and market acceptance of products and services, including the developments and enhancements to those products and services, offered by us or our competitors;
 •customer service and support efforts;
 •selling and marketing efforts;
 •ease of use, performance, price and reliability of solutions developed either by us or our competitors; and
 •our brand strength relative to our competitors.
 Similarly, the markets for healthcare are intensely competitive, subject to rapid change, and significantly affected by new product and technological introductions and other market activities of industry participants. We compete directly not only with other established telehealth providers but also traditional healthcare providers and pharmacies. Our current competitors include traditional healthcare providers expanding into the telehealth market, incumbent telehealth providers, as well as new entrants into our market that are focused on direct-to-consumer healthcare. Our competitors include enterprise-focused companies that may enter the direct-to-consumer healthcare industry, as well as direct-to-consumer healthcare providers. Many of our current and potential competitors may have greater name and brand recognition, longer operating histories, significantly greater resources than we do, and may be able to offer products and services similar to those offered on our platform at more attractive prices than we can.
Additionally, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced many new users to telehealth and further reinforced its benefits to potential competitors. We believe this may drive additional industry consolidation or collaboration involving competitors that may create competitors with greater resources and access to potential patients. The COVID-19 pandemic may also cause various traditional healthcare providers to evaluate and eventually pursue telehealth options that can be paired with their in-person capabilities. These industry changes could better position our competitors to serve certain segments of our current or future markets, which could create additional price pressure. In light of these factors, even if our offerings are more effective than those of our competitors, current or potential patients may accept competitive solutions in lieu of purchasing from us.


Therapeutics
 Our therapeutics business faces substantial competition from larger, more established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with marketed products that have been accepted by the medical community, patients, and third-party payors, as well as smaller companies in our industry that have successfully identified and developed drugs. Our ability to compete in this industry may be affected by the previous adoption of such products by the medical community, patients, and third-party payors.
 We recognize that other companies, including larger pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, may be developing or have plans to develop drugs that may compete with ours. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we have. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in undertaking preclinical studies and human clinical trials of drugs, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs for use in healthcare and manufacturing, and marketing and selling approved drugs. Our competitors may discover, develop or commercialize products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than any that we are developing. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for any drug that we develop.
 We anticipate that the competition with our drugs will be based on a number of factors, including product efficacy, safety, availability, and price. The timing of market introduction of any successful drug and competitive drugs will also affect competition among products. We expect the relative speed with which we can develop drugs, complete the clinical trials and approval processes, and supply commercial quantities of such drugs to the market to be important competitive factors. Our competitive position will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes, protect our intellectual property, and to secure sufficient capital resources for the period between target identification and commercial sales of the resulting drug.
 Seasonality
 Historically, our PGS business has been seasonal, with our kit sales being dependent on seasonal holiday demand, variability in our advertising expenditures by season, and the timing of Amazon Prime Day, which has varied in recent years. We generate a significant amount of our PGS revenue during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, due to seasonal holiday demand and our increased advertising expenditures during the holiday period, which occurs during the third quarter of our fiscal year. Kit orders are recognized as revenue when the customer sends in their kit to the laboratory to be processed and genetic reports are delivered to the customer, which typically for holiday purchases tends to occur in our fourth fiscal quarter. For more information on the potential impacts of seasonality, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
 Manufacture/Supply
 For our PGS, we do not have in-house manufacturing capabilities and do not plan to develop such capacity in the foreseeable future. We do have a quality system that is compliant to 21 C.F.R. Part 820 for the regulated activities that are performed by us. We rely on third-party suppliers, which we have qualified in accordance with our quality system to provide materials (such as our saliva collection kits, bead chips, reagents or other materials and equipment used in our laboratory operations) and services. Currently, we rely on a sole supplier to manufacture our saliva collection kits. If we were to change the design of certain of the materials which we rely on, such as our bead chip or our saliva collection kit, we may be required to seek additional authorization or clearance from the FDA. Should we seek to utilize additional laboratories, prior to utilizing their services for our U.S. customers the laboratories would need to obtain appropriate Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) certification and state licensure (if required) including the validation of our testing services in accordance with FDA and CLIA regulations and expectations.


For our telehealth services, we operate an affiliated mail order pharmacy licensed in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. We rely on multiple third-party suppliers for our pharmaceuticals and there is a risk that we may experience supply chain issues that will impact our ability to fulfill prescriptions which would have a material impact on our business.
 For Therapeutics, we do not have capability nor do we plan to develop current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) capacity for the manufacture, or supply of clinical therapeutics for our clinical trials nor for commercialization. We oversee the development of, and rely on third-party suppliers to provide cGMP material for our planned clinical studies and will continue to work with contract manufacturers to improve process requirements to enable continued progress through clinical development to commercial medicines.
 COVID-19
  The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic has disrupted the Company’s general business operations since March 2020. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in all aspects of our business. We rely entirely on third-party vendors in our PGS and telehealth supply chain, including our PGS kit and array manufacturers, order fulfillment vendor, our DNA-processing lab vendor, and drug suppliers for our pharmacy business. These vendors have independent responses to managing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have not experienced any significant disruptions in our ability to deliver PGS services or fulfill and process telehealth orders to date. If we experience delays or other challenges in obtaining supplies necessary for the production, fulfillment, or distribution of the products or services we offer, it could negatively affect our ability to satisfy our obligations to customers and patients and maintain our operations in a cost-efficient manner, and have a material adverse effect on our business.
 With respect to our telehealth services, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased awareness, acceptance, and usage of virtual medical care and pharmacy services, resulting in greater consumer trial and use of telehealth. While we believe that these trends present significant opportunities for our telehealth services, it is uncertain whether the increase in demand caused by COVID-19 will continue.
 In our Therapeutics segment, the advancement of our programs requires our scientists to have physical access to our laboratory facilities on a continuing basis, and we have implemented health and safety protocols and procedures to keep our laboratory facilities operating during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also rely on third-party support for manufacturing of cGMP clinical materials for use in studies as well as healthcare institutions and investigators who participate in studies of our programs. We have yet to experience any disruption. Despite our mitigation efforts, we may experience delays or an inability to execute on our clinical and preclinical development plans, reduced revenues or other adverse impacts to our business, which are described in more detail in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
We have taken other measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including closing our offices and implementing a work-from-home policy for most of our workforce, and amplifying monitoring of our inventory levels and supply chain. Notwithstanding these measures, the spread of COVID-19 has at certain times impacted our staffing and attendance in our laboratory facilities. We may take further actions that alter our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, and stockholders or as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities.


To help our customers and others during the pandemic, we created an online COVID-19 Information Center, which contains data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and our own COVID-19 research study that evaluated genetic differences in both susceptibility and severity of the disease. The site includes data from both sources, offers people a place to learn more about the virus, and highlights conditions that carry added risks.
 Intellectual Property
 Since inception, we have considered our intellectual property (“IP”) as a critical part of our mission. We make every effort to protect our IP, and as of March 31, 2022, have built an extensive patent estate owned by 23andMe, as summarized below:
Consumer (PGS) Patent Estate
 Our PGS patent estate consists of 93 granted U.S. patents, which include 76 utility and 17 design patents that cover technologies that include graphical user interfaces, aspects of algorithms for processing genetic data, computer implemented inventions, bioinformatics, and genotyping. The PGS patent estate includes patents from a third-party patent acquisition that closed in 2021. The acquisition included 34 issued patents and six pending patent applications.
  Included in these are patents that relate to the following PGS services: (i) 11 design and 43 utility patents relate to our Ancestry + Traits Service, (ii) 13 design and 43 utility patents relate to our Health + Ancestry Service, and (iii) 11 utility patents relate to our 23andMe+ service. The PGS patent estate also includes 51 pending patent applications, which include two design applications, 39 U.S. utility applications, five Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) applications, two Canadian patent applications, and three European patent applications. Included in these are applications that relate to the following PGS services: (i) two design and 29 U.S. utility applications, three European patent applications, two Canadian patent applications, and four PCT applications relate to our Ancestry + Traits Service, (ii) two design, 30 U.S. utility applications, three European patent applications, two Canadian patent applications, and four PCT applications relate to our Health + Ancestry Service, and (iii) five U.S. utility applications and one PCT application relate to our 23andMe+ service.

 Therapeutics Patent Estate
 Our therapeutics patent estate consists of one granted U.S. patent and one granted Nigerian patent, which includes two utility patents that cover key areas of our past and current therapeutic development candidates. The therapeutics patent estate also includes 49 pending U.S. utility and foreign utility patent applications, which include five U.S. utility applications and 44 foreign utility patent applications, covering key areas of our past and current therapeutic development candidates. These applications include those in the following jurisdictions: the PCT, Gulf Cooperation Council, Argentina, Taiwan, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Eurasia, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Macau, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and South Africa. The subject matter of the therapeutics patent portfolio relates to our immuno-oncology and inflammatory disease and other therapeutic areas. Our therapeutics patent portfolio has expected expiration dates ranging from about 2039 to about 2043.


Please note that we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we have filed or may file in the future, and we cannot be sure that any patents that have been granted or may be granted to us in the future will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
 We also appropriately guard our company trade secrets and know-how to maintain our business advantage and seek to identify and obtain third-party licenses where useful. In circumstances where we rely on trade secrets or proprietary know-how to protect our technology, we seek to protect such IP, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, partners and advisors. We also internally designate levels of sensitive information with certain groups within the Company. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our trade secrets or proprietary know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets or proprietary know-how may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates, please see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks related to our intellectual property” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
 Government Regulation
 Consumer (PGS) Business
 Our genetic health risk, carrier status, and pharmacogenetic reports are subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing, distribution, and export of diagnostic products. The third-party laboratories that we contract with to perform the laboratory portions of our service are subject to oversight by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) pursuant to CLIA, as well as agencies in various states, including New York. We are subject to many other federal, state and foreign laws, including anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickback and patient privacy. Failure to comply with applicable requirements can lead to sanctions, including withdrawal of products from the market, recalls, refusal to authorize government contracts, product seizures, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, civil money penalties, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.
Regulation of In Vitro (“IVD”) Diagnostics and Medical Devices
 IVDs are regulated by the FDA in the U.S. as medical devices in accordance with the FDCA and its implementing regulations. The FDCA and its implementing regulations govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of our medical devices.
Medical devices must undergo premarket review prior to commercialization unless the device is exempt from such review or was in commercial distribution prior to May 28, 1976 (referred to as a “pre-amendment” device).
•For devices that require submission of a 510(k) premarket notification, the regulatory process requires the applicant to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as, that is, substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed predicate device. The applicant must submit information that supports its determination that its subject device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. 510(k) premarket notifications do not generally require clinical data. The 510(k) premarket notification pathway generally takes from three to nine months from the date the application is accepted for review but can take longer.
 •For devices that require approval of a premarket application (“PMA”), the PMA process requires the applicant to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective. The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data 


and information in the PMA application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). PMA applications generally require extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation (21 CFR Part 820) (“QSR”), which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny the approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. The average review time for a PMA application is one to two years, but can take longer.
 •Novel device technologies, including novel device changes, that have not been previously classified by the FDA and for which there is no suitable predicate device are considered Class III “by default” under the FDCA and would thus require a PMA. However, if the application of general and/or special controls can provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, novel device technologies that are Class III “by default” may be eligible for authorization by the FDA via the De Novo pathway. To obtain marketing authorization via the De Novo pathway, the applicant must show that the subject device is low to moderate risk, such that it can be reclassified as Class I or Class II. The De Novo request pathway usually requires more testing data than a 510(k), and often requires clinical data. The average review time for a De Novo request is nine to 12 months but it can take longer.
 Should a company need clinical data to support a premarket application, the FDA regulates clinical investigations through its Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) regulations 21 C.F.R. Part 812. Clinical investigations of devices that are of a significant risk require pre-approval from the FDA. Investigations of devices that are of a non-significant risk do not require FDA pre-approval; however, an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) must agree that the study is of a non-significant risk. In addition, certain clinical investigations are exempted from IDE regulations including investigations of IVDs so long as certain criteria are met. The IDE regulations place specific requirements on sponsors and investigators of clinical studies including reporting to the FDA certain adverse events and recordkeeping to demonstrate compliance with the regulations. The FDA can conduct periodic, unannounced inspections of sponsors and investigators to evaluate compliance with the IDE regulations. Failure to comply with the IDE regulations can subject the sponsor and investigator to administrative enforcement proceedings, civil penalties, and/or criminal penalties.

We utilized the 510(k) and De Novo pathways to seek authorization from the FDA for those aspects of the PGS products that are medical devices. Specifically, the FDA granted our first De Novo authorization to market our PGS product for Over-the-Counter Carrier testing for Bloom Syndrome in February 2015. Since 2015, we received three additional FDA De Novo Authorizations for Over-the-Counter Genetic Health Risks, BRCA1/BRCA2 Selected Variants and Pharmacogenetic Metabolism Information as well as two FDA 510(k) Clearances for MUTYH and Pharmacogenetic Drug Response Information. The regulations governing our authorizations and clearances place substantial restrictions on how our PGS service is marketed and sold, specifically, requirements on pre-purchase information we must provide to consumers and special controls we must comply with due to the over-the-counter nature of our PGS service. We may develop new diagnostic products and services that are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, or make changes to our medical devices that trigger a premarket submission that requires clinical data. The regulatory review and approval process for medical devices can be costly, timely, and uncertain. This process may involve, among other things, successfully completing additional clinical trials and submitting a premarket 510(k) notice, De Novo submission, or filing a premarket approval application with the FDA. If premarket review is required by the FDA, there can be no assurance that our tests will be cleared, authorized, or approved on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, there can be no assurance that the claims we propose to the FDA for clearance, authorization, or approval will be cleared, authorized, or approved by the FDA.
 We consider certain of our Wellness reports and Polygenic Risk Score reports to be either not medical devices under the FDCA or to be medical devices subject to FDA enforcement discretion from compliance with the requirements of the FDCA in accordance with FDA’s General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices (issued July 29, 2016 and revised September 27, 2019). It is possible in the future that the FDA may disagree and conclude that some or all of our Wellness reports or Polygenic Risk Score reports are medical devices and not subject to enforcement discretion. As a result, we could be subject to enforcement action and penalties. We consider our COVID-19 Severity Calculator to be a medical device that is subject to FDA enforcement discretion in accordance with FDA’s Policy for Device Software Functions and Mobile Medical Applications (issued September 27, 2019). Using a risk-based approach, FDA’s policy established a group of software that meets the definition of a medical device but is subject to enforcement discretion from compliance with the requirements of the FDCA. It’s possible that the FDA may disagree that our COVID-19 Severity Calculator is subject to enforcement discretion and could thus subject us to an enforcement action and penalties. If this were to occur, we will likely have to utilize the premarket pathways described above or seek FDA authorization through the Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) pathway in order to market the COVID-19 Severity Calculator. If we utilize the EUA pathway, the authorization to market the software application will terminate once the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) declares the COVID-19 emergency over.


Both before and after a medical device is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations which can increase the cost of conducting our business. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices through periodic inspections. Specifically, these inspections evaluate our compliance with its QSR, among other FDA requirements. The QSR includes requirements related to the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, designing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storing, installing, and servicing of medical devices intended for human use. Our manufacturing operations, and those of our third-party finished device manufacturers, are required to comply with the QSR. QSR compliance is required for medical devices that are FDA approved and cleared, and generally required for medical devices exempt from FDA pre-market notification. The FDA conducts announced and unannounced periodic and on-going inspections of medical device manufacturers to determine compliance with the QSR. If in connection with these inspections the FDA believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures, it may issue inspectional observations on Form FDA-483 (“Form 483”) that would necessitate prompt corrective action. If the FDA determines that our response to the Form 483 is not adequate (e.g., the corrective action plan and/or objective evidence is insufficient), the FDA may issue a warning letter (which would similarly necessitate prompt corrective action) and/or proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action, including the imposition of operating restrictions, a ceasing of operations at one or more facilities, enjoining and restraining certain violations of applicable law pertaining to products, seizure of products, and assessing civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. The FDA could also require the entry of a consent decree of permanent injunction with us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”). Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively manufacturing, marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Corruption
 In situations involving healthcare providers employed by foreign state-funded institutions or national healthcare agencies, violation of the local anti-kickback law may also constitute a violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual, business entity or employee of a U.S. business entity from offering or providing, directly or through a third party, including the distributors we rely on in certain markets, anything of value to a foreign government official with corrupt intent to influence an award or continuation of business or to gain an unfair advantage, whether or not such conduct violates local laws. In addition, it is illegal for a company that reports to the SEC to have false or inaccurate books or records or to fail to maintain a system of internal accounting controls. We are also required to maintain accurate information and control over sales and distributors’ activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA, its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions.
Laboratory Certification, Accreditation and Licensing
 We and our third-party laboratories are also subject to U.S. and state laws and regulations regarding the operation of clinical laboratories. Virtually all clinical laboratories operating in the U.S. must be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency. Federal CLIA requirements regulated by the CMS and laws of certain states, including those of California, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Florida, impose certification requirements for clinical laboratories, and establish standards for quality assurance and quality control, among other things. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls, or require maintenance of certain records. CLIA provides that a state may adopt different or more stringent regulations than federal law and permits states to apply for exemption from CLIA if the state’s laboratory laws are equivalent to, or more stringent than, CLIA. For example, the State of New York’s clinical laboratory regulations, which have received an exemption from CLIA, contain provisions that are in certain respects more stringent than federal law. Therefore, as long as New York maintains a licensure program that is CLIA-exempt, we will need to comply with New York’s clinical laboratory regulations in order to offer our clinical laboratory products and services in New York. Standards for testing under CLIA are based on the complexity of the tests performed by the laboratory, with tests classified as “high complexity,” “moderate complexity,” or “waived.” Laboratories performing high-complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than moderate-complexity laboratories. Laboratories performing only waived tests, which are tests determined by the FDA to have a low potential for error and requiring little oversight, may apply for a certificate of waiver exempting them from most CLIA requirements.
 We have current certificates to perform clinical laboratory testing to offer our PGS in all 50 states. Clinical laboratories are subject to inspection by regulators and to sanctions for failing to comply with applicable requirements. The sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA requirements include suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business; cancellation or suspension of the laboratory’s approval to receive Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement; as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. States also have licensure requirements and may impose additional sanctions on us. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification, state license, imposition of a fine or other penalties, or future changes in CLIA and state law/regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Regulation of Consumer Products
 The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) also have jurisdiction over products offered by PGS (especially those aspects of our products that are not regulated by the FDA). The FTC requires that advertising claims be truthful, non-deceptive, fair, and adequately supported. The CPSC protects the American public from products that may present safety hazards, with labeling requirements, as well as reporting and remedial actions required if certain hazards or events are identified. Failure to comply with FTC and/or CPSC laws and implementing regulations could subject us to enforcement proceedings, including mandatory recalls and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on us.
International
 When marketing our PGS health reports outside of the U.S., we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing, export of biological or tissue samples, marketing approval for our products and performance and reporting of tests on a local basis. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the U.S. and may require us to perform additional preclinical or clinical testing. Marketing in Europe subjects us to European Union (“EU”) medical device oversight. Accordingly, we and certain of our contract manufacturers would be subject to ongoing compliance with various International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) standards and ongoing regulatory oversight and review. These include routine inspections by EU Notified Bodies, which are entities accredited by an EU Member State to assess whether a product to be placed on the market meets certain preordained standards, of our manufacturing facilities and our records for compliance with requirements such as ISO 13485 and ISO 27001, which establish extensive requirements for quality assurance and control as well as manufacturing and change control procedures. Additionally, the EU adopted the IVD Regulation (“IVDR”) which will increase the regulatory requirements applicable to IVDs in the EU and would require that we classify and obtain pre-approval for our PGS health reports, which would be subject to the IVDR as of May 25, 2022. If we are not able to obtain and maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our PGS health service and/or may be subject to enforcement by EU Competent Authorities, bodies with authority to act on behalf of the government of the applicable EU Member State to ensure that the requirements of the directive or regulation are met.
 As of January 1, 2021, due to the U.K. leaving the EU, the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ("MHRA") began implementation of new requirements for medical devices, including our health reports, marketed in Great Britain. The new regulations require that on or before January 1, 2022, we register with the MHRA, designate a U.K. Responsible Person and prior to June 30, 2023 obtain a United Kingdom Conformity Assessed mark for our health reports, which are Class I In Vitro Diagnostic Devices. Prior to that time, the U.K. will continue to allow marketing of our health reports pursuant to our existing CE mark.
 In situations involving healthcare providers employed by state-funded institutions or national healthcare agencies, violation of the local anti-kickback law may also constitute a violation of the FCPA. The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual, business entity or employee of a U.S. business entity from offering or providing, directly or through a third party, including the distributors we rely on in certain markets, anything of value to a foreign government official with corrupt intent to influence an award or continuation of business or to gain an unfair advantage, whether or not such conduct violates local laws. In addition, it is illegal for a company that reports to the SEC to have false or inaccurate books or records or to fail to maintain a system of internal accounting controls. We are also required to maintain accurate information and control over sales and distributors’ activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA, its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions.
Consumer (Telehealth) Business
 The practice of medicine is subject to various federal, state, and local certification and licensing laws, regulations, approvals and standards, relating to, among other things, the qualifications of the provider, the practice of medicine (including specific requirements relating to online or telephone consultations and the provision of remote care), the continuity and adequacy of medical care, the maintenance of medical records, the supervision of personnel, and the prerequisites for the prescription of medication and ordering of tests. Because the practice of telehealth is relatively new and rapidly developing, regulation of telehealth is evolving and the application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws, regulations and standards can be uncertain or uneven. As a result, we must continually monitor legislative, regulatory, and judicial developments regarding the practice of medicine and telehealth in order to support our PMCs.
 Physicians, mid-level providers (e.g., physician assistants, nurse practitioners), and behavioral health providers who provide professional clinical services via telehealth must, in most instances, hold a valid license to provide the applicable professional services in the state in which the patient is located. We have established systems to assist the PMCs in ensuring that their providers are appropriately licensed under applicable state law and that their provision of telehealth to our customers occurs in each instance in compliance with applicable rules governing telehealth.


In certain jurisdictions, the corporate practice of medicine doctrine generally prohibits non-physicians from practicing medicine, including by employing physicians to provide clinical services, directing the clinical practice of physicians, or holding an ownership interest in an entity that employs physicians. Other practices, such as professionals splitting their professional fees with non-professional persons or entities, is also prohibited in some jurisdictions. These laws are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or unduly influencing a physician’s professional judgment. State laws and enforcement activities related to the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting vary dramatically. In some states, even activities not directly related to the delivery of clinical services may be considered an element of the practice of medicine. For example, in some states the corporate practice of medicine restrictions may be implicated by non-clinical activities such as scheduling, contracting, setting rates, and the hiring and management of non-clinical personnel.
 Because of the restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine doctrine and fee-splitting in various jurisdictions, we do not employ the healthcare providers who provide clinical services on our telehealth platform. Instead, the PMCs provide services on the platform and we contract with but do not own the PMCs. We provide administrative, non-clinical services to the PMCs and bill them a fixed amount for those services, based on what we believe to be the fair market value of the services, pursuant to our contracts. The PMCs and their providers maintain exclusive authority regarding the provision of healthcare services (including consultations that may lead to the writing of prescriptions) and remain responsible for retaining and compensating their providers, credentialing decisions regarding their providers, maintaining professional standards, maintaining clinical documentation within medical records, establishing their own fee schedule, and submitting accurate information to us so that we can bill customers. Despite our care in structuring arrangements with the PMCs, it is possible that a regulatory authority or another party, including providers affiliated with PMCs, could assert that we (or other organizations with similar business models) are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that the contractual arrangements with PMCs violate a state’s fee-splitting prohibition. Failure to comply with these state laws could lead to materially adverse consequences for the Company.
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some state and federal regulatory authorities lowered certain barriers to the practice of telehealth in order to make remote healthcare services more accessible. Due to our business model, these changes did not dramatically change our operations, but these changes did introduce many people to the practice of telehealth. It is unclear whether these changes will have a long-term impact on the adoption of telehealth services by the general public or legislative and regulatory authorities.
 Regulation of Pharmacy Services
 Our pharmacy services are subject to laws of various state and federal agencies. Our affiliate pharmacies face regulation on a number of issues that vary from state-to-state, including pharmacist-to-technician supervision ratios, practice of pharmacy, quality, sufficiency of facilities and equipment, prescription requirements, patient-friendly medication labeling, controlled substance, scheduled listed chemical, and listed chemical regulation, and ensuring a patient’s freedom of choice in selecting their pharmacy, among a number of other requirements. On the federal level, pharmacies must comply with FDA’s requirements under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act which are intended to preserve the integrity of the U.S. drug supply chain. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act requires pharmacies and others in the U.S. drug supply chain to comply with requirements for product tracking and tracing, information and pedigree exchange, reporting, investigations, and product quarantine and disposition. Further federal regulations apply to those pharmacies that dispense controlled substances under the Controlled Substance Act, which is implemented by the Drug Enforcement Administration. For our affiliated retail pharmacy that accepts insurance reimbursement from government payors, further federal regulations, such as HIPAA (as defined below), the anti-kickback laws, and the federal False Claims Act apply, as well as regulations from additional state and federal agencies such as the DOJ and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Furthermore, each pharmacist and technician must also obtain appropriate professional licensure and are subject to upholding state professional standards of conduct and patient privacy laws.
Privacy and Security Regulation
 We are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with the requirements of numerous local, state, federal and international laws, rules, and regulations relating to the privacy and security of directly or indirectly identifiable personal information (collectively, “Data Protection Laws”). Such Data Protection Laws address the collection, storage, sharing, use, disclosure, processing, transferring, and protection of personal information, including genetic information, and evolve frequently in scope and enforcement. There can also be uncertainty, differing interpretations, and contradictory requirements across the privacy and security legal and regulatory landscape. In the U.S., some of the notable Data Protection Laws we are subject to include the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA,” previously known as the California Consumer Privacy Act or “CCPA”), the California Genetic Information Privacy Act (“GIPA”), Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”), the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”) and, in the event of a data breach, various data breach laws across the 50 states and territories. Recently, new U.S. state comprehensive Data Protection Laws have developed in response to the CPRA, such as the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”) and Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”). Outside of the U.S., numerous countries have their own Data Protection Laws, including, but not limited to, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) and the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), now also enacted in the U.K. (“UK GDPR”). 23andMe also expects new Data Protection Laws to be proposed and enacted in the future, particularly in the U.S., and current Data Protection Laws to evolve frequently through new legislation and amendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement. The effects of such changes may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another, and potentially far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses. These new or modified Data Protection Laws, and other changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, particularly any new or modified laws or regulations that require enhanced protection of certain types of data or new obligations with regard to data retention, transfer or disclosure, could greatly increase the cost of providing our offerings, require significant changes to our operations or even prevent us from providing certain offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate and in which we may operate in the future.
 Data Protection Laws are enforced by the FTC, government authorities and agencies, including state attorneys general and data protection commissioners. Data Protection Laws require us to publish statements to our customers that describe how we handle personal information and the choices customers have about the way we handle their personal information. If such information that we publish is considered untrue or inaccurate, we may be subject to claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices under Section 5 of the FTC Act or similar laws, which could lead to significant liabilities and consequences.
 In the U.S., the CPRA was recently approved by California voters, resulting in a significant modification of the CCPA and additional costs and expenses to our compliance efforts. The CPRA will create additional obligations relating to consumer data, with enforcement beginning on July 1, 2023. The CPRA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation and a private right of action in the event of a data breach. Interpretation and enforcement of CPRA, including its current and forthcoming regulatory guidance, remain uncertain. Other states are presenting similar comprehensive privacy laws, some of which are more robust than the CPRA in certain aspects. For example, in 2023 new consumer privacy laws will become effective in Colorado, Virginia, and Utah.
 Internationally, we are subject to, among other Data Protection Laws, the GDPR, UK GDPR, and PIPEDA which regulate collection, storage, sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information, and impose stringent requirements with significant penalties and litigation risks for noncompliance. Like the U.S., international Data Protection Laws include national, state or provincial, and local laws, meaning compliance costs increase with every state, province, or locale we ship to. Failure to comply with the GDPR (and the UK GDPR) may result in fines of up to 20 million Euros/£17.5 million or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the infringer, whichever is greater. It may also lead to civil litigation, with the risks of damages or injunctive relief, or regulatory orders adversely impacting the ways in which our business can use personal information. While Canada’s PIPEDA does not have as stringent requirements and fines as the GDPR at this time, Canadian legislators are actively working on reforms to PIPEDA to align it with the GDPR. We anticipate that any reforms to PIPEDA will further increase our compliance costs and liabilities.

Where applicable, we rely on data transfer mechanisms to be able to transfer data between countries freely. We previously relied on the Privacy Shield certification for the purposes of transferring personal information out of the EU. In light of the invalidation of Privacy Shield, we continue to rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer EU/UK personal information outside of the EU/UK, or where applicable derogations provided for by law. These clauses have been being revised, and the process and the implementation of new requirements related to the clauses, such as conducting additional risk assessments and implementing additional safeguards, will increase our costs. On March 25, 2022, the EU and U.S. announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework (the “Framework”), which will be translated into legal documents to be adopted in the EU and U.S. to provide a renewed basis for transatlantic data transfers. However, if a new Framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on the standard contractual clauses or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from the EU to the U.S., we will likely be unable to offer a number of services in the EU, which would materially and adversely affect our business. Additionally, in the U.S. and internationally, businesses are required to provide notice to affected customers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. Many countries and/or states require businesses to maintain safeguards and take certain actions in response to a data breach and may be required to also notify applicable regulatory authorities. Recently, some states, such as California, have explicitly added genetic information to their breach notification laws, which presents additional liabilities and costs to our business. Some U.S. states go beyond data breach notification and general security safeguards by requiring businesses to maintain specific security safeguards; for example, Massachusetts establishes minimum standards to be met in connection with the safeguarding of personal information contained in both paper and electronic records including maintaining security policies and procedures, security training for employees, regular audits. While many Data Protection Laws rely on regulatory enforcement for non-compliance with security safeguards or data breaches, there may be an increase in legislation like CPRA providing a private right of action for consumers in the event of a data breach. Civil litigation and security compliance present liabilities and costs with respect to maintaining and continually refining security safeguards and incident response processes.
 We anticipate changes with Data Protection Laws as countries and states continue to propose comprehensive privacy laws and regulations addressing consumer data protection rights, transparency and cybersecurity. In certain states, these laws are directed specifically to genetic information or genetic testing companies, or more specifically direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies. Data Protection Laws specific to genetic information have recently been enacted in a number of states, including, but not limited to, California, Utah, and Arizona. Many other states are considering similar laws regulating genetic information, some of which include private rights of action for consumers. Such private rights of action present liabilities and costs to our business with respect to implementing and maintaining compliance with such laws, and potentially responding to civil litigation. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with privacy, data protection and information security standards and protocols imposed by Data Protection Laws. With substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations (such as CPRA and genetic privacy laws), we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so.

Regulation of our Therapeutics Products and Programs
 Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, manufacture, testing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products, diagnostics, including those we are developing as well as any future drugs. Generally, before a new drug, biologic or diagnostic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved, authorized, or cleared by the applicable regulatory authority. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate regional, federal, state, territorial and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or following approval may subject an applicant to administrative actions or judicial sanctions. These actions and sanctions could include, among other actions, a regulatory agency’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license revocation, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, voluntary or mandatory product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of or debarment from government contracts, FDA debarment, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal fines or penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business, the market acceptance of our products and our reputation. Our drugs must be approved by the FDA through either a New Drug Application (“NDA”), or a Biologics License Application (“BLA”), process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S., and by similar processes for other regulatory regions. Moreover, the regulatory requirements governing our business are also evolving and will likely continue to evolve. By example, FDA has issued a number of guidance documents relating to gene therapies. Additionally, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA has issued a number of guidance documents to assist companies navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Future changes in legislation may also take place. For example, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act is due for reauthorization by September 2022, which may result in changes to any of the requirements and programs discussed below.
 Preclinical Studies
 Before testing any drug, biological, or gene therapy candidate in humans, the drug must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including Good Laboratory Practice ("GLP") regulations and requirements relating to animal testing. The sponsor submits the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA or other regulatory or oversight committee as part of an IND or Clinical Trial Application ("CTA"). In the U.S., an IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions and places the study on clinical hold. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. Clinical holds may also be imposed by the FDA during the conduct of trials due to safety or compliance concerns. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse effects and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
Clinical Trials
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB/ethics committee for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative as well as other subject communications and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. In the case of certain gene therapy studies, an Institutional Biosafety Committee (“IBC”) at the local level may also review and maintain oversight over the particular study, in addition to the IRB.
 There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Information about certain clinical trials, including clinical trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website or other comparable public trial registries. Sponsors of investigational products for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious disease or conditions must also have a publicly available policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access. Investigators must further provide certain information to clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. The data from the foreign clinical study must also be deemed by FDA to be meaningful to the U.S. population.
 Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap.
 •Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the drug. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, dosage tolerance, structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, absorption, excretion, pharmacokinetics side effect tolerability, and safety of the drug. These trials also sometimes seek to gain an early indication of a product candidate’s effectiveness.
 •Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to evaluate proof of concept and/or determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further PK and PD information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
 •Phase 3 clinical trials are adequate and well-controlled studies that involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.


Additional kinds of data may also help support a BLA or NDA, such as patient experience data and real-world evidence. Real world evidence may also be used to assist in clinical trial design or support an NDA for already approved products. For genetically targeted populations and variant protein targeted products intended to address an unmet medical need in one or more patient subgroups with a serious or life threatening rare disease or condition, the FDA may allow a sponsor to rely upon data and information previously developed by the sponsor or for which the sponsor has a right of reference, that was submitted previously to support an approved application for a product that incorporates or utilizes the same or similar genetically targeted technology or a product that is the same or utilizes the same variant protein targeted drug as the product that is the subject of the application.
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the relevant health authorities and IRBs. The sponsor must also notify relevant health authorities and the IRBs of adverse events or other significant safety information within specified timeframes. Certain reports may also be required to be submitted to the IBC. Changes to the enrollment of clinical trials, for example halting enrollment for a clinical safety signal, or completing expected clinical trial accrual may be reported on a clinical trial registration site such as clinicaltrials.gov and may provide publicly available information about the status of an ongoing clinical trial.
 Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, and other types of clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The health authority or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at institutions under its jurisdiction if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with their requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. IBCs can also require that research activities be ceased if applicable requirements are not being met. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group may monitor the continued safety of the study, provide recommendations on study continuation, and/or provide authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.
The manufacture of investigational drugs and biologics for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and biologics and active ingredients and therapeutic substances imported into the U.S. are also subject to regulation by the FDA. Further, the export of investigational products outside the U.S. is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drugs do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.


FDA Review Process
 Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational drug is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. The NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity and potency for a biologic. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a drug’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), as amended, each NDA or BLA subject to certain exceptions, must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA or original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA or original BLA designated for priority review, which are products that, if approved, would present significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for or a sponsor’s submission of additional information or clarification. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials and clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. The FDA will also inspect the facilities that manufacture the product candidate and will not approve a marketing application unless the agency confirms the manufacturer’s compliance with GMP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. For product candidates for which no active ingredient has previously been approved, such a referral is mandatory unless FDA issues an action letter summarizing the reasons why it did not require an advisory committee review.
The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. Even if approval is granted, the FDA may limit the approved product’s indications for use, require labeling with significant warnings, limitations, or contraindications, or place other conditions on the approval that restricts the ability to market the product. For instance, FDA may require post-approval testing or surveillance, or impose other restrictions on the product, including distribution restrictions or risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The FDA may also not approve label statements that are necessary for successful commercialization and marketing.
European Medicines Agency (EMA) Review Process
 In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union (including Norway and excluding Croatia), Iceland and Liechtenstein, drugs can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization (“MA”). Before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. There are two types of marketing authorizations:
 •The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union.
 •National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (“SPC”) and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. If there is another product approved by FDA for the same orphan indication, which FDA deems to be the same as the investigational product, the sponsor of the investigational product must also present a plausible hypothesis of clinical superiority for FDA to grant an orphan drug designation. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan drug exclusivity. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication. In such cases, the second in time product could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If we pursue marketing approval for an indication broader than any orphan drug designation we have received, we may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Moreover, whether a gene therapy product qualifies for orphan designation is an evolving area. FDA issued a final draft guidance document on how the agency will determine gene therapy product “sameness.” Pursuant to the guidance, “sameness” will depend on the product’s transgene expression, viral vectors groups and variants, and other product features that may have a therapeutic effect. Generally, minor differences between gene therapy products will not result in a finding that two products are different. Any FDA sameness determinations could impact our ability to receive approval and obtain or maintain orphan exclusivity.
 In the European Union, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). In the EU, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following drug approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.


Expedited Development and Review Programs
 A sponsor may seek to develop and obtain approval of its drugs under programs designed to accelerate the development, FDA review and approval of new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. For example, the FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite review of or facilitate development of new drugs and biologics that are intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. If fast track designation is obtained, sponsors may be eligible for more frequent development meetings and correspondence with the FDA. For a fast track-designated product, the FDA may consider sections of the NDA or BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA or BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting. A product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development or review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.
 Priority review means that, for a new molecular entity or original BLA, the FDA sets a target date for FDA action on the marketing application at six months after accepting the application for filing as opposed to ten months. A drug is eligible for priority review if it is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available drugs. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application for a new molecular entity or original BLA is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates an effect on either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the disease or condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. The product must also provide a meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA requires that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-approval confirmatory clinical trials. In addition, the FDA requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-review of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval using a streamlined process if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In recent years, the accelerated approval pathway has come under significant FDA and public scrutiny. Accordingly, FDA may become reluctant in granting accelerated approval or, if granted, may withdraw approval if clinical benefit is not confirmed.

Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved drugs on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to help the sponsor design a development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. The FDA may revoke breakthrough therapy designation if the Agency determines that the product no longer qualifies for this status, for example, if subsequent data does not confirm the clinical efficacy, or if another product addresses the previously serious condition.
 Another expedited pathway is the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation. Qualifying products must be a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or a combination of such products, and not a product solely regulated as a human cell and tissue product. The product must be intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that the product has the potential to address an unmet need for such disease or condition. Advantages of the RMAT designation include all the benefits of the Fast Track and breakthrough therapy designation programs, including early interactions with the FDA. These early interactions may be used to discuss potential surrogate or intermediate endpoints to support accelerated approval.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for full approval.
 Pediatric Information and Pediatric Exclusivity
 In the U.S., under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), certain NDAs and BLAs and certain supplements to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. PREA does not apply to products that have been granted orphan designation. However, PREA does apply if approval is sought for indications that are broader than or not covered by the orphan designation.
 The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 introduced an additional provision regarding required pediatric studies. Under this statute, for product candidates intended for the treatment of adult cancer which are directed at molecular targets that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of pediatric cancer, original application sponsors must submit, with the marketing application, reports from molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigations designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data, gathered using appropriate formulations for each applicable age group, to inform potential pediatric labeling. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals or waivers of some or all of this data, as above. Unlike PREA, orphan products are not exempt from this requirement.


A drug or biologic product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and, for drug products (as opposed to biologic products) any patent terms listed in FDA’s list of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, which is commonly known as the Orange Book. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of the applicable exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. To qualify for this exclusivity, the study must be completed in accordance with the Written Request and within specified time frames prior to the expiration of the underlying patents or market exclusivity periods that would be extended. The study is not required, however, to show that the product is safe or efficacious in pediatric populations.
 In the EEA, MAAs for new drugs must include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (“PDCO”). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all Member States of the European Union and trial results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension.
Post-Marketing Requirements
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse events, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit the change and/or obtain additional regulatory approval, for example, of a new supplementary NDA or BLA, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 Health authorities may also place other conditions on approvals, either at the time of approval or after, including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, restricted physician prescribing, or other elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.


FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Certain GMP deviations also require reporting to FDA. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and list the products produced at the facility. There are also continuing program user fees that product sponsors must pay. Recently, the information that must be submitted to FDA regarding manufactured products was expanded through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act to include the volume of drugs produced during the prior year. These facilities are also subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including recall. Once an approval is granted, the FDA may issue enforcement letters or withdraw the approval of the product if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the drug or biologic reaches the market. Corrective action could delay drug or biologic distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug or biologic, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; revisions to promotional material; the provision of corrective information; adverse publicity; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the drug or biologic, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the drug from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters, untitled letters, or cyber letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of drug or biologic approvals;
 •drug or biologic seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of drugs; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, FDA or contract debarment, refusal of orders under existing governmental contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, corporate integrity agreements and consent decrees, among other consequences described in this filing.
 New or modified laws, regulations, and requirements may also be passed that could delay or prevent FDA approval of our product candidates or otherwise negatively impact our commercial prospects. For example, in March 2020, the U.S. Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, which includes various provisions regarding FDA drug shortage and manufacturing volume reporting requirements, as well as provisions regarding supply chain security, such as risk management plan requirements, and the promotion of supply chain redundancy and domestic manufacturing. As part of the CARES Act implementation, the FDA issued a guidance on the reporting of the volume of drugs produced, which reporting will require additional administrative efforts by drug manufacturers.


Additional Biological and Gene Therapy Requirements
 To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the FDA statutes emphasize the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined and provides FDA with the authority to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the U.S. and between states.
 After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer.
 In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
 In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. Certain gene therapy studies are subject to the National Institutes of Health’s Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules. The FDA has also issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider during product development. These include guidance regarding preclinical and clinical studies; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls; the measurement of product potency; how FDA will determine whether a gene therapy product is the same as another product for the purpose of the agency’s orphan drug regulations; and long-term patient and clinical study subject follow up and regulatory reporting. FDA has also issued a guidance specific to gene therapy considerations during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as disease specific guidance.
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 Certain of our drugs may be regulated as biologics. An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCI Act”) as part of the ACA. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. The FDA has also issued a number of guidance documents outlining its approach to the review and approval of biosimilars, including guidance documents on the demonstration of interchangeability and the licensure of biosimilar and interchangeable products for fewer than all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use.
 Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials, absent a waiver from FDA. There further must be no difference between the reference product and a biosimilar in terms of mechanism of action, conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch.


A reference biological product is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, during which time FDA will not approve a biosimilar product. Moreover, FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the U.S. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor. The BPCI Act also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products.
 In addition to the above exclusivity periods, the BPCI Act also includes provisions to enable the settlement of potential patent disputes. The biosimilar product sponsor and reference product sponsor may exchange patent and product information to determine whether there should be a patent challenge. The reference product sponsor may be able to bring a patent infringement suit and injunction proceedings against the biosimilar product sponsor. The biosimilar applicant may also be able to bring an action for declaratory judgment concerning the patent.
 The FDA maintains a publicly available online database of licensed biological products, which is commonly referred to as the “Purple Book.” The Purple Book lists product names, dates of licensure, and applicable periods of exclusivity. Further, pursuant to an enacted statute to enable biological product patent transparency, the reference product sponsor must provide patent information and patent expiry dates to FDA following the exchange of patent information between biosimilar and reference product sponsors. This information is then published in the Purple Book.
 The Hatch-Waxman Act
 Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients to the site of action in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s drug or a method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. In an effort to clarify which patents must be listed in the Orange Book, in January 2021, Congress passed the Orange Book Transparency Act of 2020, which largely codifies FDA’s existing practices into the FDCA.


Upon submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application approval will not be made effective until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must send notice of the certification to the NDA and patent holders. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification, in which case the FDA may not make an approval effective until the earlier of 30 months from the patent or application owner’s receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent is favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation.
 The Hatch-Waxman Act establishes periods of regulatory exclusivity for certain approved drug products, during which the FDA cannot accept an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. The holder of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, may obtain five years of exclusivity upon approval of a new drug containing new chemical entities (“NCEs”) that have not been previously approved by the FDA. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
 The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity to the holder of an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) NDA) for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new indication or formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. This three-year exclusivity period protects against the FDA making an ANDA and 505(b)(2) NDA approval effective for the condition of the new drug’s approval. As a general matter, the three-year exclusivity does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic or modified versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
 Recently, Congress, the Administration, and administrative agencies have taken certain measures to increase drug and biologic competition by facilitating the entry of generic and biosimilar products to the market. For example, measures have been proposed and implemented to facilitate product importation. Congress also passed a bill requiring sponsors of NDA and BLA approved products to provide sufficient quantities of drug product on commercially reasonable market-based terms to entities developing generic, biosimilar, and 505(b)(2) products. This bill also included provisions on shared and individual REMS for generic drug products.


Patent Term Restoration
 If approved, drug and biologic products may also be eligible for periods of U.S. patent term restoration. If granted, patent term restoration extends the patent life of a single unexpired patent that has not previously been extended, for a maximum of five years. The total patent life of the product with the extension also cannot exceed fourteen years from the product’ approval date. Subject to the prior limitations, the period of the extension is calculated by adding half of the time from the effective date of an IND to the initial submission of a marketing application, and all of the time between the submission of the marketing application and its approval. This period may also be reduced by any time that the applicant did not act with due diligence.
Coverage and Reimbursement
 Successful commercialization of new drug products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for those drug products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drug products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. The availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford a drug product. Sales of drug products depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of drugs products are paid for by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors.
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular drug products and requiring payment of manufacturer rebates. In many countries, the prices of drug products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of drug products under such systems are substantially lower than in the U.S. Certain countries allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products initially, but either assess cost-benefit subsequently or monitor and control company profits. Accordingly, in markets outside the U.S., the reimbursement for drug products may be reduced compared with the U.S.
 In the U.S., the principal decisions about reimbursement for new drug products under federal healthcare plans are typically made by CMS, an agency within the HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new drug product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. New products may not be covered, and coverage and reimbursement levels for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor.


The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. Any negotiated prices for any of our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain, and, in addition, we may be required to pay significant Part D coverage gap discounts on certain Part D utilization. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
 For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the average manufacturer price (“AMP”) and Medicaid unit rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although under the current state of the law these newly eligible entities (with the exception of children’s hospitals) are not eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. As 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid unit rebate data, revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. Moreover, multiple federal enactments have established initiatives to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our drug candidates, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat are the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s drug could adversely affect the sales of our drug candidate. If third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis.
 For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 requires, as a condition of payment by certain federal agencies and the Medicaid program, that manufacturers of “covered drugs” (including all drugs approved under an NDA) enter into a Master Agreement and Federal Supply Schedule contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs through which their covered drugs must be offered for sale at a mandatory ceiling price calculated at a statutory discount to certain federal agencies, including the VA and Department of Defense.
 These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any drugs for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such drug is prescribed or used.


Outside of the U.S., the pricing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular drug to currently available drugs or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures.
 Regulation of Companion Diagnostics/Delivery Devices
 We believe that the success of certain of our drug candidates may depend, in part, on the development and commercialization of a companion diagnostic. Companion diagnostics are in vitro diagnostic devices that provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic. The use of a companion diagnostic is stipulated in the labeling of both the diagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic. Companion diagnostics may identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. As noted in the “Regulation of In Vitro (“IVD”) Diagnostics and Medical Devices” section above, the FDCA and its implementing regulations govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of medical devices which includes companion diagnostics. Unless exempt, companion diagnostics are subject to FDA premarket review before commercialization. Companion diagnostics are generally subject to the 510(k) or PMA regulatory pathways but where appropriate, can be authorized through the De Novo process.
 On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance document, for therapeutic products that depend on the use of a diagnostic test and where the diagnostic device is essential for the safe and effective use of the corresponding therapeutic product, the premarket application for the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared via a medical device regulatory pathway contemporaneously with the therapeutic, although the FDA recognizes that there may be cases when contemporaneous development may not be possible. However, in cases where a drug cannot be used safely or effectively without the companion diagnostic, the FDA’s guidance indicates it will generally not approve the drug without the approval or clearance of the diagnostic device. The FDA also issued a draft guidance in July 2016 setting forth the principles for co-development of an in vitro companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product. The draft guidance describes principles to guide the development and contemporaneous marketing authorization for the therapeutic product and its corresponding in vitro companion diagnostic. As noted in the “Regulation of In Vitro (“IVD”) Diagnostics and Medical Devices” section above, the companion diagnostic device is subject to FDA’s general controls including the QSR, facility registration, device listing, reporting of, adverse events, and reporting of corrections and removals. As a device manufacturer, companion diagnostic makers are subject to periodic FDA inspections. As noted in the “Regulation of In Vitro (“IVD”) Diagnostics and Medical Devices” section above, noncompliance with the FDCA and its implementing regulation can subject a manufacturer to enforcement including administrative actions, civil penalties, and criminal penalties.


To the extent a therapeutic drug or biologic product requires a delivery device (e.g., syringe), the delivery device will also be regulated as a medical device. Unless exempt, delivery devices are subject to FDA premarket review before commercialization as outlined in the “Regulation of In Vitro (“IVD”) Diagnostics and Medical Devices” section above. In addition to the traditional medical device regulatory pathway, the delivery device could also be authorized as a combination product with the therapeutic drug or biologic product. When authorized as a combination product, medical device quality system and adverse event reporting requirements still apply to the device portion of the combination product. However, the combination product manufacturer may be able to streamline some of these obligations in accordance with 21 C.F.R. Part 4.
 Other Laws—Environmental, Occupational Safety and Health
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.

Our focus areas at this time are on leadership development, career development, DE&I and supporting hybrid teams/leadership. Our flagship leadership program is for leaders at all levels (program, project, people, and/or team leaders), which provides employees to be able to lead from any seat. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, over 16% of all employees participated in this 4-month cohort based leadership program. We plan to continue to offer this program and support more employees through their leadership journey.
 Other talent development benefits we offer are tuition reimbursement, department learning budgets and internal mentorship programs. We recently launched our Company-wide BestYou@23andMe Framework, a performance management framework designed to support and foster career advancement. BestYou@23andMe encompasses three areas:
•The What - job responsibilities, objectives and key results (OKRs), Goals, DE&I; 
 •The How - Core Values, DE&I, Team Behaviors; and
 •Impact - for DE&I, on the Business, on the Company, for your citizenship.
 Our objective is having a clear approach towards career development, programs/benefits allowing employees with healthier lives, and an ability to participate in the community celebrating individuality. Our talent development programs are designed to support a work environment where employees are empowered to promote their unique perspectives.
