--------+------------------------

Overview
 
Oculus VisionTech Inc. (OVTZ) is a Canadian-based development-stage technology company focused on cyber security, data privacy and data protection solutions for Enterprise business customers. Headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the company was originally founded by image processing experts and is operated by experienced leadership. Currently, OVTZ is expanding and investing in a suite of new data protection and data privacy security products that will revolutionize CCPA, GDPR, LGPD and other data privacy legislation compliance for both data subjects and data controllers worldwide. Our mission is to provide intelligent software tools for continual enablement of data privacy and data protection for individuals, organizations and their customers worldwide, through a vision of mutually trusted data governance compliance.
 
Our Forget-Me-Yes® data privacy product is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform developed to specifically address the global ‘Right-to-be-Forgotten’ (RtbF) and Right-of-Erase (RoE) data subject deletion request legal compliance components of Brazil’s LGPD, Europe’s GDPR, California’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), China’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), Colorado’s Consumer Protection Act (CPA), Virginia’s Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) and Washington’s Privacy Act (WPA) regulations. Additional new data protection software tools are being developed to address public cloud data governance compliance globally. Our Cloud Document Protection System (Cloud-DPS) technology leverages our digital watermarking technology enabling OVTZ to offer a SaaS-based document management platform for tamper-proof document authentication and protection. Historically, we have used our digital watermarking technology for streaming video content distribution based on embedded digital watermarking, as well as video-on-demand (VOD) systems, services and source-to-destination digital media delivery solutions that allow live or recorded digitized and compressed video to be transmitted through Internet, intranet, satellite or wireless connectivity.
 
We were incorporated on April 18, 1986, as "First Commercial Financial Group Inc." in the Province of Alberta, Canada. In 1989, our name was changed to "Micron Metals Canada Corp.", which purchased 100% of the outstanding shares of USA Video Inc., a Texas corporation, in order to focus on the digital media business. In 1995, we changed our name to "USA Video Interactive Corp." and continued out of the Province of Alberta into the State of Wyoming. At a shareholders meeting held on December 30, 2011, a resolution was passed to change our name to "Oculus VisionTech Inc." and to alter our share capital by way of a reverse stock split (share consolidation) on the basis of fifteen old common shares for one new common share. On January 25, 2012, we changed our name to "Oculus VisionTech Inc." In June 2020, OVTZ acquired OCL Technologies Corp. (“OCL”), a Delaware corporation data privacy software development startup based in San Diego, California. As a 100% wholly-owned subsidiary of OVTZ and to better align with customer and market focus, OCL has completed a corporate name change to ComplyTrust® Inc. (“CTI”) on January 21, 2021. Any and all OCL references throughout this document are synonymous with the new name change, CTI.
 
Our executive and corporate headquarter offices are located at Suite 507, 837 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 3N6. Our telephone number is 1-800-684-0183 and our facsimile number is 604-685-5777. Our email address is contact@ovtz.com and our website is www.ovtz.com. Our common shares are listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSX.V – OVT, OTCQB – OVTZ, FSE – USF1).
 
Business Environment and Market Opportunity
 
In this age of digital transformation, data monetization, IoT, and massive data migration to converged hyperscale, geo-disbursed Cloud infrastructure and workloads, data protection and data privacy have taken center stage. GDPR, LGPD, CCPA, and many other new international (China, India) and upcoming US data privacy regulations enable individuals and organizations the right to access and request deletion of all personal information for a given data subject. In our ever increasing Everything-as-a-Service world, OVTZ recognizes the need for global cloud-native data privacy and data protection solutions that are multi-cloud platform-ready and can augment both existing legacy and newer agile-driven architectures. OVTZ is building modular microservices-based software solutions and services for both hybrid on-premise and multi-cloud data management that incorporate automated malware, privacy and ransomware scanning, reporting and visualization.

Our new Forget-Me-Yes® (FMY) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) data privacy solution is a highly-secure, Zero-Knowledge platform providing a single-source capability of continuous ‘right-to-be-forgotten’ (RtbF) and ‘right-of-erase’ (RoE) privacy compliance by incorporating automated policy-driven re-query services that guarantees a Data Subject’s requested RtbF/RoE data remains ‘forgotten’ over the life of their FMY subscription. FMY incorporates hybrid polymorphic encryption technology that ensures all User Interface, data-in-transit and data-at-rest remain secure and can only be accessed by the subscriber. With a cloud-native architecture, the FMY functionality can be utilized as either a complete turnkey SaaS subscription platform, or individually licensed for seamless integration with existing 3rd. party applications and data privacy platforms.
 
Our new ComplyTrust® Software-as-a-Service Suite (CTSS) is a set of software tools specifically designed to address cloud-native data management and regulatory compliant data governance. CTSS will help to remove enterprise organizational barriers and blockers to further enable successful cloud migration and deployment that benefit the cloud infrastructure providers, enterprise organizations, and users collectively. CTSS helps to automate and visualize cloud compliance reporting across accounts, regions and services based on a variety of user-definable and data driven metrics.
 
OVTZ had recognized that cloud-based, digital document security/protection products were a potentially viable business opportunity for the Company that allowed us to apply our proprietary real-time digital video watermarking technology, originally developed for studios and networks in the entertainment industry, to the digital document security/protection market. Cloud-DPS secures and protects digital documents (including text documents, photos, blueprints, etc.) from any modification, and/or attempted forgery by imperceptibly watermarking documents, using real-time image processing and watermarking algorithms, embedded into a secured/protected copy of a document. This authentication and verification process ensures the integrity of the original digital document.
 
Strategic Plan 
 
Our strategic plan is to first introduce the cloud-native Forget-Me-Yes® (FMY) data privacy SaaS platform under the AWS Web Services Cloud infrastructure on a monthly subscription basis for structured data. Initial release will include subscriber connections specific to Salesforce organizations with other connectors to be added over time, including but not limited to Hubspot, Marketo, Shopify, and more. Additional connectors for Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) providers for MySQL, NoSQL and SQL databases, for both structured and unstructured data, are also planned. Going forward, we plan to license FMY API microservices for integration with 3rd. party application partners, software providers and potential OEM’s. FMY’s cloud native enables it to be integrated and run under any on-premises, hybrid or alternative cloud infrastructure.
 
The ComplyTrust® SaaS Suite (CTSS) strategic plan for the data protection market is to first introduce Amazon Web Services (AWS) tools to help AWS customers better manage organizational data protection and compliance in an automated and cloud-native fashion. As customer attainment increases, additional planned CTSS features will be rolled out to perform additional applicable data governance and management functionality. Additional CTSS plans include integration with 3rd. party software providers to provide an automated single-pane-of-glass solution for enterprise organizations worldwide.
 
The Cloud-DPS plan is to re-evaluate the current potential addressable market and underlying architecture to determine next steps in the Cloud-DPS evolution, as it very well could become an additional component in the CTSS toolset. Limited past market adoption and revenues indicate the need for a new Cloud-DPS strategy going forward, stay tuned.
 
Proprietary Technologies 
 
Our Forget-Me-Yes® patent-pending process locates, organizes and manages Data Subject RtbF and RoE personal information for FMY subscribers in a secure, efficient and persistent way. Automated and schedule compliance enables organizations to avoid regulatory distraction to focus on core business competencies. Our FMY zero-knowledge 3rd. party audit features provide arguable good faith and best practices to avoid litigation, fines, penalties and potential brand damage associated with bad publicity surrounding a data privacy compliance infraction.

Our DPS technology ‘personalizes’ protected documents, based on their content, thereby creating a format invariant watermarking system. A document converted into a PDF document is encrypted before delivery, such that it cannot be opened without providing proper credentials. The result is that a document watermarking system can be offered as a cloud-based software service that can:
 

o | Protect - Accept any incoming document through a web portal, watermark it and return the watermarked document as a PDF document.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Authenticate - The "document authenticator" is also a cloud-based software service that can accept the watermarked document and validate the authenticity of the documents.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our DPS technology combines the access control security for electronic documents, forensic grade anti-tampering technology based on the document's content "understanding", and optional data storage into a single, unique solution. Because of its cloud-based scalable architecture, the DPS has potential to expand and grow into a complete document management, security and storage eco-system within the CTSS product suite, particularly in conjunction with FMY-specific unstructured data privacy scanning capabilities.

Acquisition of ComplyTrust Inc. (formerly OCL Technologies Corp.)
 
On June 5th, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of ComplyTrust Inc. (“CTI”), formerly OCL Technologies Corp. (“OCL”), www.ocltechnologies.com, a Delaware Corporation, with its head office located in the technology hub of San Diego, California. CTI is specifically focused on providing enterprise organizations and individuals with highly-secure data privacy tools that provide sustained and continuous global regulatory compliance of data subject rights, while independently protecting all parties. With the burgeoning growth of privacy regulation worldwide coupled with strict regulatory oversight, companies are dedicating significant resources to achieve and maintain compliance. In the past two years alone, initiatives such as the EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation effective May 25, 2018) as well as the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act passed June 28, 2018 and effective January 1, 2020) have mandated privacy rights and data protection for entities and individuals contemplated within their legislative frameworks. In addition to these, there are additional data privacy legislative initiatives on-going in Asia and both North and South America which will require data protection solutions. Oculus believes that the acquisition of CTI is a tremendous fit within its core objective of developing robust cutting edge technologies that address focused customer data protection requirements on a global scale.
 
    11 

  

Consideration for the acquisition of CTI was 12,500,000 common shares of the Company and 12,500,000 share purchase warrants exercisable for a period of five years from date of issuance. The share purchase warrants are exercisable only upon specific performance criteria being met. Such criteria being 1) revenue sales projections per CTI’s proformas, or 2) listing on a major US exchange, or 3) change of control as defined below:

Intellectual Property 
 
Our success is dependent, in part, upon our proprietary technology. We generally rely upon patents, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology products and services.
 
On June 19, 2001, United States Patent Application No. 09/884,787, "Method and Apparatus for Digitally Fingerprinting Videos", was officially filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This patent is for "MediaSentinel™". This patent expired in February of 2010. At this time, we have elected not to patent our Cloud-DPS technology until additional software development review is initiated to determine Cloud-DPS refresh requirements to be viable in today’s cloud-native world.
 
Patent-pending technology encompassing the Forget-Me-Yes® data privacy architecture includes our hybrid Zero-Knowledge data security process along with proprietary query engine and automated re-query services processes.
 
In October 2020, trademark applications were made by OVTZ for both Forget-Me-Yes® and ComplyTrust®, and were formally accepted and granted in November 2021. Additional trademark application was made for ComplyScanTM in August 2021.
 
Laws and Regulations
 
Our operations are or may be subject to various international, federal, provincial, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to the marketing of products and relationships with data protection, intellectual property protection, the export of technology products to certain countries and privacy protection. Although we believe that we are compliance with all international, federal, provincial, state and local regulations, the risk of claims and actions against us for breach of the aforesaid laws cannot be eliminated completely. In the event of a breach of these laws, we could be held liable for any damages that result. The amount of such damages could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Employees 
 
We currently have three employees, as we primarily engage independent contractors to provide services as necessary. Compensation for current and future work will be conducted on a contract basis. 
 
The loss of the services of any key management could have a materially adverse effect on the Company. We do not maintain key man life insurance on the life of its officers. In addition, our future success will depend in part upon its continuing ability to hire, train, motivate and retain key senior management and skilled technical and marketing personnel. Competition for technical personnel in the industry we compete in is intense. Our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to contract, assimilate and retain qualified personnel. To date, we have had limited success in recruiting qualified contractors, but there is no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future. Attracting qualified expertise is contingent on raising sufficient working capital and project advancement.

OCULUS VISIONTECH INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
 
NOTES TO  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 December 31, 2021 and 2020
(Stated in US Dollars) 
 

 
1. | BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND BUSINESS
---+-----------------------------------

   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Oculus Visiontech Inc. (“Oculus”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, ComplyTrust Inc. (“CTI”), formerly OCL Technologies Corp. (from the date of acquisition in 2020, Note 6). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. In the opinion of the management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for fair presentation have been included.   Oculus VisionTech, Inc. (the "Company") is a designer of digital watermarking services and solutions. At  December 31, 2021 and for the two-year period then ended, substantially all of the Company's assets and substantially all its operations are located and conducted in the United States and Canada.  

 
2. | GOING CONCERN
---+--------------

   The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. Management has forecasted the Company will have sufficient working capital to operate for the ensuing 12 months. As shown in the financial statements, the Company has incurred a loss of $1,986,665 for the year ended  December 31, 2021 and, in addition the Company incurred losses of $2,772,484 for the year ended  December 31, 2020. As of  December 31, 2021, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $46,145,845 and a working capital of $2,123,660. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations as they come due which management believes it will be able to do. To date, the Company has funded operations primarily through the issuance of common stock and warrants to outside investors and the Company’s management. The Company believes that its operations will generate additional funds and that additional funding from outside investors and the Company’s management will continue to be available to the Company when needed. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue as a going concern.   In  December 2019, a coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in China and in  January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In  March 2020, the WHO declared it a global pandemic. COVID-19 continued to spread globally, directly impacting worldwide economic activity and financial markets. The extent of the COVID-19 impact to future operational and financial performance will depend on the duration and spread of the outbreak, related public health measures, and their impact on the macroeconomy. While the Company expects this matter to negatively impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, the extent of the financial impact and duration cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, as none of these impacts can be predicted with certainty.  

 
3. | SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
---+-------------------------------------------

   Basis of consolidation
   These consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). On  March 21, 2022, the Board approved the consolidated financial statements dated  December 31, 2021.
   These consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and the entities controlled by the Company. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.   Control is defined as the exposure, or rights, to variable returns from involvement with an investee and the ability to affect those returns through power over the investee. Power over an investee exists when an investor has existing rights that give it the ability to direct the activities that significantly affect the investee’s returns. This control is generally evidenced through owning more than 50% of the voting rights or currently exercisable potential voting rights of a Company’s capital stock. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.     41OCULUS VISIONTECH INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
   NOTES TO  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  December 31, 2021 and 2020  (Stated in US Dollars) 
   The controlled entities are listed in the following table:

  Significant judgments, estimates and assumptions
   The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. These judgments, estimates and assumptions are regularly evaluated and are based on management’s experience and knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances. While management believes the estimates to be reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates and could impact future results of operations and cash flows.   The areas which require significant judgment and estimates that management has made at the financial reporting date, that could result in a material change to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, in the event actual results differ from the assumptions made, relate to, but are not limited to the following:   Significant judgments
 
● | the determination of functional currencies; and
--+------------------------------------------------

  Cash and cash equivalents
   Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of twelve months or less, and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes.   Impairment of long-lived assets and long-lived assets to be disposed of
   Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset  may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell.   Research and development 
   Expenditure on research activities is recognized on the consolidated statement of loss and comprehensive loss as incurred. Development expenditures are capitalized as part of the cost of the resulting intangible asset only if the expenditures can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Company intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. Management determined that as at  December 31, 2021, it was not yet able to demonstrate with sufficient certainty that it is probable that any economic benefits will flow to the Company. Accordingly, all research and development costs incurred to date have been expensed.   Intangible asset
   Identifiable intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is valued at fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.   The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.      
42
  
  OCULUS VISIONTECH INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
   NOTES TO  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  December 31, 2021 and 2020  (Stated in US Dollars) 
   Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset  may be impaired. The amortization period and method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in profit or loss.   Intangible assets with indefinite lives are measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. These intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if there are indicators that intangible assets  may be impaired.   Income taxes
   The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Current income taxes are the expected taxes payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to taxes payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under the asset and liability method, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be recognized.   Net loss per share
   Basic loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or contracts that  may require the issuance of common shares in the future were converted, unless the impact is anti-dilutive. For the year ended  December 31, 2021 and 2020, this calculation proved to be anti-dilutive, and therefore the Company’s 5,315,000 (2020: 3,850,000) stock options and 4,900,000 (2020: 4,900,000) warrants were excluded from the calculation.   Right of use asset
   The Company recognizes a right of use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right of use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.   The right of use assets are subsequently amortized from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right of use asset or the end of the lease term using the straight line method.   Lease liability
   The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.   Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following payments during the lease term: fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), and the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.   The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising mainly if the Company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, renewal or termination option, or if there is a revised in substance fixed lease payment.

   NOTES TO  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  December 31, 2021 and 2020  (Stated in US Dollars) 
   When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right of use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right of use asset has been reduced to zero.   Stock-based compensation
   The Company follows the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification Section 718 “Compensation - Stock Compensation”, which establishes accounting for equity-based compensation awards to be accounted for using the fair value method. Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements are initially measured at fair value at the date of grant and recorded within shareholders’ equity. Arrangements considered to be cash-settled are initially recorded at fair value and classified as accrued liabilities, and subsequently re-measured at fair value at each reporting date. The Company’s stock option plan is an equity-settled arrangement.   The fair value at grant date of all share-based payments is recognized as compensation expense over the period for which benefits of services are expected to be derived, with a corresponding credit to shareholders’ equity or accrued liabilities depending on whether they are equity-settled or cash-settled. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and estimate the expected forfeiture rate at the date of grant.   Functional currency
   The Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, which is the Company’s reporting currency. The functional currency of Oculus VisionTech Inc. is the Canadian (“CAD” or “C”) dollar and the functional currency of ComplyTrust Inc. is the U.S. dollar.   In accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, for companies that have a functional currency other than the US dollar, the Company translates the assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars using the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and the statements of operations and comprehensive loss and cash flows are translated at an average rate during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation from CAD into U.S. dollars are recorded in shareholders' equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss.   Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the respective currency of the entity or division, using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions (spot exchange rate). Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the re-measurement of monetary items denominated in foreign currency at period-end exchange rates are recognized in profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are not re-translated at period end are measured at historical cost (translated using the exchange rates at the transaction date), except for non-monetary items measured at fair value, which are translated using the exchange rates as at the date when fair value was determined. Gains and losses are recorded in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss.   Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
   Accounting Standards Update No. 2019-12—Income Taxes (Topic 740). In  December 2019, the FASB issued guidance intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes and removes certain exceptions to the general principles and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The Company adopted the standard on  January 1, 2021 and adoption had no impact on the Company’s financial statements.   Recently issued accounting pronouncements
   Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13—Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. In  June 2016, the FASB issued guidance intended to change how companies account for credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade receivables, loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, companies will be required to estimate lifetime expected credit losses and recognize an allowance against the related instruments. For available for sale debt securities, companies will be required to recognize an allowance for credit losses rather than reducing the carrying value of the asset. The adoption of this update, if applicable, will result in earlier recognition of losses and impairments.

   Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-19—Codification Improvements to ASC 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses. In  November 2018, the FASB introduced guidance on an expected credit loss methodology for the impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost basis. That methodology replaces the probable, incurred loss model for those assets. ASU 2018-19 is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2018-270, which has been deleted. Additionally, the amendments clarify that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of Subtopic 326-20. Instead, impairment of receivables arising from operating leases should be accounted for in accordance with ASC 842, Leases.   These updates are effective beginning  January 1, 2023, and the Company is currently evaluating ASU 2016-13 and ASU 2018-19 and the potential impact of adopting this guidance on its financial reporting.
