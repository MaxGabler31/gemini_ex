ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General
We are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural, consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions, applications and market-leading products. We operate in two distinct business segments: FMC Agricultural Solutions and FMC Lithium. Our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment develops, markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals: insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. These products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects, weeds and disease, as well as in non-agricultural markets for pest control. Our FMC Lithium segment manufactures lithium for use in a wide range of lithium products, which are used primarily in energy storage, specialty polymers and chemical synthesis application.
DuPont Crop Protection Business
On March 31, 2017, we entered into a definitive Transaction Agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) with E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (“DuPont"). On November 1, 2017, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreement, we completed the acquisition of certain assets relating to DuPont's Crop Protection business and research and development organization ("DuPont Crop Protection Business") (collectively, the "DuPont Crop Protection Business Acquisition"). In connection with this transaction, we sold to DuPont our FMC Health and Nutrition segment and paid DuPont $1.2 billion in cash. Our FMC Health and Nutrition business and its results have been presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented throughout this document.
Cheminova A/S
On April 21, 2015, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, we completed the acquisition of 100 percent of the outstanding equity of Cheminova A/S, a Denmark Aktieselskab ("Cheminova") from Auriga Industries A/S, a Denmark Aktieselskab for an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion, excluding assumed net debt and hedged-related costs of approximately $0.6 billion (the “Acquisition”). 
At December 31, 2016, we had substantially completed the integration of Cheminova into our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment.
FMC Strategy
FMC has streamlined its portfolio over the past seven years to focus on technology-driven end markets with attractive long-term demand trends. The actions we have taken over the past year have better positioned each of our businesses to capitalize on future growth opportunities.
2017 was a pivotal year for FMC Agricultural Solutions, as we acquired a significant portion of the DuPont Crop Protection Business to transform FMC into a tier-one leader and the fifth largest global provider in the agricultural chemicals market. The acquisition included DuPont’s industry-leading insecticides and herbicides (the majority of which are patented technologies), exceptional discovery research capabilities and a global manufacturing network. FMC’s legacy business also had a strong year, as it reaped the benefits of proactive measures taken in 2015 and 2016 to outperform the market in another challenging year for crop chemical providers. FMC will begin launching its legacy technology pipeline of eight new active ingredients, starting with our bixafen fungicide launch in North America targeted for early 2019. We also launched about 50 new legacy product formulations in 2017, which is key to life cycle management of our products. The DuPont Crop Protection Business Acquisition added 15 discovery leads to our pipeline, and as a result of the acquisition, we expect to spend approximately 8 percent of FMC Agricultural Solutions sales on research and development annually. FMC acquired 14 manufacturing plants from DuPont, and with 26 total plants today, we have the scale to operate this business with greater resources and global reach to address changing market conditions.
FMC is one of the leading global producers of specialty lithium products, and 2017 was a year of significant growth for FMC Lithium. In March, we announced our intention to separate FMC Lithium into a publicly traded company during 2018. We took an important step in December, when we finalized new operating agreements in Argentina. The provincial government of 
4

Catamarca formalized these agreements by passing legislation that sets our royalty rates and our commitments to corporate social responsibility programs, while also paving the way for us to expand capacity. As an independent company, FMC Lithium will have a focused investor base and strong balance sheet, ensuring it has the financial capacity to pursue its growth plans and be a leading force in this critical industry. We made several strategic decisions during the last few years to focus FMC Lithium on downstream, higher-value products. We convert most of our lithium carbonate and chloride production into high-purity materials, including lithium hydroxide used in electric vehicle ("EV") batteries, and butyllithium and lithium metals for specialty applications. In 2017, we expanded capacity in multiple locations, including a new lithium hydroxide plant in China that can produce 9,000 metric tons per year to meet accelerating demand for FMC’s products. Commercial sales from this facility began in June, and we had full commercial production for the final four months of 2017. We remain on track to reach 30,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide manufacturing capacity by the end of 2019, by adding another 12,000 metric tons of capacity. To feed these downstream products, we also announced plans to more than double lithium carbonate production at our Argentina site to approximately 40,000 metric tons per year by 2022. In addition, debottlenecking projects at our major facilities are contributing to short-term capacity increases. We will also continue to invest in other higher growth, higher value segments of the lithium market, including butyllithium for use in chemical synthesis and high purity lithium metal for aerospace and energy storage applications.
We maintain our commitment to enterprise sustainability, including responsible stewardship. As we grow, we will do so in a responsible way. Safety and business ethics will remain of utmost importance. Meeting and exceeding our customers’ expectations will continue to be a primary focus.

FMC Agricultural Solutions
            
Overview
    
6

Our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment, which represents approximately 88 percent of our 2017 consolidated revenues, operates in the agrochemicals industry. This segment develops, manufactures and sells a portfolio of crop protection, professional pest control and lawn and garden products. 
Products and Markets

FMC Agricultural Solutions' portfolio is comprised of three major pesticide categories: insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. The majority of our product lines consist of insecticides and herbicides, and we have a small but fast-growing portfolio of fungicides mainly used in high value crop segments. Our insecticides are used to control a wide spectrum of pests, while our herbicide portfolio primarily targets a large variety of difficult-to-control weeds. We are also investing substantially in a plant health program that includes biological crop protection products, seed treatments and micronutrients.
In the Latin American region, which includes the large agricultural market of Brazil, we sell directly to large growers through our own sales and marketing organization, and we access the market through independent distributors. In North America, we access the market through several major national and regional distributors and have our own sales and marketing organization in Canada. With the 2015 acquisition of Cheminova, we now access the European markets through our own sales and marketing organizations. With the 2017 acquisition of the DuPont Crop Protection Business, we now access key Asian markets through large distributors, in addition to either local independent distributors or our own sales and marketing organizations. Through these and other alliances, along with our own targeted marketing efforts, access to novel technologies and our innovation initiatives, we expect to maintain and enhance our access in key agricultural and non-crop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively.
Industry Overview 
The three principal categories of agricultural and non-crop chemicals are: herbicides, insecticides and fungicides, representing approximately 42 percent, 28 percent and 27 percent of global industry revenue, respectively.
The agrochemicals industry is relatively consolidated but further consolidation is likely as several of the leading crop protection companies are actively pursuing merger opportunities. Leading crop protection companies FMC, Syngenta AG, Bayer AG, Monsanto Company, BASF AG, DowDuPont, and Adama currently represent approximately 74 percent of the industry’s global sales. The next tier of agrochemical producers include Sumitomo Chemical Company Ltd., Nufarm Ltd., Platform Specialty Products Corporation, and United Phosphorous Ltd. FMC employs various differentiated strategies and competes with unique technologies focusing on certain crops, markets and geographies, while also being supported by a low-cost manufacturing model.
Growth
The 2017 acquisition of a significant portion of the DuPont Crop Protection Business positions FMC among leading agrochemical producers in the world. The acquired insecticides are predominantly based on patent-protected active ingredients and are growing well above market patterns. Our complementary technologies will lead to improved formulation capabilities and a broader innovation pipeline, resulting in new and differentiated products. We will take advantage of enhanced market access positions and an expanded portfolio to deliver near-term growth.
We will continue to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and acquiring, accessing, developing, marketing, distributing and/or selling complementary chemistries and related technologies in order to strengthen our product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers.
Our growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible and sustainable solutions that can effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide cost-effective alternatives to chemistries which may be prone to resistance. We are committed to providing unique, differentiated products to our customers by acquiring and further developing technologies as well as investing in innovation to extend product life cycles. Our external growth efforts include product acquisitions, in-licensing of chemistries and technologies and alliances that bolster our market access, complement our existing product portfolio or provide entry into adjacent spaces. We have entered into a range of development and distribution agreements with other companies that provide access to new technologies and products which we can subsequently commercialize.
FMC Lithium 
7



Overview 
Our FMC Lithium segment represents 12 percent of our 2017 consolidated revenues.
While lithium is sold into a variety of end markets, we have focused our strategy on specialty products that require a high level of manufacturing and technical know-how to meet customer requirements.
Lithium is a critical element in advanced batteries for use in hybrid electric, plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles. The electrochemical properties of lithium make it an ideal material for portable energy storage, including EVs, smart phones, tablets, laptop computers, military devices and other energy storage technologies. 
Organolithium products are highly valued in the polymer market as initiators in the production of synthetic rubbers and elastomers. Organolithiums are also sold to fine chemical and pharmaceutical customers who use lithium's unique chemical properties to synthesize high value-added products.
Industry Overview
    
FMC Lithium serves a diverse group of markets. Our product offerings are primarily inorganic and generally have few cost-effective substitutes. A major growth driver for lithium in the future will be the rate of adoption of electric vehicles.

Most markets for lithium chemicals are global with significant growth occurring both in Asia and North America, primarily driven by the development and manufacture of lithium ion batteries. There are three key producers of lithium compounds: FMC, Albemarle Corporation (previously Rockwood Holdings, Inc.) and Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. In addition to these producers, Orocobre is ramping up production from its brine source in Argentina and several Chinese producers convert lithium containing hard rock concentrates sourced from Australia into lithium compounds. We expect additional capacity to be added by new and existing producers for the next several years. FMC and Albemarle Corporation are the primary producers of specialty lithium products.
Source and Availability of Raw Materials
Raw materials used by FMC Agricultural Solutions, primarily processed chemicals, are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide. We extract ores used in FMC Lithium’s manufacturing processes from lithium brines in Argentina. 
Patents
We own and license a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property that are cumulatively important to our business. The FMC intellectual property estate provides us with an important competitive advantage. Our patents cover many of our products, processes and product uses as well as many aspects of our research and development activities. Patents are granted by individual jurisdictions and the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions. We also own many trademarks that are well recognized by customers or product end-users. Unlike patents, ownership rights in trademarks do not expire so long as the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected - we actively monitor and manage our trademarks to maintain such protection. We believe that the invalidity or loss of any particularly significant patent, trademark or license would be a remote possibility and/or would not likely have a material adverse effect on the overall business of FMC.
We own a number of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to our business. We do not believe that the loss of any individual or combination of related patents, trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of FMC. The duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions.
Seasonality
The seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the FMC Agricultural Solutions business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings among geographic locations. FMC Agricultural Solutions' products sold in the northern hemisphere (North America, Europe and parts of Asia) serve seasonal agricultural markets from March through September, generally resulting in earnings in the first, second and third quarters. Markets in the southern hemisphere (Latin America and parts of the Asia Pacific region, including Australia) are served from July through February, generally resulting in earnings in the third, fourth and first quarters. The remainder of our business is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations.
Competition
We encounter substantial competition in each of our two business segments. We market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners, independent distributors and sales representatives. The number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment. In general, we compete by providing advanced technology, high product quality, reliability, quality customer and technical service, and by operating in a cost-efficient manner.
Our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. Industry products include crop protection chemicals and, for certain major competitors, genetically engineered (crop biotechnology) products. Competition from generic agrochemical producers is significant as a number of key product patents held industry-wide have expired in the last decade. In general, we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development, including novel formulations, proprietary mixes, and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing (mostly) proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus. We also differentiate ourselves by our global cost-competitiveness through our manufacturing strategies, establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions.
Our FMC Lithium segment sells lithium-based products worldwide. We and our two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithium-rich brines located in the Andes Mountains of Argentina and Chile, which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium.
Research and Development Expense
We perform research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the FMC Agricultural Solutions segment. The development efforts in the FMC Agricultural Solutions segment focus on developing environmentally
