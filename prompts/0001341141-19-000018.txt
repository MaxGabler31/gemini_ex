ITEM 1.BUSINESS
General 
CatchMark Timber Trust, Inc. ("CatchMark Timber Trust") (NYSE: CTT) owns and operates timberlands located in the United States and has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. CatchMark Timber Trust acquires, owns, operates, manages, and disposes of timberland directly, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, or through joint ventures. CatchMark Timber Trust was incorporated in Maryland in 2005 and commenced operations in 2007. CatchMark Timber Trust conducts substantially all of its business through CatchMark Timber Operating Partnership, L.P. (“CatchMark Timber OP”), a Delaware limited partnership. CatchMark Timber Trust is the general partner of CatchMark Timber OP, possesses full legal control and authority over its operations, and owns 99.99% of its common partnership units. CatchMark LP Holder, LLC (“CatchMark LP Holder”), a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of CatchMark Timber Trust, is the sole limited partner of CatchMark Timber OP and owns the remaining 0.01% of its common partnership units. In addition, CatchMark Timber TRS, Inc. (“CatchMark TRS”), a Delaware corporation formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of CatchMark Timber OP in 2006, is our taxable REIT subsidiary. Unless otherwise noted, references to CatchMark, "we", "us", or "our" herein include CatchMark Timber Trust and all of its subsidiaries, including CatchMark Timber OP, and the subsidiaries of CatchMark Timber OP, including CatchMark TRS.
We primarily engage in the acquisition, ownership, operation, management, and disposition of timberland properties located in the United States. We generate recurring income and cash flow from the harvest and sale of timber, as well as from non-timber related revenue sources, such as asset management fees and rent from hunting and recreational leases. When and where we believe appropriate, we also generate income and cash flow from timberland sales. In addition to current income, we expect to realize long-term returns from the biological growth of our standing timber inventory. 
We strive to deliver superior, consistent, and predictable per share cash flow growth through disciplined acquisitions, active management, sustainable harvests, and well-timed real estate sales. We intend to grow over time through selective acquisitions and investments in high demand fiber markets and to efficiently integrate new acquisitions and investments into our operations. Operationally, we focus on generating cash flows from sustainable harvests and improved harvest mix on high-quality industrial timberlands, as well as opportunistic land sales and asset management fees to provide recurring dividends to our stockholders. We continue to practice intensive forest management and silvicultural techniques that increase the biological growth of our forests.
We also seek to create additional value by entering into joint ventures with long-term, institutional equity partners to opportunistically acquire, own, and manage timberland properties that fit our core investment strategy. In April 2017, we entered into our first joint venture with MPERS (the "Dawsonville Bluffs Joint Venture"). In July 2018, we entered into a joint venture (the "Triple T Joint Venture") with a consortium of institutional investors (the “Preferred Investors”), including BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group, Highland Capital Management, Medley Management Inc., and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation. Our joint venture platform drives growth through our fee-based management business that leverages our scale and timberland management efficiencies. 
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our revenues from timber sales, timberland sales, asset management fees, and other non-timber related sources, as a percentage of our total revenue, are set forth in the table below:

Current Timberland Holdings
As of December 31, 2018, we wholly owned interests in approximately 463,100 acres of high-quality industrial timberlands consisting of 19.8 million tons of merchantable timber inventory. Of the wholly-owned timberlands, 445,000 acres were located in six states in the U.S. South and 18,100 acres were located in Oregon. Our timberlands have been intensively managed for sustainable commercial timber production and are located within attractive and desirable fiber baskets encompassing a diverse group of pulp, paper and wood products manufacturing facilities. 
In addition to our wholly-owned timber assets, as of December 31, 2018, we owned a common limited partnership interest in the Triple T Joint Venture, which owns 1.1 million acres of high-quality industrial East Texas timberlands with approximately 42.9 million tons of merchantable timber inventory, and we owned a 50% membership interest in the Dawsonville Bluffs Joint Venture, which owns approximately 5,000 acres of high-quality commercial timberlands located in North Georgia with approximately 0.3 million tons of merchantable timber inventory.
Please refer to Item 2 – Properties for more details on our timber and timberland properties. 
Our Business and Growth Strategies
Our objective is to produce cash flow and value growth through the ongoing implementation of the following business and growth strategies: 
Actively Manage Our Timberlands for Long-Term Results. We seek to maximize long-term returns by actively managing our timberlands to achieve an optimum balance among biological timber growth, current harvest cash flow, and responsible environmental stewardship. Further, we expect to continue making investments in forest technology, including improved seedlings, in order to increase the sustainable yield of our timberlands over the long-term.

Maximize Profitability on Timber Sales. We actively manage our log merchandising efforts together with delivered and stumpage sales with the goal of achieving the highest available price for our timber products. We compete with other timberland owners on the basis of the quality of our logs, the prices of our logs, our reputation as a reliable supplier, and our ability to meet customer specifications. We will continue to work diligently and proactively with our third-party contractors with a view towards optimizing our logging, hauling, sorting, and merchandising operations to extract the maximum profitability from each of our logs based on the foregoing considerations. 
Pursue Attractive Timberland Acquisitions. We seek to identify and acquire high-quality industrial timberland properties, with our average deal size ranging from 10,000 to 40,000 acres. Critical evaluation of prospective property acquisitions is an essential component of our acquisition strategy. When evaluating acquisition opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the prospective timberland property or properties, including, but not limited to:
•Local market dynamics (supply/demand balance);

• | Predominantly softwood merchantable inventory mix;


• | Merchantable inventory/mix (tons per-acre);


• | Sustainable productivity (on a tons per-acre, per-year basis);


• | Quality of existing and prospective customers; and


• | Target cash yields (near-term/long-term).

We expect our transaction pipeline to continue to be driven by term liquidations by closed-end timber funds and overall portfolio rebalancing by other private timberland owners. 
We may enter into additional fiber supply agreements with respect to acquired properties in order to ensure a steady source of demand for our incremental timber production. 
Opportunistically Sell Timberland Assets. We continuously assess potential alternative uses of our timberlands, as some of our properties may be more valuable for development, conservation, recreational or other rural purposes than for growing timber. We intend to capitalize on the value of our timberland portfolio by opportunistically monetizing timberland properties. When evaluating our land sale opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the timberland property or properties, including, but not limited to:

• | Inventory stocking below portfolio average;


• | Predominantly hardwood merchantable inventory mix; and


• | Poor productivity.

The close proximity of our existing timberlands to several major population centers provides us with opportunities to periodically sell parcels of our land at favorable valuations. We generally expect to monetize 1% to 2% of our fee timberland acreage on an annual basis pursuant to our land sales program, although such results may vary. We may also decide to pursue various land entitlements on certain properties in order to realize higher long-term values on such properties.
Create Value Through Joint Ventures. We seek to create additional value through institutional equity joint ventures to acquire, own, and manage timberland properties that meet our core investment strategy. The timberland properties acquired through the Triple T Joint Venture and the Dawsonville Bluffs Joint Venture fit our profile for high quality assets with excellent stocking. The Triple T Joint Venture offers potentially significant investment returns through incentive-based promotes and attractive long-term, sustainable growth from high-quality timberlands. Our investment in the Dawsonville Bluffs Joint Venture has generated significant earnings and cash flows. Additionally, we have established and expanded our investment management business by managing the day-to-day operations of both joint ventures and earning asset management fee income, which support our dividend and growth strategy.

Practice Sound Environmental Stewardship. We remain committed to responsible environmental stewardship and sustainable forestry. Our wholly-owned timberlands, except those that have been recently acquired, and timberlands held by the Triple T Joint Venture, have been third-party audited and certified in accordance with the 2015-2019 SFI standards. We are currently taking the necessary procedures to get our recently acquired timberlands third-party audited and certified in accordance with the SFI standards within the next 12 months. SFI standards promote sustainable forest management through recognized core principles, including measures to protect water quality, biodiversity, wildlife habitat and at-risk species. Our timberlands are further managed to meet or exceed all state regulations through the implementation of best management practices as well as internal policies designed to ensure compliance. We believe our continued commitment to environmental stewardship will allow us to maintain our timberlands’ productivity, grow our customer base, and enhance our reputation as a preferred timber supplier. 
Financing Strategy
Our long-term financing strategy seeks to maximize balance sheet liquidity and operational flexibility for the purpose of generating current income and attractive long-term returns for our stockholders. We intend to employ prudent amounts of debt and equity financing as a means of providing additional funds for the selective acquisitions of timber assets, to refinance existing debt, or for general corporate purposes. In particular, we seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility by:

• | Maintaining sufficient liquidity through borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and cash-on-hand;


• | Minimizing the amount of near-term debt maturities in a single year;


• | Maintaining low to modest leverage;


• | Managing interest rate risk through an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt instruments, either directly or using interest rate swaps, caps or other arrangements; and


• | Maintaining access to diverse sources of capital.

We determine the amount of debt and equity financing to be used when acquiring an asset by evaluating terms available in the credit markets (such as interest rate, repayment provisions and maturity), our cost of equity capital, and our assessment of the particular asset’s risk. Historically, a significant portion of our debt has consisted of long-term borrowings secured by our timber assets. 
We anticipate that we will continue to use a number of different sources to finance our operations and selective acquisitions going forward, including cash from operations, proceeds from asset dispositions, funds available under bank credit facilities (which may or may not be secured by our assets), co-investments through partnerships or joint ventures, potential future issuances of common or preferred equity or partnership interests in our operating partnership or any combination of these sources, to the extent available to us, or other sources that may become available from time to time. 
Transaction Activities
We executed the following timberland transactions during the three years ended December 31, 2018:
Acquisitions
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we acquired 18,100 acres, 19,600 acres, and 81,900 acres of timberlands, respectively, totaling 119,600 acres. The properties acquired are well stocked with merchantable pine inventory, located in strong pulpwood and sawtimber markets, and complement our existing timberland portfolio. Together, they added 5.7 million tons to our merchantable timber inventory, averaging 48 tons per acre, comprised of 75% pine plantations by acreage and 55% sawtimber by tons. Our timberland ownership expanded into the Pacific Northwest in 2018.

On July 6, 2018, we invested $200.0 million in the Triple T Joint Venture in exchange for a common limited partnership interest, exclusive of transaction costs. The Triple T Joint Venture acquired 1.1 million acres of East Texas industrial timberlands (the "Triple T Timberlands") for approximately $1.39 billion. The Triple T Timberlands contained approximately 38.0 million tons of merchantable timber inventory as of the date of acquisition. In April 2017, we entered into the Dawsonville Bluffs Joint Venture which acquired a portfolio of 11,000 acres of commercial timberlands located in North Georgia for an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million, exclusive of transaction costs. 
Land Sales
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we sold 8,500, 7,700, and 7,300 acres of timberland, respectively. These land sales represented approximately 1.8%, 1.7%, and 1.7%, respectively, of our average fee timberland acreage (based on average quarterly fee timberland acreage) for each year. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the disposed timberlands had an average merchantable timber stocking of 26, 27, and 20 tons per acre, respectively, as compared to approximately 42, 41, and 39 tons per acre for our U.S. South portfolio at the beginning of each respective year.
Large Dispositions
Large dispositions are sales of large blocks of timberland properties in one or several transactions with the objective to generate proceeds to fund capital allocation priorities, including, but not limited to redeployment into more desirable timberland investments, paying down outstanding debt, or repurchasing shares of our common stock. Such large dispositions are not part of core operations, are infrequent in nature and may or may not have a higher or better use than timber production or result in a price premium above the land’s timber production value.
In November 2018, we completed the disposition of 56,100 acres of wholly-owned timberlands located in Texas and Louisiana (the "Southwest Property") for approximately $79.3 million. This large disposition represented approximately 11.9% of our average fee timberland acreage (based on average quarterly fee timberland acreage) for 2018. The disposed timberland acres had an average merchantable timber stocking of 32 tons per acre, as compared to 42 tons per acre for our U.S. South portfolio at the beginning of 2018. 
Timber Agreements
Mahrt Timber Agreements
We are party to a master stumpage agreement and a fiber supply agreement (collectively, the “Mahrt Timber Agreements”) with a wholly-owned subsidiary of WestRock. The master stumpage agreement provides that we will sell specified amounts of timber and make available certain portions of our timberlands to CatchMark TRS for harvesting. The fiber supply agreement provides that WestRock will purchase a specified tonnage of timber from CatchMark TRS at specified prices per ton, depending upon the type of timber product. The prices for the timber purchased pursuant to the fiber supply agreement are negotiated every two years but are subject to quarterly adjustments based on an index published by TimberMart-South, a quarterly trade publication that reports raw forest product prices in 11 southern states. The initial term of the Mahrt Timber Agreements is October 9, 2007 through December 31, 2032, subject to extension and early termination provisions. The Mahrt Timber Agreements ensure a long-term supply of wood fiber products for WestRock in order to meet its paperboard and lumber production requirements at specified mills and provide us with a reliable consumer for the wood products from our timberlands. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, WestRock purchased approximately 479,000 tons under the Mahrt Timber Agreements, which exceeded the minimum requirement of 408,000 tons. WestRock has historically purchased tonnage that exceeded the minimum requirement under Mahrt Timber Agreements. See Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the material terms of the Mahrt Timber Agreements. 
We derived approximately 17% of our net timber sales revenue from the Mahrt Timber Agreements in each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. For 2019, we are required to make available for purchase by WestRock,

and WestRock is required to purchase, a minimum of 374,800 tons of timber under the Mahrt Timber Agreements. The decrease in the minimum requirement from the previous year is due to lower planned harvest volumes for 2019 from the timberlands acquired in 2007, which is the basis of deriving minimum requirements under the Mahrt Timber Agreements. 
Carolinas Supply Agreement
On June 15, 2016, we assumed a pulpwood supply agreement (the "Carolinas Supply Agreement") in connection with our largest timberland acquisition since our listing in 2013 excluding our joint venture transactions (the "Carolinas Midlands III transaction"). The Carolinas Supply Agreement requires us to harvest and sell agreed-upon pulpwood volumes to IP and IP is required to purchase these volumes at defined market prices. Through its expiration on November 3, 2026, the Carolinas Supply Agreement is expected to represent between 100,000 to 150,000 tons of our annual harvest. 

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold approximately 145,000 tons of timber under the Carolinas Supply Agreement, which exceeded the required 137,000 tons. We derived approximately 5%, 6%, and 4% of our net timber sales revenue from the Carolinas Supply Agreement in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. For 2019, we are required to harvest and sell a minimum of 99,000 tons of timber under the Carolinas Supply Agreement. 
Credit Risk of Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2018, our largest customer, WestRock, represented 20% of our consolidated revenues. IP represented 12% of our consolidated revenues. No other customer represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. The loss of WestRock or IP as a customer would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We sold timber to 67 customers in 2018, compared to 64 in 2017.
We are not aware of any reason why our current customers will not be able to pay their contractual amounts as they become due in all material respects. 
Competition 
We compete with various private and industrial timberland owners as well as governmental agencies that own or manage timberlands in the U.S. South and the Pacific Northwest. Due to transportation and delivery costs, pulp, paper and wood products manufacturing facilities typically purchase wood fiber within a 100-mile radius of their location, which thereby limits, to some degree, the number of significant competitors in any specific regional market. Factors affecting the level of competition in our industry include price, species, grade, quality, proximity to the mill customer, and our reliability and consistency as a supplier. Also, as we seek to acquire timberland assets, we are in competition for targeted timberland tracts with other similar timber investment companies, as well as investors in land for purposes other than growing timber. As a result, we may have to pay more for the timberland tracts to become the owner if another suitable tract cannot be substituted. When it becomes time to dispose of timberland tracts, we will again be in competition with sellers of similar tracts to locate suitable purchasers of timberland. 
Seasonality
Our harvest operations are affected by weather conditions, where wet weather could reduce our harvest volume but boost prices due to limited supply, while dry weather could suppress prices due to increases in supply.
