Overview 
 MyoKardia, Inc., is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering a precision medicine approach to discover, develop and commercialize targeted therapies for the treatment of serious and neglected rare cardiovascular diseases. Since our inception in 2012, we have generated a robust pipeline of small molecules that target diseases driven by cardiac muscle contraction. Excessive contraction, impaired relaxation and/or insufficient contraction can all result in conditions in which the output of blood from the heart cannot meet the body’s demands. Our lead product candidate, mavacamten, is initially being developed for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM. In HCM, the walls of the heart thicken due to excessive contraction and prevent the left ventricle from expanding, resulting in a reduced pumping capacity. Mavacamten is being studied in four clinical trials in patients with HCM, including a 220-patient pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial known as EXPLORER-HCM. We are evaluating a second clinical-stage candidate, MYK-491, in patients with systolic heart failure, in which the left ventricle is too distended and weak to adequately pump blood. MYK-491 is currently in a Phase 2a clinical proof-of-concept study. 
 Our goal is to be the world’s leading precision cardiovascular medicine company. Precision medicine involves discovering and developing therapies that integrate clinical and molecular information based on the biological basis of disease. Our strategy is to identify homogenous subgroups of patients with a given cardiovascular disease, understand the causal factors underlying that subgroup’s condition, and develop targeted therapies designed to correct the common underlying defect leading to abnormal cardiac contraction or relaxation within each subgroup. We utilize the tools and technologies of precision medicine, such as genotypic or phenotypic profiling, to identify patient subgroups and biomarkers to directly measure the effects of our product candidates early in clinical development, establishing proof-of-mechanism and providing important early predictive value to inform the design of subsequent trials. 
 Our initial research has focused on genetic mutations in sarcomeric proteins of the heart muscle. These mutations directly affect the power of contraction, the rate of relaxation, or both, reducing the overall ability of the heart to pump blood at an output that matches the needs of the rest of the body. We have leveraged our knowledge of heart muscle biology to discover and optimize a portfolio of proprietary small molecule therapeutics that target the biomechanical defects that cause disruptions in heart muscle contraction. By correcting the underlying biomechanical defects, we believe our therapeutic candidates can correct or offset the downstream disruption in cardiac muscle function that drives disease progression. 
 Since our inception, we have generated multiple programs to address a variety of disruptions in heart muscle contraction. We are advancing the following research and development programs:
  
• | Mavacamten is being developed as an orally-administered small molecule designed to address the excessive contractility, left ventricular hypertrophy and reduced compliance characteristic of HCM.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MYK-491 is being developed as an orally-administered small molecule designed to increase contractility without impairing diastolic filling in patients with systolic heart failure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MYK-224 is our second small molecule program targeting hypercontractility and impaired relaxation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ACT-1 is our small molecule program directed toward increasing cardiac contractility in genetic dilated cardiomyopathy, or DCM.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | LUS-1 is our program to counteract a muscle abnormality that results in impaired relaxation of the left ventricle.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Mavacamten is initially being developed for the treatment of symptomatic obstructive HCM, or oHCM. In a Phase 2 clinical trial, known as PIONEER-HCM, mavacamten achieved statistically significant changes in the primary endpoint of post-exercise left ventricular outflow tract, or LVOT, gradient from baseline and demonstrated improvements across key secondary endpoints including New York Heart Association, or NYHA, functional classification, exercise capacity as measured by peak oxygen consumption, or peak VO2, and change in dyspnea scores.  In 2018, we initiated four additional studies of mavacamten:  a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study of oHCM patients known as EXPLORER-HCM; a Phase 2 clinical study, known as MAVERICK-HCM, in a second potential indication, symptomatic, non-obstructive, or nHCM; a long-term extension trial of oHCM patients from our Phase 2 PIONEER-HCM study; and a long-term extension study of patients completing our Phase 2 MAVERICK-HCM or Phase 3 EXPLORER-HCM trials, known as MAVA-LTE.  We anticipate reporting data from our Phase 3 EXPLORER-HCM trial in the second half of 2020.  Pending the outcome of that study, we plan to file a New Drug Application seeking regulatory approval of mavacamten for the treatment of symptomatic oHCM.  In 2016, mavacamten was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for the treatment of symptomatic oHCM.  Data from the Phase 2 MAVERICK-HCM trial in nHCM is anticipated in the second half of 2019.  We plan to report long-term safety and efficacy results from the PIONEER-OLE trial periodically.

Our second clinical-stage candidate, MYK-491, has completed two single-ascending dose Phase 1 studies, in healthy volunteers and in DCM patients with stable heart failure. MYK-491 was shown to increase cardiac contractility by 5-20 percent across multiple echocardiographic parameters at higher dose concentrations, with minimal impact on diastolic function. We are currently studying MYK-491 in a Phase 2a study looking at several echocardiographic measures of contractility and diastolic function. Data from the Phase 2a multiple-ascending dose trial are anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2019. Following achievement of proof-of-concept from the ongoing Phase 2a study, we plan to advance MYK-491 into late-stage clinical trials in a well-defined systolic heart failure patient population. Systolic heart failure is estimated to affect two to three million people in the United States.
 In addition to mavacamten and MYK-491, we are advancing several preclinical programs aimed at precision treatment of systolic and diastolic diseases. We anticipate advancing at least one new therapeutic candidate into clinical development approximately every 12-24 months.
 Our precision medicine platform incorporates disease research, drug discovery and clinical expertise in a self-reinforcing cycle of learning. For example, our data from animal models that closely mimic human disease may inform clinical development objectives, and data generated from our experience in the clinical studies may inform discovery, optimization and development choices for therapeutics in our emerging pipeline. Our integrated research and development efforts enables the iterative generation of new disease targets and clinical development candidates designed to establish early clinical proof-of-concept. We believe that the virtuous cycle that results from these strategic choices represents a durable competitive advantage that enables us to efficiently develop therapies with disease-modifying potential for heritable cardiomyopathies that could also be applied to other cardiovascular diseases. 
 Another competitive advantage is our commitment to disease area leadership.  We have formed long-standing relationships with HCM patient advocacy groups and academic and clinical researchers to create an extended community dedicated to advancing our understanding of HCM.  In 2014, we launched the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe).  SHaRe is a multi-center, international repository of clinical and laboratory data on more than 9,000 individuals and family members affected by HCM and DCM, funded by research grants from MyoKardia.  Data generated from SHaRe is a component of our precision medicine platform.  Our commitment to disease area leadership continues with numerous additional initiatives, including our support of the HCM Care App, a patient education resource developed in collaboration with Duke Clinical Research Institute, the launch in 2018 of the MyoSeeds™ Research Grant Program, and a research collaboration with 23andMe, Inc., a consumer genetics and research company.  
 We retain global development and commercialization rights to all our programs. We believe consolidated control over our entire portfolio will allow us to make strategic decisions about how we advance each of our therapeutic candidates in alignment with our precision medicine approach. 
 Persistent Obstacles to Innovative Cardiovascular Development
 Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death and disability both in the United States and globally, affecting 85.6 million Americans and accounting for one in every six healthcare dollars spent.  Although cardiovascular disease accounts for more deaths in the United States each year than all types of cancers combined, as of 2017, the number of oncology-focused therapeutics in development was nearly seven times greater than that of cardiovascular therapies.  Despite the increasing global burden of cardiovascular disease, investment in cardiovascular drug development has stagnated over the past two decades, resulting in a shortage of innovative therapies addressing the underlying causes of disease. 
 We believe that traditional approaches to cardiovascular drug development have not adequately addressed the significant patient need due to the following limitations:
 
 
• | Existing therapies are designed to treat the symptoms and not the underlying cause of the disease. Despite important advances in understanding the clinical progression of cardiovascular diseases, a specific understanding of the fundamental molecular and genetic drivers of disease has been lacking. As a result, researchers have been limited in their ability to discover or develop therapies that target causal disease mechanisms and to properly select patients. This lack of understanding limits the predictive value of early clinical results.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Large, outcome-based studies are needed to demonstrate statistical significance, requiring lengthy and expensive trials. Due to the size and heterogeneity of the cardiovascular patient population, large numbers of patients typically must be studied for extended periods to accumulate enough data regarding clinical events such as cardiovascular death, heart attack, stroke or hospitalization for heart failure. We believe the non-targeted nature of these lengthy studies has discouraged investment and innovation in novel cardiovascular drug development due to the costs and risk of late-stage failures.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | The drug development model neglects rare disease populations. Due to the high costs and risks of executing large trials in cardiovascular disease, approved therapies typically must target large patient segments, without differentiating among unique patient subgroups, in order to be commercially viable. For example, physicians have historically approached the treatment of patients with heritable cardiomyopathies in the same manner as the broader, undifferentiated heart failure population, resulting in therapies not informed by their gene mutations, and therefore not specifically designed for the pathophysiology of their heart disease.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These challenges have resulted in a relatively low number of new molecular entities approved by the FDA compared to other disease areas. As a result, there is a significant opportunity to improve clinical benefits through the use of precision medicine for the discovery and development of new treatments.
 
Our Solution: MyoKardia’s Approach to Precision Cardiovascular Therapies
 We are pioneering the application of precision medicine to cardiovascular disease with a pipeline of small molecule candidates targeting diseases of cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation being developed in well-defined patient populations. Our precision medicine platform enables the efficient discovery and development of novel precision drug candidates with disease-modifying potential. By leveraging our platform, we believe we can overcome many of the challenges associated with traditional cardiovascular drug development.
Our Precision Medicine Platform
 Our precision medicine platform incorporates disease research, drug discovery and clinical expertise in a self-reinforcing cycle that enables the iterative generation of new disease targets and clinical development candidates designed to establish early clinical proof-of-concept. By efficiently developing product candidates that target distinct biomechanical defects associated with cardiac muscle contraction, we use clinical feedback on patient genetics, response to therapy and disease presentation to refine our understanding of which patients are most likely to benefit from our product candidates. We believe this virtuous cycle is a competitive advantage that enables us to efficiently develop therapies with disease-modifying potential for heritable cardiomyopathies that could also be applied to other cardiovascular diseases.
 Our discovery process begins with a deep mechanistic understanding of how disease-causing mutations affect the biomechanical function of the heart. This starting point is then translated into screens that help us identify small molecule agents that have the potential to be optimized to correct the underlying defect. The most promising of these agents are then tested in preclinical animal models that we believe are transferable to and predictive of human systems. These models are also used to develop biomarkers of drug action and, when possible, disease modification, that integrate into our early clinical development strategies. Across this entire spectrum, we leverage novel insights generated from our position at the center of the cardiomyopathy ecosystem. By applying this cycle to multiple programs, we have generated a growing library of proprietary therapeutic molecules that target a wide range of potential cardiac disease-related mechanisms and that can be used to test new hypotheses arising from our clinical research.
 Advantages of Our Approach
 We believe that our approach can overcome many of the obstacles facing cardiovascular drug discovery and development that have resulted in a lack of cardiovascular therapeutic innovation:

• | Our precision medicine platform enables the discovery and development of therapies with disease-modifying potential. We believe our deep understanding of heart failure, including heritable cardiomyopathies, and the biomechanical defects that cause these conditions, allows us to target critical or causal disease mechanisms. We intend to develop each of our product candidates to prevent or reverse disease progression by correcting underlying biomechanical defects in the heart’s contractile machinery.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our clinical development approach is designed to investigate efficacy and safety in smaller, less time-consuming clinical trials. Our approach has the potential to significantly reduce the time and cost of drug development for cardiovascular indications. Our product candidates are designed to target the underlying cause of disease, which we believe increases the chance they will be effective and reduces the potential for unintended consequences or off-target effects. Through the use of appropriate predictive biomarkers and patient selection strategies we believe that we can reduce the risk of late-stage clinical failures. This approach is consistent with recent FDA communications and publications on how the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry can improve efficiency and the likelihood of success in cardiovascular drug development.

Targeting Cardiac Muscle Contraction 
 A sarcomere is an assembly of proteins that forms the smallest contractile unit of muscle. Each cardiac muscle cell contains many sarcomeres, and these cells are arranged in an organized manner as cardiac muscle fiber. Thousands of sarcomeres acting in concert provide the ensemble force for muscle contraction. Sarcomeres are composed of a thin filament and a thick filament, each of which contains multiple proteins braided together. To initiate contraction, myosin, the motor protein anchored to the thick filament, binds to actin, the main protein of the thin filament, forming a cross-bridge. The contraction of the sarcomere is driven by the swinging of the cross-bridge causing the thin filament to slide over the thick filament, shortening the length of a sarcomere. Myosin attaches to the thin filament, pulls it forward and detaches in a tightly-regulated cycle. In the heart, contraction corresponds to systole and relaxation corresponds to diastole.
 
In the graphic below, the dark myosin heads are engaged with the thin filament, each forming a cross-bridge between actin and myosin.


Mutations in cardiac sarcomere proteins that disrupt normal cardiac muscle contraction underpin a number of types of cardiovascular disease by affecting the power of contraction, the rate of relaxation, or both, and thereby reducing the overall ability of the heart to pump blood at an output that matches the needs of the body at rest and with exertion. The disruptions in cardiac muscle contraction result in abnormal intracardiac blood pressures and chamber volumes and thickening or thinning of the walls of the heart. These pathological changes often result in a cascade of events with devastating consequences to patients, including reduced exercise capacity limited by shortness of breath or chest pain, reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, dangerous abnormal heart rhythms, stroke, progressive heart failure and sudden cardiac death. In some patients, these events result in the need for heart transplantation.
 There are hundreds of individual mutations that have been identified in the genes encoding the proteins of the sarcomere. These many mutations give rise to a few common biomechanical defects in the sarcomere at the protein level. Through our research, we have linked these biomechanical defects to three distinct cardiac muscle disruptions that act to cause the excessive contraction, impaired relaxation and/or insufficient contraction underlying many forms of heart failure. 
 Heart Failure and Heritable Cardiomyopathies
 Heart failure describes any condition in which the heart is unable to fill or pump blood sufficient to meet the needs of the body. According to the American Heart Association, heart failure affects approximately 6.5 million people in the United States. The causes of heart failure are varied and diverse and can include damage to the heart muscle from myocardial infarctions, toxic effects of cancer chemotherapy agents and genetic mutations.  Regardless of cause, the symptoms of heart failure are often similar, including shortness of breath, edema, reduction in activities and fatigue. Heart failure is progressive; once there has been an occurrence of acute 
 7


decompensation, or a sudden worsening of symptoms, patients are at higher risk of further decompensation and hospitalizations, leading to death.  
 Systolic heart failure, or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), occurs when the left ventricle is unable to adequately contract and pump blood. The left ventricle becomes distended, and the muscle further weakens.  It is unable to contract with sufficient force to pump the amount of oxygenated and nutrient-filled blood the body needs.  The terms systolic heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy are sometimes used interchangeably to describe this condition. Systolic heart failure makes up a little less than half the overall heart failure population, or approximately 3 million people in the United States. 
 Diastolic heart failure, also called heart failure with preserved ejection, or HFpEF, occurs when the heart is unable to properly fill with blood during the period between each contraction.  The left ventricle is less distensible than normal, requiring a high pressure to fill, particularly during stress.  As in systolic heart failure, symptoms such as shortness of breath, edema, and fatigue develop related to the heart’s inability to pump an adequate amount of oxygenated blood. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is one example of a disease in which the excess contractility of the heart has resulted in hypertrophy and stiffness that prevents the normal filling and pumping of blood.  Diseases of diastolic dysfunction are estimated to affect approximately 3 million people in the United States, and there are currently no approved treatments proven to improve outcomes in patients with diastolic heart failure.
 We believe that heart failure, whether occurring due to systolic or diastolic dysfunction, is made up of a number of distinct patient segments, each of which may be driven by shared genetic or phenotypic characteristics.  Starting with heritable cardiomyopathies, such as HCM and DCM, we are discovering and developing novel targeted therapeutics tailored to address the biomechanical dysfunction in cardiac muscle contraction underlying a given condition. While some of our candidates may have broad applicability to diseases of systolic or diastolic function, our strategy is to apply a precision medicine approach to our drug development efforts. 
 Our Pipeline 
 We have generated several proprietary, orally administered small molecules to address a variety of biomechanical defects that cause disruptions in heart muscle contraction. By correcting the underlying biomechanical defects, we believe our targeted therapies can correct or offset the downstream disruption in cardiac muscle function that drives disease progression. Our lead drug candidate, mavacamten, has been shown to reduce the number of myosin-actin cross-bridges, restoring normal cardiac muscle contraction and improving left ventricular compliance. MYK-491 is intended to restore normal cardiac muscle contractility in patients with DCM caused by mutations that result in inadequate cardiac muscle contraction because of too few cross-bridges. MYK-224 is our second HCM-targeting candidate designed to reduce excess cardiac contractility and improve diastolic function. ACT-1 is intended to increase cardiac muscle contractility in patients with genetic DCM through a different mechanism than that of MYK-491. LUS-1 is intended to counteract a muscle disruption that results in impaired relaxation of the heart, a biomechanical defect thought to be a causal factor in numerous types of diastolic heart failure, as well as specific HCM patient subgroups and less common heritable cardiomyopathies.

Mavacamten for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
 Mavacamten is in clinical development as an orally administered small molecule intended to reduce left ventricular contractility to alleviate the functional consequences and symptoms of HCM and prevent or reverse HCM progression. 
 In June 2018, we initiated the pivotal Phase 3 EXPLORER-HCM clinical trial of mavacamten. EXPLORER-HCM is a multi-national randomized double-blind study that will enroll approximately 220 patients with symptomatic, obstructive HCM. We expect to report data from the EXPLORER-HCM trial in the second half of 2020. Mavacamten is also being developed for a second indication, non-obstructive HCM, or nHCM. We are currently conducting a multi-center, randomized, double-blind dose-ranging study, known as MAVERICK-HCM, in approximately 60 nHCM patients. We anticipate data from the MAVERICK-HCM clinical trial will be reported in the second half of 2019. Two additional long-term safety studies of mavacamten are ongoing. Taken together, we believe that data from the four clinical studies of mavacamten will support a planned NDA filing with FDA after results from the EXPLORER trial are available.   
 The following table summarizes our mavacamten clinical development program:

Overview of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
 HCM is defined as an otherwise unexplained thickening of the walls of the heart, known as hypertrophy. HCM is caused by mutations in the sarcomere that result in excessive cardiac muscle contraction. The consequences include reduced left ventricular blood volumes and cardiac output, reduced ability of the left ventricle to expand, and high cardiac filling pressures. These can all contribute to reduced effort tolerance and symptoms that include shortness of breath and chest pain. Additionally, other structural changes such as left atrial enlargement occur, leading to the development of arrhythmias and heart failure.




HCM is a chronic disease, and for the majority of patients the disease progresses slowly with the development of severe symptoms despite existing medical therapies. Mild physical exertion can quickly result in fatigue or shortness of breath, and a patient’s ability to participate in normal work, family or recreational activities can be substantially curtailed. According to research published in Circulation by SHaRe researchers who evaluated data from nearly 4,600 patients, people with HCM have significantly higher mortality compared to that of the general U.S. population. Further, patients with genetic HCM exhibited disease at younger ages and were more likely to experience HCM-related complications and early death. In approximately 15% to 20% of patients, disease progression results in disabling heart failure that can prevent the patients from holding a job or performing everyday activities of daily living. HCM can also cause stroke or sudden cardiac death. HCM is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young people, with a five-year incidence among children of 3%. 
 HCM affects approximately one in every 500 people worldwide and is the most frequent form of heritable cardiomyopathy. It is estimated that as many as 630,000 people in the United States have a form of HCM, and based on insurance claims data, an estimated 100,000 of these individuals have been diagnosed with the disease. 
 Obstructive HCM Patients. In approximately two-thirds of HCM patients, the path followed by blood exiting the heart, known as the left ventricular outflow tract, or LVOT, becomes obstructed by the enlarged and diseased muscle, restricting the flow of blood from the heart to the rest of the body. These patients, referred to as oHCM patients, are at an increased risk of severe heart failure and death. Our current clinical development plan, including EXPLORER-HCM, is intended to target this group of symptomatic oHCM patients or subgroups thereof as our initial patient population for mavacamten. In 2016, the FDA granted mavacamten Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of patients with symptomatic oHCM.
 Non-Obstructive HCM Patients. Symptomatic, non-obstructive, HCM patients represent a distinct subgroup that is difficult to manage medically. This segment may contain a more severely affected population because nHCM patients are typically diagnosed when their disease is more advanced than obstructive HCM patients. Furthermore, for oHCM patients, relief of the obstruction is often associated with an improvement in symptoms, while no such treatment option is available to nHCM patients. We are conducting the Phase 2 MAVERICK-HCM clinical trials to assess mavacamten’s ability to target symptomatic nHCM.
 Current Standard of Care for Patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
 The current standard of care for HCM is limited, and many patients remain symptomatic. The beta-blocker propranolol is recommended for the treatment of symptomatic HCM. However, beta blockers are frequently ineffective and have off-target adverse effects that limit their use. Patients are therefore prescribed additional drugs indicated for the treatment of hypertension, heart failure or other cardiovascular disorders more generally. These drugs, including non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (such as verapamil and diltiazem) and the antiarrhythmic disopyramide, do not address the underlying cause of HCM, do not appear to affect 
 10


disease progression, and have limited tolerability. While clinical experience and expert opinion suggest that these drugs may provide symptom relief in some patients, no controlled clinical research evidence exists to directly support their efficacy. For a subset of HCM patients with more advanced disease progression or more pronounced symptoms, surgical or other invasive interventions may be appropriate, including heart transplantation, use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, open surgical myectomy or percutaneous alcohol septal ablation.
 Mavacamten’s Clinical Development
 In 2018, we initiated four clinical trials of mavacamten for the treatment of HCM, including the Phase 3 pivotal EXPLORER-HCM clinical trial and a long-term extension study, which we believe will form the backbone of our planned registration filing with the FDA for the potential regulatory approval of mavacamten. 
 Our Phase 1 program for mavacamten consisted of three clinical trials, including two single-ascending dose (SAD) trials and one multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial. Across these three trials, we dosed 86 healthy volunteers and 15 HCM patients with mavacamten, in addition to 22 subjects that received placebo. We observed favorable tolerability of single and multiple doses of mavacamten in both healthy volunteers and HCM patients and demonstrated the ability of mavacamten to reduce cardiac muscle contractility, an important biomarker of disease. Additionally, we generated preliminary evidence in two patients with obstructive HCM that led us to believe that mavacamten could reduce LVOT obstruction.
 Our Phase 2 clinical trial of mavacamten, known as PIONEER-HCM, was a twelve-week open-label study to assess the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of mavacamten in patients with symptomatic oHCM. PIONEER-HCM consisted of two dosing cohorts: in Cohort A, patients received a once-daily 10mg, 15mg or 20mg dose of mavacamten and were required to discontinue background therapy, including beta blockers, prior to study entry; and Cohort B, in which subjects received a once-daily 2mg or 5mg oral dose of mavacamten and nine out ten patients remained on beta blocker therapy. Baseline patient characteristics were similar across both patient cohorts.
 In the third quarter of 2017, we reported positive results from ten patients in Cohort A of PIONEER-HCM. A statistically significant improvement was observed in the primary endpoint, change in post-exercise peak LVOT gradient from baseline to Week 12 (p=0.002). After 12 weeks of treatment, all 10 patients (100%) in Cohort A achieved a reduction in post-exercise peak LVOT gradient from a baseline mean of 125 mmHg. Additionally, this cohort met key secondary endpoints with statistical significance, including change in peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2) and New York Heart Association, or NYHA, functional classification of symptoms.
 In the first quarter of 2018, we reported results for the second cohort, Cohort B, of the PIONEER-HCM trial in which all ten patients enrolled achieved statistically significant reductions in post-exercise and resting LVOT gradient (p=0.020). Mavacamten also demonstrated improvements in secondary endpoints intended to measure symptoms and functional capacity. The use of background beta blockers, permitted only in Cohort B, did not appear to impact mavacamten’s safety or pharmacodynamic profile. 
 In both cohorts, mavacamten was generally well-tolerated. One patient in the Cohort A elected to stop the study drug at Week 4 after experiencing a serious adverse event. All other adverse events, or AEs, were mild to moderate, and a majority of the AEs were deemed to be unrelated to the study drug. 
 The PIONEER-HCM study has informed a target concentration range at which mavacamten is expected to achieve clinically meaningful improvements in oHCM symptoms, functional classification (e.g., NYHA), and exercise capacity (e.g., peak VO2) while maintaining LVEF in a normal range of greater than or equal to 50 percent. Data from the Phase 2 PIONEER-HCM study helped inform the starting dose, guide dose adjustment and define endpoints for our Phase 3 clinical trial of mavacamten in symptomatic oHCM, known as EXPLORER-HCM. We reviewed PIONEER-HCM data and the EXPLORER-HCM study design with the Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products of the FDA, incorporating their input. We plan to conduct a single pivotal study along with a long-term extension study to support registration.
 EXPLORER-HCM is a multi-national randomized double-blind study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 30 weeks of once-daily treatment with mavacamten in patients with oHCM. Patients are randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either mavacamten or placebo for a 30-week treatment period. The primary endpoint is clinical response, defined as either 1) an improvement of at least 1.5 mL/kg/min in peak oxygen consumption accompanied by an improvement from baseline of at least one NYHA functional class or 2) an improvement from baseline of 3.0 mL/kg/min or greater in peak VO2 without worsening in NYHA functional class. Secondary endpoints in the Phase 3 EXPLORER-HCM trial will include the average changes from baseline in post-exercise peak LVOT gradient, NYHA functional class, and peak VO2. Exploratory endpoints include changes in echocardiographic indices of cardiac structure and function, N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide or NT-proBNP, concentrations, quality of life questionnaire scores 
 11


and daily physical activity assessed using a wearable accelerometer. Following the 30-week treatment period and eight-week post-treatment wash-out period, patients will be encouraged to participate in a long-term extension study of mavacamten.
 The EXPLORER-HCM trial design incorporates individualized dosing, including two dose adjustments during the 30-week treatment period based on measurements of LVOT gradient. All assessments and dose adjustments are conducted in a blinded fashion. Patients are allowed to maintain their HCM-related background medications for the duration of the EXPLORER-HCM Phase 3 trial, including beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. An independent data monitoring committee has been established to monitor safety throughout the study.
 We are also conducting an open-label extension study of mavacamten among patients who previously completed the Phase 2 PIONEER-HCM trial. This study, known as PIONEER-OLE, has enrolled thirteen of the twenty eligible patients. Patients receive an individualized daily dose of 5mg, 10mg, or 15 mg of mavacamten, with a dose adjustment at Week 6 based on pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic criteria, as well as the patient’s past experience with mavacamten. We plan to periodically report data from the PIONEER-OLE study, sharing observations on safety, echocardiographic measures of drug activity, including LVOT gradient, and patient symptoms and function. 
 In April 2018, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of mavacamten in non-obstructive HCM patients, which we refer to as MAVERICK-HCM. The purpose of this Phase 2 clinical trial is to determine optimal dosing of mavacamten in patients without LVOT obstruction. We intend to enroll approximately 60 subjects in this trial, and data from MAVERICK-HCM is anticipated in the second half of 2019. Patients with nHCM share the same genetic mutations as their oHCM counterpart and left ventricular hypertrophy is a central characteristic of their disease. As nHCM patients do not have outflow obstruction, a lack of left ventricular compliance, or inability of the heart to fill optimally with blood, is thought to be a greater driver of their condition. Based on evidence from preclinical studies and our PIONEER-HCM clinical trial, mavacamten appears to have a positive impact on diastolic relaxation. The MAVERICK-HCM trial will provide additional evidence of this potential effect for mavacamten, ultimately informing the late-stage development of mavacamten in the nHCM indication, and/or informing our development plans for our MYK-224 or LUS-1 program candidates. 
 Patients from the EXPLORER-HCM and MAVERICK-HCM clinical trials are encouraged to participate in our long-term extension study of mavacamten, known as MAVA-LTE. The MAVA-LTE study will assess long-term safety of mavacamten, as well as its effects on symptoms and echocardiographic measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function. We expect to enroll up to 280 patients in the MAVA-LTE study, and approximately 100 patients will be randomized to participate in a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging sub study to assess the potential effects of mavacamten treatment on cardiac remodeling. 
 MYK-224 for HCM
 We are advancing a second candidate targeting HCM, known as MYK-224, into the clinic. MYK-224 is designed to preserve the unique advantages of mavacamten’s mechanism, including the ability to reduce excess contractility and potentially address impaired relaxation by reducing the number of engaged myosin-actin cross-bridges, while reducing pharmacokinetic variability. We believe MYK-224 may reduce the time required to achieve steady state and thereby provide enhanced dosing flexibility. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical study of MYK-224 in healthy volunteers in the first half of 2019.
 MyoKardia’s Activator Portfolio for Systolic Heart Failure
 Our portfolio of precision cardiovascular therapeutics includes multiple cardiac muscle activator programs aimed at increasing contraction of the heart muscle and thereby improving blood flow from the heart.  We are initially targeting precision indications in systolic heart failure and specifically, dilated cardiomyopathies.  Our clinical-stage therapeutic candidate, MYK-491, is an orally-administered small molecule designed to increase the number of myosin-actin cross-bridges formed during cardiac muscle contraction, thereby increasing the ensemble force of contraction and improving cardiac output.  One goal of MYK-491 is to increase cardiac contractility, thereby improving systolic function, while having minimal impact on diastolic function, or the ability of the heart to relax and fill with blood.  Based on preclinical research across multiple animal models, as well as our Phase 1 clinical studies, MYK-491 may hold potential for controlled increases in the heart’s contractility with limited impact on relaxation.
Overview of Dilated Cardiomyopathy
 The fundamental cause of all systolic heart failure is that the heart muscles are not able to contract with sufficient force. In DCM, the loss of contractility leads the walls of the left ventricle to become thin and over-expanded, functioning under increased stress. This leads to even further progression of cardiac dysfunction. In contrast to HCM, some forms of DCM are characterized by decreased power output of the sarcomeres. In some patients with genetic DCM, this lack of power is caused by genetic mutations that disrupt the ability of individual myosin motors to form cross-bridges with actin and contribute to overall contraction.
 12


DCM is a life-threatening progressive disease. Once symptoms appear, a patient’s condition typically declines steadily over the next few years. Typical symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the extremities or an irregular heartbeat. As the disease progresses, patients become increasingly debilitated and experience persistent shortness of breath, even at rest. Diastolic function, or the heart’s ability to relax and fill with blood, is also impaired because the heart is expanded. The dilated left ventricle is itself deprived of an adequate supply of oxygen that may contribute to fibrosis and the risk of dangerous heart rhythm disturbances. In addition, whether or not symptoms have appeared, patients with dilated cardiomyopathy are at risk of sudden cardiac death.
 Current Standard of Care for Patients with Dilated Cardiomyopathy
 DCM patients are typically prescribed one or more drugs indicated for the treatment of systolic heart failure generally, such as diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists. By treating various signs and symptoms of heart disease and addressing some of the compensatory mechanisms described above, these drugs may reduce overall morbidity and mortality; however, none of the treatments address the underlying cause of disease or eliminate disease progression. Surgical or interventional options available to DCM patients include use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, a biventricular pacemaker, and in refractory patients, a left ventricular assist device and cardiac transplant.
MYK-491 Clinical Development
 We are currently enrolling a Phase 2a multiple-ascending dose study to assess the safety of MYK-491 when dosed chronically to steady state and establish proof-of-concept. Up to 40 DCM patients with stable heart failure will be randomized to receive either MYK-491 or placebo for one week, during which time patients will be monitored to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of MYK-491. We anticipate reporting data from the Phase 2a study in the fourth quarter of 2019. All of our clinical studies of MYK-491 rely on the use of non-invasive biomarkers to evaluate left ventricular contractility to establish early proof of mechanism.
 Our Phase 1 clinical development program for MYK-491 principally evaluated the safety and tolerability of MYK-491 in healthy human subjects and DCM patients. In DCM patients with stable heart failure, administration of MYK-491 resulted in approximately 10 percent relative increases from baseline in cardiac contractility across multiple echocardiographic measures, including stroke volume, left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening. In increasing the heart’s contractility, MYK-491 did not appear to meaningfully change duration of the contraction or the heart’s ability to relax and fill with oxygenated blood. Systolic ejection time (SET), a measure of the time it takes to eject blood from the left ventricle, showed a modest increase and the impact of MYK-491 on left ventricular filling was minor across multiple measures of diastolic function. Overall, these data were consistent with results previously reported from the single-ascending dose trial of MYK-491 in healthy volunteers.
 MYK-491 was generally well tolerated across the range of oral doses tested in our first-in-human, Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers. Adverse events observed were benign and transient. Results from our Phase 1a and Phase 1b studies served to inform the starting dose for the Phase 2a study.
 ACT-1 for Genetic DCM
 ACT-1 is our preclinical activator program targeting genetic DCM due to sarcomeric mutations and impaired calcium regulation. In preclinical models, our ACT-1 prototype molecules successfully increase contractility without prolonging SET and with minimal impact on relaxation. We are able to test ACT-1 in genetic animal models, which we believe will provide us with an opportunity to establish evidence of disease modification in longitudinal studies. We currently anticipate advancing our first ACT-1 program compound into clinical development in late 2020 or early 2021.
 Emerging Research in Diseases of Diastolic Dysfunction
 Diseases of diastolic dysfunction account for approximately half of all heart failure, affecting an estimated two million to three million people in the United States alone. There are currently no treatments available that have shown benefit to HFpEF patient outcomes. We believe that a therapy capable of improving left ventricular relaxation and increasing the ability for the heart to fill with blood between beats would have profound impact on patients’ lives. 
 We have generated a growing body of preclinical and clinical data indicating that mavacamten positively impacts diastolic relaxation. We initially observed that mavacamten increased left ventricular compliance, or the ability of the left ventricle to relax and fill with blood, in a preclinical comparison of mavacamten and the beta blocker metoprolol in healthy canines and again in a genetic mini-pig model of nHCM. In both animal models, end-diastolic pressure was reduced and the ability of the left ventricle to fill improved. Data from the PIONEER-HCM Phase 2 clinical trial looking at echocardiographic measures of diastolic function also demonstrated reductions in left ventricular filling pressure and increases in filling volume.
 13


As we have learned more about mavacamten’s effects on diastolic relaxation, we have been able to apply that knowledge to our clinical and discovery research efforts. The initial observations of mavacamten’s potential diastolic effects informed the MAVERICK-HCM clinical trial, as impaired relaxation is thought to be the driving factor in nHCM symptoms. We anticipate that data from this study will provide us with valuable information on the future development of mavacamten, MYK-224 and the LUS-1 program in diseases of diastolic dysfunction.
 Our LUS-1 discovery-stage program is identifying novel therapeutics that target diastolic relaxation without reducing the force of contraction. In preclinical studies of LUS-1 molecules, we have observed improved compliance without a loss of stroke volume. We currently anticipate advancing our first LUS-1 program compound into clinical development in 2021 or 2022.
 Additional Potential Extensions of our Platform
 Beyond HCM and genetic DCM, we are researching defects caused by mutations in proteins that result in other heritable cardiomyopathies and conditions caused by abnormalities in cardiac muscle contraction, such as restrictive cardiomyopathy and left ventricular non-compaction in order to generate precision therapies for those diseases. We believe that the fundamental mechanisms we are targeting in the heart may have applicability in the broader heart failure population. The chemistries we develop to target various components of the sarcomere may also be applicable to skeletal disorders where we can define a parallel linkage between disease-causing mutations in non-cardiac muscle proteins and their resulting biomechanical defects.
Commercial Rights to Our Portfolio
 We have discovered all of the compounds in our pipeline internally and retain global development and commercialization rights to all of our programs. We believe consolidated control over our entire portfolio will allow us to make strategic decisions about how we advance each of our therapeutic candidates in alignment with our precision medicine approach. We may enter into strategic alliances in the future for certain programs where the potential therapeutic indications do not align with our precision medicines strategy or for specific therapeutic indications or geographic territories.
 In August 2014, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Aventis Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanofi S.A., for the research, development and potential commercialization of pharmaceutical products for the treatment, prevention and diagnosis of HCM and DCM, as well as potential additional indications. On December 31, 2018, Sanofi notified us that they intend to terminate the agreement with respect to the HCM-1 program and acknowledged that the agreement was deemed to be terminated as of that date with respect to all other programs.  As a result of the notification, Sanofi’s reimbursement of certain of our research and development costs will terminate effective March 31, 2019 for MYK-224 and June 30, 2019 for mavacamten. The agreement covered three main research programs: HCM-1 (mavacamten and MYK-224), HCM-2, and DCM-1 (MYK-491). Under the agreement, we retained rights to develop and commercialize mavacamten, MYK-224 and HCM-2 in the United States, as well as the option to co-commercialize MYK-491 in the United States. Sanofi was granted worldwide rights to commercialize MYK-491 and regulatory and commercialization rights outside the United States for the two HCM programs. Over the course of the collaboration, we have received the following from Sanofi:
  
(i) | $105.0 million in cash as upfront, milestone and continuation payments, in exchange for royalty-based license fees in the event of commercialization of these programs, which rights continue post-termination;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | $48.3 million in cash, in exchange for issuances of our common stock, net of offering costs and underwriting fees;
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | $43.4 million in cash, as reimbursement for certain research and development costs under the Registration Program Plan and pre-Proof of Concept terms of the agreement; and
------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 (iv)    $45.0 million of in-kind research and development support.
 Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, the Collaboration Agreement was deemed terminated with respect to programs other than the HCM-1 Program on December 31, 2018, and on that date Sanofi also notified us that they did not intend to continue the collaboration with respect to the HCM-1 Program. As a result, the agreement has been terminated in its entirety except for Sanofi’s continuing rights to receive royalties in the event of commercialization of the HCM-1 Program in the United States. The events leading up to the termination included our belief and discussion with Sanofi that it is critical to our strategy to maintain control of the U.S. commercial rights for mavacamten, as well our desire not to grant additional rights in expanded indications. We believe the termination of our collaboration agreement with Sanofi does not impact our program development timelines. Sanofi will remain eligible to receive royalties associated with any potential HCM-1 products that will range from mid-single to low-double digits in the United States. We have no royalty obligations to Sanofi for sales outside the United States.

Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates, novel biological discoveries, screening and drug development technology and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing of intellectual property to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 As for the pharmaceutical products we develop and commercialize, as a normal course of business, we intend to pursue composition-of-matter patents, where possible, and dosage and formulation patents, as well as manufacturing patents and method-of-use patents on novel indications for known compounds. We also seek patent protection with respect to novel biological discoveries, including new diagnostic methods and targets. We may also pursue patents with respect to our proprietary screening and drug development processes and technology. We may also seek patent protection, either alone or jointly with our collaborators, as our collaboration agreements may dictate. 
 Our patent estate includes five issued U.S. patents, three U.S. pending patent applications, one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, application, over 65 foreign patent applications and patents, all of which are exclusively owned by us, and some of which have claims relating to all of our current clinical-stage drug candidates. With respect to our lead drug candidates in the HCM program, we exclusively own two issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, and over 35 foreign patent applications and patents relating to the chemical composition of mavacamten and use thereof. 
 Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for twenty years from the earliest effective filing date of the utility patent application. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also twenty years from the earliest effective filing date of the utility patent application. Our currently issued U.S. patents with respect to mavacamten are expected to expire in 2034, not including any extensions due to patent restoration or regulatory exclusivities. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including, but not limited to, the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 Furthermore, the patent positions of biotechnology and some pharmaceutical products and processes like those we may develop and commercialize are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date in the United States. The patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights and more generally could affect the value of intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be granted or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our drugs and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents or due to compulsory licensing regulations. 
 Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we 
 15


may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require in order to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us. 
 In addition, substantial scientific and commercial research has been conducted for many years in the areas in which we have focused our development efforts, which has resulted in third parties having a number of issued patents and pending patent applications. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are published only after eighteen months from the priority date. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made. Additionally, failure to uncover third party rights of interest may inadvertently occur due to many factors, which include but are not limited to, the scope of the diligence conducted, human error or third-party omission.  Therefore, patent applications relating to drugs similar to mavacamten, MYK-491 and any future drugs, discoveries or technologies and their uses thereof may exist without our knowledge. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We use third-party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) for all of our requirements of raw materials, drug substance and drug product for our preclinical research and our ongoing clinical trials of mavacamten and MYK-491, and in 2019 will depend solely upon our CMOs due to the termination of our collaboration agreement with Sanofi. We have not entered into long-term agreements with our current CMOs. We intend to continue to rely on CMOs and may seek to enter into arrangements with strategic partners for later-stage development and commercialization of mavacamten and MYK-491, as well as the development and commercialization of any other product candidates that we may identify. Although we currently rely on CMOs, we have personnel and third-party consultants with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the manufacturing relationships and activities. 
 We believe the synthesis of the drug substance for mavacamten is reliable and reproducible from readily available starting materials, and the synthetic routes are amenable to large-scale production and do not require unusual equipment or handling in the manufacturing process. We have obtained an adequate supply of the drug substance for mavacamten from our first CMO to satisfy our immediate clinical and preclinical demands. We have implemented improvements to our drug substance manufacturing process to further facilitate production capacity adequate to meet future development and commercial demands. In addition, we believe the synthesis of the drug substance for MYK-491 is reliable and reproducible. We have obtained an adequate supply of the drug substance for MYK-491 from Sanofi to satisfy our immediate clinical and preclinical demands. We are developing improvements to our MYK-491 drug substance manufacturing process to further facilitate production capacity adequate to meet future development and commercial demands. 
 Drug product formulation development for mavacamten and MYK-491 is in progress. We have contracted with a third-party manufacturer capable of both formulation development and drug product manufacturing through early commercialization for mavacamten. We may identify other drug product manufacturers in the future to add additional capacity and redundancy to our supply chain. In our SAD clinical trials of mavacamten, we utilized a suspension formulation. We have developed and manufactured multiple strengths of an immediate release tablet for use in the MAD and other early stage trials (including PIONEER-HCM) trial. For future development and commercialization, we have developed a refined capsule formulation and may develop alternate formulations for the adolescent and children/infant populations. We also employed a suspension formulation for the healthy volunteers SAD study of MYK-491, which we are utilizing in the MAD study as well. We have also developed an immediate release tablet formulation for the proof-of-concept studies in patients. For future MYK-491 development and commercialization, we intend to develop a refined tablet formulation and may develop alternate formulations for the adolescent and children and infant populations.
 Sales and Marketing 
 We believe that we can maximize the value of our products by retaining substantial commercialization rights to our product candidates and, where appropriate, entering into collaborations for specific therapeutic indications or geographic territories. 
 Our current strategy is to market our initial HCM and DCM products using a dedicated, direct sales force focused on cardiomyopathy specialists and targeted cardiologists in the United States. These physicians are typically affiliated with academic institutions, leading hospitals and medical centers. We believe they represent a concentrated prescriber base that can be appropriately managed with a specialty care sales model. 
 16


Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, technology and development experience, our precision medicine platform and our pioneering culture provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any therapeutic candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products and new products that may become available in the future. 
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. 
 In the field of heart failure drug development, our principal competitors include Amgen Inc., Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, C.H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Co. KG, Novartis AG and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. Specific to our initial drug discovery and development focus areas, it is believed that Cytokinetics, Inc. has ongoing programs in HCM and that Array BioPharma Inc., Novartis AG, and Zensun (Shanghai) Sci. & Tech. Co., Ltd. have ongoing programs in DCM. Additionally, there may be other companies pursuing therapeutic candidates from which we face current or future competition. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of drug products such as those we are developing. 
 A number of different regulatory agencies may have regulatory oversight, depending on the product at issue, and the type and stage of activity. In the United States, these include the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other federal agencies, state boards of pharmacy, state-controlled substance agencies and more. 
 Government Regulation 
 Drug Development Process 
 The pharmaceutical industry is subject to extensive global regulation by regional, country, state and local agencies. In the United States, the FDA is the primary regulator of drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with applicable requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process, or after approval may subject us to adverse consequences and administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications; withdrawal of or restrictions on an approval; imposition of a clinical hold or other limitation on research; warning letters; product seizures; total or partial suspension of development, production, or distribution; or injunctions, fines, disgorgement, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 
 The process required before a drug may be marketed in the United States, the EU and most foreign countries generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical, also known as nonclinical, laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements, animal welfare laws and other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical trials, meaning trials in human subjects, may begin in the United States, obtaining similar authorizations in other jurisdictions where clinical research will be conducted and maintaining these authorizations on a continuing basis throughout the time that trials are performed and new data are collected;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements to demonstrate whether a proposed drug is safe and effective for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a marketing authorization application, such as an NDA, and submitting similar marketing authorization applications in other jurisdictions where commercialization will be pursued;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17


 
• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, and/or similar requirements in other jurisdictions where commercialization will be pursued, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA or other regulatory authority inspection of clinical trial sites to assess compliance with GCP requirements; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or other regulatory authority review and approval of a marketing authorization application.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The development, testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and bears significant, inherent risk that the individual products will not exhibit the relevant safety, effectiveness, or quality characteristics. The approval process may be more or less rigorous from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required in the United States. Approval in one country does not assure that a product will be approved in another country. We cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or with the specific terms that we desire, if at all. 
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. FDA's primary objectives in reviewing an IND are, in all phases of the investigation, to assure the safety and rights of subjects, and, in Phase 2 and 3, to help assure that the quality of the scientific evaluation of drugs is adequate to permit an evaluation of the drug's effectiveness and safety. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal studies or other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. The FDA also may impose a clinical hold after a trial has started. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, or to the governing authorities on a country by country basis. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB or ethics committee must monitor the study until completed. 
 Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The drug initially is introduced into a small number of patients or healthy human volunteers and information is collected pertaining to the drug’s safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. These trials are designed to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions, side effects with increasing doses and if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. If favorable, additional, larger Phase 2 studies may be initiated.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. These trials include controlled clinical trials initiated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of the drug candidate for a particular indication in patients with the disease or condition under study, and to determine common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. If data are satisfactory, the sponsor may commence large-scale trials to confirm the compound’s efficacy and safety.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are expanded and controlled trials undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to gather additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk profile of the drug candidate and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling and regulatory approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regulatory agencies may also require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Progress reports related to clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and participating IRBs, and other governing authorities. More frequent IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and other governing health authorities and to investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from animal or in 
 18


vitro testing or other studies that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Clinical trials may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all. The FDA or other governing authorities or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that human subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the investigational product apparently lacks efficacy. Similarly, an IRB or EC can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements or if the drug candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to healthy volunteers or patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data monitoring committee, or DMC. The DMC reviews safety information and provides recommendations to the sponsor for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. As the sponsor, we may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 At times during the development of a new drug product, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA. This commonly occurs prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 trials, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may also be requested. These meetings provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate, and the manufacturer must develop methods for confirming the identity, quality, purity and potency of the final products. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability trials must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life and distribution pathway. 
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 
 Sponsors of clinical drug trials (other than Phase 1 trials) are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, comparator, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of certain trials may be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. However, there are evolving rules and increasing requirements for publication of trial-related information, and it is possible that data and other information from trials involving drugs that never garner approval could in the future be required to be disclosed. In addition, publication policies of major medical journals mandate certain registration and disclosures as a pre-condition for potential publication, even when this is not presently mandated as a matter of law. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
New Drug Application Review and Approval Processes 
 The results of drug candidate development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug candidate, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, requesting approval to market the drug candidate for one or more proposed indications. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. 
 The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, NDAs are subject to substantial application user fees and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual prescription drug product program fees. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, the user fee for each NDA application requiring clinical data is $2,588,478. For fiscal year 2018, PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee of $309,915. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 19


The FDA reviews each NDA to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before it may be filed. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA’s goal is to review applications within ten months of the filing date or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from the filing date. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug candidate is safe and effective for its intended use and indication for use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee consisting of a panel of external experts for review and recommendation as to whether the NDA should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its active pharmaceutical ingredient will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter identifies deficiencies that may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases, dosages, or indications for use, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation, that are intended to increase agency interactions, expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing drug candidates, and/or provide for initial approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification. 
 The Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or the inability to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing trials, may allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. In addition, the FDA presently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 20


A drug can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A sponsor may request that a drug be designated as a breakthrough therapy at any time during the clinical development of the product. If so designated, FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product’s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product’s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather preclinical and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor, and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products for which we may receive future FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting and analysis of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety, efficacy and quality information, product sampling and distribution requirements, maintaining up-to-date labels, warnings, and contraindications, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the approved label; products cannot be promoted for unapproved, or off-label, uses, although physicians may prescribe drugs for off-label uses in accordance with the practice of medicine. Manufacturers must continue to comply with GMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to manufacturing processes often require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic inspections for compliance with cGMP and other laws. FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at manufacturing that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market, such as adverse events, the existence or severity of which was unknown when the product was approved. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or complete withdrawal from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, voluntary product recalls, product seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal payments or penalties. 
 From time to time, new legislation is enacted that changes the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing, and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance may be revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory or policy changes will occur or be implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term to be extended up to five years as compensation for patent term effectively lost due to the FDA’s pre-market approval requirements. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension. Extensions are not granted as a matter of right and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent and within a 60-day period from the date the product is first approved for commercial marketing. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. Where a product contains multiple active ingredients, if any one active ingredient has not been previously approved, it can form the basis of an extension of patent term provided the patent claims that ingredient or the combination. 
 21


In the future, we may apply for patent term restoration for some of our presently owned patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The specific scope varies, but fundamentally the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity never previously approved by the FDA either alone or in combination. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the compound responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability trials, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Pediatric Information and Exclusivity 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial. The FDA issues a written request for pediatric clinical trials prior to approval of a NDA only where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may produce health benefits in that population.
 Under the FDCA, NDAs and certain supplements to NDAs must contain data adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDCA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, unless the drug has been granted orphan designation for the proposed indication at the time the initial PSP is required, within 60 days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drug candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the drug for the indication can be recovered by sales of the drug in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in very limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product or the manufacturer of the product with exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of our drug candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. 
 22


As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a drug candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. In the EU, the European Commission, after reviewing the opinion of the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU Community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Orphan drug designation in the EU entitles the manufacturer to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 The FDA and foreign regulators expect holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the orphan drug. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement 
 United States 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. 
 Even if the FDA approves NDAs for our drug candidates, sales of our products will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial or private insurance, and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for new products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process. 
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drugs, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 23


European Union 
 In Europe and many other foreign countries, the success of our drug candidates we may develop depends largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement, because in many foreign countries patients are unlikely to use prescription pharmaceutical products that are not reimbursed by their governments. Negotiating reimbursement rates in foreign countries can delay the commercialization of a pharmaceutical product and generally results in a reimbursement rate that is lower than the net price that companies can obtain for the same product in the United States. 
 In some countries, such as Germany, commercial sales of a product can begin while the reimbursement rate that a company will receive in future periods is under discussion. In other countries, a company must complete the reimbursement discussions prior to the commencement of commercial sales of the pharmaceutical product. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of drugs for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the drug or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug on the market. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the number of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, pharmaceutical companies also are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, and the reporting of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, ACA, was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following: 
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic products from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. In addition, ACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales. 
  
• | In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. Effective in 2010, ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the present state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.

• | Effective in 2011, ACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic products to provide a discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Effective in 2011, ACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As part of efforts to further transparency of payments made by pharmaceutical companies to physicians, ACA required manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers were required to begin reporting this information to CMS beginning in 2014. Annual reporting is required, and records of payments are publicly available for review on the CMS website.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As of 2010, a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to ACA to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ACA created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. ACA provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.

 Anti-Kickback Laws 
 U.S. federal laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, and the Office of Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and various state agencies. These anti-kickback laws prohibit, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program. Remuneration is broadly defined to include anything of value, such as cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies, or equipment. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. The anti-kickback laws are broad and prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The penalties for violating the anti-kickback laws can be severe. The sanctions include criminal and civil penalties, and possible exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal anti-kickback laws, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payor, including third-party payors. 
 Federal and State Prohibitions on False Claims 
 The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information. Although we would not submit claims directly to government payors, manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. 
 25


Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual on behalf of the federal government who shares in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action. The number of filings under these provisions has increased significantly in recent years. Conduct that violates the False Claims Act may also lead to exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. Further, violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state healthcare programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to all payors. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 
 Federal Prohibitions on Healthcare Fraud and False Statements Related to Healthcare Matters 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, ACA broadened the reach of certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes created under HIPAA by amending the intent requirement such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 26, 2013, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Furthermore, international laws, such as the EU Data Privacy Directive (95/46/EC) and Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, regulate the processing of personal data within Europe and between European countries and the United States. Failure to provide adequate privacy protections and maintain compliance with safe harbor mechanisms could jeopardize business transactions across borders and result in significant penalties.
 Physician Payments Sunshine Act 
 There has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires most pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to the Secretary of HHS payments or “transfers of value” made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Over the next several years, we will need to dedicate significant resources to establish and maintain systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for “knowing failures.” Covered manufacturers must submit reports concerning payments and ownership and investment interests for a calendar year by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. In addition, certain states require implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities. Similar laws have been enacted or are under consideration in foreign jurisdictions, including France which has adopted the Loi Bertrand, or French Sunshine Act, which became effective in 2013, and Belgium which enacted their Sunshine Act in 2016.

Non-U.S. Healthcare Laws 
 
To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals. In addition to U.S. regulations, we are subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and distribution of our products outside of the United States. Regardless of FDA status for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Healthcare Reform 
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. By way of example, in the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient drug purchases by those covered by Medicare under a new Part D and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for Medicare Part B physician-administered drugs. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, there is additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of the MMA could decrease the coverage and reimbursement that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business. 
 In addition, in March 2010, ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. 
 On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Tax Payer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals. 
 In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, that while not a law, is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the ACA. The 2017 Tax Reform Act includes a provision repealing the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. Further, on January 20, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse the insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. Further, on June 14, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known. 
 In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. In addition, CMS has recently published a final rule that would give states greater flexibility, starting in 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well.  The

Trump Administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the Texas District Court Judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal.
 Thus, there may be further action to repeal, replace, or modify the ACA. While any further legislative and regulatory changes will likely take time to develop and may or may not have an impact on the regulatory regime to which we are subject, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.
