In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “should”, “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the section entitled “Risk Factors” that may cause our or our industry’s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.

 
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.

General Overview
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 20, 2014. We intend to offer management and consulting services to healthcare organizations. We intend to focus on ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) that currently have an incentive to be acquired by hospitals in order to increase compensation levels. We believe the short term strategy of converting to hospital based compensation is not sustainable because fundamental changes in the way healthcare is being provided are being undertaken by both government and private insurance carriers. The demographics of an aging population also mandate such changes to avoid economic disruption, healthcare rationing or unsustainable taxation.
Our Current Business
 
We are an early stage company devoted to helping clients navigate the complexities of a healthcare system in transition.

Our Services
 
We intend to offer our clients in the healthcare industry a wide array of services including but not limited to:

 

· | new practice start-up services and group practice reorganizations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | physician group advisory services, performance improvement, compensation, electronic medical records and clinical practice integration; 
· | hospital and surgical center interim management, turnaround strategies, workforce management, regulatory compliance and accreditation preparation, and start-up, transition, and closure support;
· | strategic and business planning as organizations cope with a transition to accountable care; 
· | feasibility studies, fairness opinions, and valuations; 
· | ICD-10 implementation, training, and analysis of key performance indicators. 
· | transition to value-based care, value-based payment modeling, and measurable outcomes; 

 
Our prospective clients are organizations or individual healthcare practitioners who need to accelerate their knowledge and acquisition of the systems needed to deal with some of the issues mentioned above. Our objective is to understand our clients' needs and serve as an aggregator of the information needed to solve their problems and meet their objectives rapidly and cost-effectively.

 
Prior to the Affordable Care Act ("ACA"), the mandated implementation of ICD-10-CM/PCS, and economic factors related to varying and uncertain reimbursement rates, if a healthcare organization were in financial distress, it would attempt a corporate renewal (turnaround) and employ recognized analytical tools, such as activity-based cost analysis, management reviews, review of capital structure, among other factors. To do so, such an organization might employ an interim manager to oversee the reorganization. Additionally it may have assembled a team of advisors, which could include lawyers, accountants, bankers, human resources experts, marketing experts, and possibly even liquidation consultants if turnaround is deemed too difficult. In the current healthcare climate, we feel it is necessary to consider the added dimension of how the organization can emerge from distress while adequately implementing the new regulations and concepts such as value based care.

 
Value-based care is a departure from fee-for-service care, where organizations are compensated for performing more services. Value based care envisions an organization or practitioner being rewarded for favorable outcomes. The challenge facing healthcare is how to measure and fairly compensate favorable outcomes. Because the research and policy suggestions in this area are rapidly evolving, we believe that our service as an aggregator and arbiter of information will be of value to our clients who may find it too difficult or not cost effective to do it on their own.

 
Our fees for such services will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis based of the scope of the work and duration of the engagement. Our officers have experience in long-term consulting at flat rate billing, although we do not currently have such clients. Under the terms of long term consulting contracts, in addition to a well-defined scope of services and deliverables, operational issues such as client's rules regarding access to premises, personnel, and intellectual property, changes in compensation relative to unexpected regulatory changes, premise relocation, and other potential changes attendant to long term relationships must be well defined in the initial contract.

 
Our Market
 
We believe the market for healthcare management services for providers, small hospitals and surgical centers not affiliated with larger organizations, which lack the time or proficiency to manage their facilities in a profitable manner, is underserved. We believe this to be especially true for the Oklahoma City area and the surrounding counties in Oklahoma due to the rural geography of the region and the many medical providers struggling to rapidly comply with new mandates, such as the implementation if ICD-10. Use of ICD-10 codes became effective on October 1, 2015, but the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid granted a one-year period where enforcement was relaxed while organizations adapted to the new standards. Now that the transition period has passed and most HIPPA-covered entities are functionally compliant, demand for initial training services has waned. The challenge going forward is to help entities analyze their progress by tracking key performance indicators (KPI) to address issues with reimbursement, claims submission and productivity. We believe that on-going training in ICD-10 is now a continuing (medical) education (CME) function, better served by entities that provide a wide array of CME courses such as the Oklahoma Association of Health Care Providers. Tracking and analyzing KPIs integrates with our other management services and adds more value. Examples of KPIs that are of immediate concern for a current client are medical necessity pass rate, incomplete or missing diagnosis codes, incomplete or missing charges, and number of records returned to clinicians for additional documentation.

We continue to focus our efforts regionally in Oklahoma County. However, when we are funded to a more stable degree, we intend to seek opportunities anywhere in the United States. We do not intend to compete internationally or with large national healthcare management companies whose primary focus is on large commercial firms, generally located in major urban areas.
 
Strategy
 
We offered our shares in a registered public offering that became effective on May 19, 2015, and are a reporting issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we believe will provide us with greater access to capital if investor interest in our business grows enough to eventually sustain a secondary trading market in our securities. Additionally, we believe that being a reporting issuer increases our credibility and visibility.
Seasonality
 
Although our operating history is limited, we have not experienced a seasonal business cycle.
 
Competition
 
The healthcare management business is competitive and among qualified participants has low barriers to entry. We compete locally, and will eventually compete on a statewide basis, with a variety of primarily local companies that offer similar services as ours. Based on our review of advertisements and Internet web sites, we believe the majority of these companies are entrenched in the conventional healthcare system and are themselves struggling to adapt to the new requirements of healthcare as defined by the emerging standards of accountable care. Others appear to be knowledgeable about the ICD-10 standards, coding, and their possible impact on reimbursement rates. We hope to form strategic alliances with companies that have demonstrable expertise in specialized areas. Some of these companies have had many more years of business experience, have proprietary processes, or have greater financial and personnel resources, including marketing and sales organizations, and may be able to provide their services at lower rates. We do not believe any one company holds a dominant share of the local or statewide market on which we are focused.
Compliance with Government Regulation
 
As a management firm, we are not subject to special licensure or certifications. Our employees may seek educational certifications, which are a way to demonstrate competency, not as a condition to perform services. The institutions for which we consult may be subject to varied and complex licensure requirements. We will assist these entities to stay in compliance with regulations. Examples of regulatory compliance are:

· | Certificates of Need 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Facility and professional licensure and certification 
· | Medicare and Medicaid certification – provider-based status, distinct part units, and hospitals within hospitals
· | Organizational policy and accreditation relating to emergency services 
· | Accreditation – JCAHO, AOA, and other national accreditation agencies 

Research and Development
 
We have incurred $Nil in research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years.

 
Intellectual Property
 
We do not currently have any intellectual property, other than our domain name and website, www.panamerahealth.com.

As of July 31, 2018, we have no employees. Other than our chief financial officer, who we have verbally agreed to pay for management services, our officers and directors are donating their time to the development of our company and are able to fulfil part-time requirements. We have no employees, and do not foresee hiring employees in the near future. We will be engaging independent contractors as needed who, under our direction, will fulfill the requirements of engagements that exceed our officers' time constraints.
