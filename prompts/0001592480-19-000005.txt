 Item 1. Business
Unless otherwise specified, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to "our," "we," "us," the "Company" and "our business" refer to Continental Building Products, Inc., in each case together with its consolidated subsidiaries.
General
We are a leading, high margin manufacturer of gypsum wallboard and complementary finishing products. Gypsum wallboard is a low-cost, widely used building product for interior and exterior walls and ceilings in residential and commercial structures. It is highly regarded for its ease and speed of application and its superior performance in providing comfort, fire resistance and thermal and sound insulation. The principal sources of demand for gypsum wallboard are residential construction, repair and remodel ("R&R"), and commercial construction. The commercial construction market encompasses areas such as office, retail, healthcare, hospitality and government building projects.
Our manufacturing facilities and sales efforts are concentrated in the eastern United States and eastern Canada. We estimate that in 2018 our market share in the United States east of the Mississippi River, a market which accounted for more than 55% of total U.S. wallboard demand, was approximately 18%, and our share is significantly higher in many of the major metropolitan areas within a shipping radius of 300 miles of our facilities, which include New York, Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Indianapolis, Nashville, Jacksonville and Hartford.
We estimate that new residential and R&R construction accounted for more than 80% of 2018 industry wallboard demand. Demand for gypsum wallboard is cyclical and closely follows construction industry cycles, particularly housing construction. For example, U.S. housing starts fell from a peak of 2.1 million in 2005 to a 50-year low of 554,000 in 2009. Correspondingly, U.S. wallboard consumption declined by more than 50% from 36.2 billion square feet, or bsf, in 2005 to a low of 17.1 bsf in 2010. Recently, the U.S. housing market has experienced moderate growth. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. housing starts reached 1.17 million in 2016 and 1.20 million in 2017. According to the February 2019 Blue Chip Economic Indicators report housing starts are estimated to be 1.26 million in 2018. This drove wallboard consumption to 24.7 bsf, 25.3 bsf and 24.9 bsf, for 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. We believe that there is room for continued improvement in housing starts. Housing starts have averaged 1.44 million over the past 50 years, which is approximately 14% greater than the 2018 starts of 1.26 million.
The effects of market conditions on our operations are further discussed in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
We strive to be a low cost producer of gypsum wallboard. We have adopted a strategy of lean manufacturing and continuous improvement, which we call the Bison Way, as one of the tools we use in attempting to eliminate waste and become more efficient in all aspects of our business.
Continental Building Products, Inc. was founded in 2013 when it was acquired from Lafarge North America. Prior to that, it operated as the gypsum division of Lafarge North America from 1996 to 2013. Lafarge North America founded its U.S. wallboard business in 1996 when it acquired two manufacturing facilities, including our Buchanan plant, from Georgia Pacific.
Products and Customers
We offer our customers a full range of gypsum wallboard products, including LiftLite ®, our lightweight product designed to be easier to lift and install, our Mold Defense ® line of products designed for enhanced protection against mold and mildew, and our Weather Defense ® line of moisture and mold-resistant exterior sheathing. To complement our wallboard business and to better serve our customers, we also operate a finishing products business that manufactures a comprehensive line of joint compounds at our plant in Silver Grove (Kentucky) and our joint compound plant in Chambly (Quebec). We provide superior customer service based on customer needs, consistently delivering high quality finished product and providing orders accurately with fast delivery times. Certain customers and markets have also favored the use of synthetic gypsum products, which we manufacture, versus natural gypsum products for the additional benefit of receiving Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, ratings to support environmentally responsible initiatives.
Our marketing and sales strategy consists of targeted direct sales efforts to existing and potential customers using an experienced sales force. We operate a single centralized customer-service call center. We also have a centralized logistics team for all of our operations that manages freight, storage and other distribution-related tasks. As is customary in the industry, we do not enter into long-term agreements with our customers. To encourage our customers to order our products and to increase their loyalty, we offer incentive programs, which provide for customer rebates that are triggered when specified sales volumes or net sales are reached. We generally bear the cost of delivering our finished products to our customers. We deliver by truck 
4

and, in the case of our Silver Grove and Palatka plants, by truck and rail. At each of our facilities, we have one or two carriers under contract that provide the majority of our shipping services.
We regularly achieve high rankings in customer service surveys and have received numerous "supplier of the year" awards from major customers. We consistently provide a high level of service to our customers through a combination of product availability and quality, on-time delivery, and timely and accurate invoicing. We sell our products through several different channels, including gypsum wallboard distributors, buying groups, wholesalers and mass merchants. Lowes, our largest customer, represented 13%, 14% and 15% of our net sales in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Foundation Building Materials represented 11% of our net sales in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. L&W represented 10% of our net sales in the year ended December 31, 2018. No other customer represented more than 10% of our net sales in any of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
Manufacturing and Distribution
We operate highly efficient and automated manufacturing facilities in Silver Grove (Kentucky), Palatka (Florida) and Buchanan (New York) that produce a full range of gypsum wallboard products for our diversified customer base. We are committed to operational excellence and have invested heavily in our facilities, which we believe are among the newest, largest and most efficient wallboard plants in North America.
Gypsum wallboard is manufactured by mixing finely ground, partially dehydrated, or calcined, gypsum with water and forming the resulting slurry between two layers of continuous paperboard liner. It is allowed to harden briefly before being dried and cut to specification.
The manufacturing process is tightly controlled to achieve uniformity and desired board characteristics. Additives can be introduced to the slurry at the beginning of the process to give the resulting board enhanced properties. For instance, fiberglass can be added to enhance fire resistance or fungicides added to defend against mold. Additives are also used to control the manufacturing process and to counteract impurities occurring in the gypsum.
Gypsum can be either natural or synthetic. We use predominantly synthetic gypsum in our wallboard products, which we believe enhances our manufacturing quality and consistency, reduces production costs and provides important environmental benefits relative to natural gypsum. Synthetic gypsum is principally produced through a process known as flue gas desulfurization, or FGD. The FGD process typically takes place in scrubbing towers in coal-fired power plants. Our strategically positioned plants provide us with two key benefits: cost-effective access to our primary supplies of synthetic gypsum, which reduces our inbound transportation costs, and close proximity to many major metropolitan areas, which decreases our product delivery costs. Natural gypsum is a mineral mined in select areas throughout North America.
We purchase the majority of our synthetic gypsum supplies from coal-fired power plants with operations near, or easily accessible to, our wallboard facilities. To secure our primary supplies of synthetic gypsum, we have entered into long-term agreements with major suppliers with remaining terms (with extensions) ranging from approximately 10 years to 31 years. Our supply contracts typically provide for a base price with escalation provisions. We supplement our long term gypsum supply agreements with a variety of shorter term agreements, including spot market purchases and short term agreements with terms that extend for several years. Each of our plants obtains its gypsum from multiple sources. Our current supply agreements fulfill our current gypsum requirements. We believe that we would be able to purchase additional synthetic gypsum on the open market to the extent any production increases require it.
Our Seven Hills joint venture with WestRock Company, or WestRock, provides us with a reliable source of high-quality paperboard liner required for consistent wallboard production. We therefore have a long-term supply agreement that fulfills most of our current paper requirements. The Seven Hills joint venture has the capacity to supply us with approximately 80% of our paper needs at our full capacity.
Our manufacturing processes utilize significant amounts of natural gas and electricity. We purchase both natural gas and electricity on the open market. We use derivative instruments to manage certain commodity price and interest rate exposures. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes, and we typically do not hedge beyond one year. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for additional information regarding our financial exposures.
Our wallboard facilities are located in close proximity to major metropolitan areas in the eastern United States and eastern Canada, lowering both our inbound and outbound transportation costs and facilitating timely delivery to our customers. Each of our facilities allows us to offer same-day delivery service to many of our key metropolitan markets, including our Buchanan plant, which provides same-day delivery service to customers in the New York City tri-state area, which management believes provides us with a competitive advantage.

Competition
The market for our wallboard and finishing products is highly competitive. We believe the key competitive factors in the market include:

• | price;


• | service;


• | product quality; and


• | product range.

There are currently seven gypsum wallboard manufacturers in the United States: USG, National Gypsum, Georgia-Pacific, CertainTeed, Eagle Materials, Pabco Gypsum, and us. Of these, we believe only six compete in the eastern United States. Gypsum wallboard has a high weight-to-value ratio, so it is advantageous to both source raw materials and produce gypsum wallboard in close proximity to where it is used. If manufacturing facilities are not located in close proximity to end markets, transportation costs can render the cost of finished goods uncompetitive compared to locally manufactured wallboard. Accordingly, competition in the industry occurs principally on a regional basis. Each competitive geographic region has a different group of manufacturers and customers and, as a result, a different competitive landscape. A number of our competitors are larger than us and may have greater resources or lower costs of capital than we do.
Although gypsum wallboard remains a regional industry, consolidation in the industry has resulted in increased market share for certain industry participants, including us. In 1997 there were thirteen gypsum wallboard producers, compared to seven in 2018. This consolidation has occurred almost entirely amongst the smaller producers. Since 1997, our national market share has grown from 3% to 11%.
Seasonality
Sales of our wallboard products are, similar to many building products, seasonal in that sales are generally slightly higher from spring through autumn when construction activity is greatest in our markets.
Employees
We had 645 employees as of December 31, 2018. Some of our employees at our Buchanan wallboard plant, representing approximately 12% of our workforce, are represented by two unions. The collective bargaining agreements with these two unions will expire on November 30, 2020. Our remaining employees are non-union. We believe our relationships with both our union and non-union employees are good.
Intellectual Property
We maintain many trademarks for our wallboard and finishing products, including, among others, LiftLite ®, Firecheck ®, Mold Defense ® and Rapid Coat ®. We also rely on patents and trade secret law to protect some of our manufacturing processes. Loss of one or more of our patents, trademarks or licenses would not have a material impact on our business or our ability to continue our operations in the foreseeable future.
Environmental Matters
Our wallboard and finishing products businesses are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment. Some of these laws, such as the federal Clean Air Act and the federal Clean Water Act (and analogous state laws), impose environmental permitting obligations and govern the nature and amount of emissions that may be generated. Some laws, such as the Federal Superfund law (and analogous state laws), impose obligations to clean up or remediate spills of hazardous materials into the environment. Some laws, such as the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, (and analogous state laws), impose obligations on us with respect to the management of waste products. None of our operations are the subject of any material local, state or federal environmental proceedings or inquiries. We do not, and have not, used asbestos in any of our products.
Our manufacturing processes for wallboard use a significant amount of energy, especially natural gas. Increased regulation of energy use to address the possible emission of greenhouse gases and climate change could materially increase our manufacturing costs. Enactment of new climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the U.S. Congress or various states, or the adoption of additional regulations by the EPA and analogous state or Canadian governmental agencies that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, legislation has been introduced proposing a "carbon tax" on energy use or establishing a so-called "cap and trade" system. Such legislation would likely increase the cost of energy 
6

and therefore could materially increase our manufacturing costs. See Risk Factors for information regarding the possible effects that compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have on our business and operating results.
