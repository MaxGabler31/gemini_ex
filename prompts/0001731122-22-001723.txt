Overview
 
Bangfu Technology Group Co., Ltd. (the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our” and similar terminology) was incorporated under the name “Kelinda” in the state of Nevada on December 18, 2017 to create health related applications. The Company’s first project was to develop a mobile application (the “App”) for free test panels to identify general health conditions and targeted diseases for both children and adults. The main purpose of the App was to remind users of doctor’s appointments and examinations. The App synchronized with Google and Apple calendars and sent notifications regarding pills-taking time, required tests or doctor appointments via the App and email. We expected to generate revenue from in-app subscriptions. Prior to the Change of Control as defined below, we had developed terms of reference, design of our application, creation of an Apple store account and were at the server and application development stage.


Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”), entered into as of March 16, 2020, by and between Fuming Yang (the “Purchaser”) and Petru Afanasenco, Andrei Afanasenco and Yuriy Turchynskyy, as the representative of certain stockholders (collectively, the “Sellers”) of the Company, the Sellers sold an aggregate of 7,948,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company to the Purchaser in consideration for an aggregate purchase price of $330,000 in cash from the Purchaser’s personal funds (the “Transaction”). Following consummation of the Transaction, the Purchaser holds approximately 99% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. The Transaction resulted in a change in control (“Change in Control”) of the Company from the Sellers to the Purchaser. In connection with the Transaction, Petru Afanasenco, the President and director of the Company, and Andrei Afanasenco, the Secretary and Treasurer of the Company, both resigned from all of their director and officer positions with the Company, effective immediately upon the consummation of the Transaction.
 
On June 3, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to effect a change in the name of the Company from “Kelinda” to “Bangfu Technology Group Co., Ltd.”, effective upon filing. In connection with its name change, the Company’s ticker symbol on the OTC Pink Market was changed from “KLDA” to “BFGX.”
 
Following this Change in Control, the Company changed its business plan to engage in online business services in the People’s Republic of China. The Company plans to engage in developments of personal daily life assistance mobile applications, online educational trainings, and employment recruitment services in China. The Company plans to first roll out the plan with a focus on the tier-3 and tier-4 cities in the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi in China. The Company is presently evaluating the optimal corporate and legal structures in China necessary to establish and implement these business plans. The Company aims to start implementing these business plans in the near term but its ability to execute on its business plans and initiatives will depend upon the development of the pandemic, including the duration and spread of the COVID-19 and lockdown restrictions imposed by the respective various governments and oversight bodies in China.  
 
From the Change of Control to the date of this Report, the Company has not commenced its planned business and presently has no business operations, revenues or assets and thus is and has been a “shell company” as defined by Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1993, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Company does not have an established timetable to implement our business plan, and until it does, the Company will remain a shell company.
