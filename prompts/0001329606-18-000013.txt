Item 1.  Business.
General
 
We are headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, designs, builds and markets clean energy products focused on energy efficiency for a better, cleaner, and environmentally sustainable future. The Companys principal product is the Clean CycleTM generator, offered through its wholly owned subsidiary Clean Energy HRS LLC dba Heat Recovery Solutions, Inc., (HRS or Heat Recovery Systems). The Clean CycleTM generator captures waste heat from a variety of sources and turns it into electricity that users can use or sell back to the grid. By using our Clean CycleTM generator commercial and industrial heat generators boost their overall energy efficiency by approximately 12%, and the savings created provide our customers with a return on their investment within 3-4 years, depending on the installation and local energy prices. Our product saves fuel, reduces pollution and requires very little maintenance. Our goal is to position CETY to become a worldwide leader in the energy efficiency market.
Organic Rankine Cycle System Using Clean Cycle Generator

The Rankine Cycle is a thermodynamic cycle that converts heat into energy. The organic Rankine cycle is similar. Heat from an industrial waste source is passed through a heat exchanger where it superheats cold fluid that is vaporized. The vapor is passed through an expansion device (turbine or other expander) which creates electricity, and then through a condenser where the vapor is re-condensed to liquid and cooled. The cycle repeats itself generating energy. 

We produce a turnkey Organic Rankine Cycle system we call the Clean CycleTM generator. Our Clean Cycle TM generators create additional power from waste heat with no additional emission and come in two models, skids for use inside a plant or containers for outdoor applications. Our customers may use their own heat exchangers or condensers or we provide these products as part of our integrated system through third party suppliers.
 We compete based on efficiency, maintenance and our customers return on investment. We have an exclusive license from Calnetix to use their magnetic turbine for heat waste recovery applications. We believe that the magnetic turbine technology is more efficient than our competitors turbines which allows our systems to generate more electricity at lower heat ranges. Because our generator is magnetic, it requires far less maintenance

than our competitors who use oil, gearbox and rubber seals in their turbines. We have the advantage of selling a system that was originally manufactured and sold by General Electric International so our Clean CycleTM generator has a substantial market base and we believe has a reputation as one of the defacto standards in the market. 

Our greatest advantage is that the Clean CycleTM generator is a product that can be delivered on a turnkey basis, not a major project that needs to be designed, manufactured and installed. We believe that this is one of the most distinguishing features of our Clean Cycle generator, as it significantly reduces the time our customers spend on installation, improves the speed with which we can deliver our product and reduces startup costs. 

Corporate History

We were incorporated in California in July 1995 under the name Probe Manufacturing Industries, Inc.  We redomiciled to Nevada in April 2005 under the name Probe Manufacturing, Inc. We manufactured electronics and provided services to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of industrial, automotive, semiconductor, medical, communication, military, and high technology products  On September 11, 2015 Clean Energy HRS, our wholly owned subsidiary acquired the assets of Heat Recovery Solutions from General Electric International  In November 2015, we changed our name to Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. 
Our Products

Our CE HRS subsidiary provides clean energy and environmentally sustainable technology solutions to companies through the offering of heat recovery solutions products. The Companys principal product offering currently is the Clean CycleTM generator. The Clean Cycle generator converts heat from a variety of sources into clean, affordable electricity.

Our Clean CycleTM  generator generates electricity from any heat source, typically through a heat exchanger and a closed loop hot water or steam loop directed to the Clean CycleTM  generator. The process by which the Clean CycleTM  generator generates electricity is called the Organic Rankine Cycle. 

Our Clean CycleTM  generator: 

·
  requires no fuel, 
 ·
 produces no emissions, and 
 ·
 is closed loop, meaning it has feedback control within the system. 
 ·
 Meticulously engineered and improved by General Electric International and 
 ·
 is available in a complete package for indoor, outdoor and remote sites. 

The major components are delivered as a complete turnkey package and include, the Integrated Power Module (IPM), our patented the magnetic bearing turbine, the electronics controls with the ancillary mechanical parts, packaged inside a container when used outdoors. The condenser comes as a separate piece which is purchased by either us or our customer through third party manufactures and attaches to the top of the container. Once the condenser is attached to the container all that is left to do is attach the container to the heat source, and it is ready to produce energy. 
 Due to the low amount of moving parts the IPM is a minimal maintenance solution, that requires no oils, no lubricants, no external rotating seals, and does not require manned operation. The whole package (except condenser) is mounted inside a 20ft shipping container. The Condenser comes as a separate piece and attaches to the top of the container. Once the condenser is attached to the container all that is left to do is attach the container to the heat source, and it is ready to produce energy.

The Clean Cycle Containerized Generator

Clean CycleTM generator and the Organic Rankine Cycle 

The Organic Rankine Cycle is a thermodynamic process where heat is transferred to a fluid at a constant pressure. The fluid inside the generator is vaporized and then expanded in a vapor turbine that drives a turbine generator, producing electricity. The spent vapor is condensed to liquid and recycled back through the cycle.

Its applications include power generation from solar, geothermal and waste heat sources. According to an article in Distributed Energy, a leading industry magazine, Organic Rankine Cycle systems are most useful for waste heat recovery. Waste heat recovery can be applied to a variety of low­ to medium temperature heat streams. 

We have used our Clean Cycle Containerized Generator in Marshall Island for Marshall Electric Company to offset engine fuel use and produce additional electricity. The two cycle generators will generate an estimated 184kW of net electrical power from the heat of exiting engines. The clean cycle units, which require no added fuel and produce no additional emissions, are expected to displace 3.5 million liters of fuel and 10,000 metric tons of CO2. Our products are be particularly useful in nations where the cost of energy is high, and the savings rapidly offset the cost of their fuel and reduce emissions.

We currently hold 15 patents in 6 countries and 28 pending applications in 8 countries, which was acquired from General Electric International. Majority of our materials and components are procured domestically from mechanical and electrical suppliers. We have in-house electro-mechanical assembly and testing capabilities. Our products are compliant with American Society of Mechanical Engineers and are UL and CE approved.

We are currently in default on the payment of the purchase price pursuant to our asset purchase agreement with General Electric International due to a combination of our inability to raise sufficient capital as expected and our belief that we are entitled to a reduction in purchase price we paid. We are in the process of negotiations with General Electric International. .

Our Market
 
The world currently faces fundamental problems with its energy supply, which are due primarily to the reliance on fossil fuels. The economic prosperity of the wealthiest nations in the twentieth century was built on a ready supply of inexpensive fossil fuel and developing nations have continued in the twenty-first century to consume fossil fuel reserves at an ever increasing rate. This has led to worldwide reserve depletions, indicating that both oil and gas are likely to be effectively exhausted before the end of this century. Only coal reserves are expected to last into the next century. Yet even if fossil fuel supplies were unconstrained, their continued use poses its own problems. All fossil fuel combustion produces carbon dioxide, which appears to result in the warming of the earth's atmosphere with profound environmental implications across the globe.
 
These problems have resulted in the realization that the world must both increase the efficiency of its utilization of fossil fuels and decrease its reliance upon them. Environmental issues related to fossil fuel combustion were began to be noticed during the 1980s with the advent of acid rain, a product of the sulfur and nitrogen emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Power plants were forced by legislation and economic measures to control these emissions. However it is the recognition of global warming that presents the most serious challenge because carbon dioxide exists at much higher levels in the flue gases of power plants and major types of industrial manufacturing facilities than sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.
 
Although renewable energy capacity offers a hedge against major price rises because most renewable technologies exploit a source of energy that is freely available, many renewable technologies today still rely on government subsidies to make them competitive. Governments may also impose penalties upon companies, such as carbon trading schemes, which discourage the use of fossil fuels or increase its costs by imposing stringent emissions limits.
 
Given the international concerns regarding global warming and pollution and the need to more efficiently utilize fossil fuels, we believe that there exists substantial worldwide demand and a growing market for our Clean Cycle TM generators that can enable companies to generate greater amounts of energy from the same supply of fossil fuels and that also reduce the amount of harmful emissions that would otherwise be released from the combustion of those fossil fuels. Our technologies, including our Clean Cycle TM generators, could benefit companies by both reducing energy costs and mitigating possible emissions penalties.

The market for waste heat recovery is well defined and, according to a recent report published by the U.S. Department of Energy Waste Heat recovery: Technology and Opportunities in US Industry and International Energy Agency report, World Energy Outlook 2012 ,  20 to 50% of industrial energy input is lost as waste heat. and ~3/5 of the primary energy used in power plants becomes waste heat. The opportunity in the waste heat recovery market is substantial. The report continues, A valuable alternative approach to improving overall energy efficiency is to capture and reuse the lost or waste heat that is intrinsic to all manufacturing processes. During these manufacturing processes, as much as 20% to 50% of the energy consumed is ultimately lost via waste heat contained in streams of hot exhaust gases and liquids, as well as through heat conduction, convection, and radiation from hot equipment surfaces and from heated product streams. In some cases, such as industrial furnaces, waste heat recovery can improve energy efficiency by 10% to as much as 50%.
The advantage of recapturing and utilizing waste heat is that it typically replaces purchased electric power, much of which does and will continue to require burning fossil fuels, or directly replaces fuels which must be purchased and combusted. Thus it actually can directly reduce emissions and eliminate transmission losses. Projections of market potential are truly enormous, with unrecovered waste heat in industrial processes estimated at half a quintillion (a billion billion) BTUs. The Company believes that if it can capture even a small percentage of this market it would have a strong opportunity to reduce exhaust emissions, assist in lowering energy costs of the manufacturers, while growing the Company and its client base.

Going Concern

10

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a total stockholders deficit of $4,113,182 and a working capital deficit of $5,547,652 and a net loss of $2,214,854 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The company also had an accumulated deficit of $8,789,718 as of December 31, 2017 and used $1,495,470 in net cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its goals and reach profitable operations and is still dependent upon its ability (1) to obtain sufficient debt and/or equity capital and/or (2) to generate positive cash flow from operations.

Our operating results are affected by a number of factors, including the following:
 
·
 changes in the macro-economic environment and related changes in electricity & fuel cost;
 ·
 the effects on our business when our customers are not successful in marketing their products and solutions;
 ·
 the effects of government and municipality regulations impeding growth;
 
Competition

The competitors with our Clean CycleTM II Generators are Organic Rankine Cycle generator manufacturers such as Turboden, Ormat and some start-ups with fewer installations and some engine competitors aligning with ORC such as Wartsila, Caterpillar, and Cummins. Our product was designed by General Electric International and maintains its history and association with a major brand, however Clean CycleTM II is currently branded under CETY an entrepreneurial company with a proven product and technology. Our product is distinguished from its competitors by its magnetic bearing turbine technology offering lower maintenance and higher efficiency of 12% for under 500kW applications with low to medium temperature requirements. We have more than 1,000,000 fleet operating hours and 8 years of history in the field. 
Employees 
 
We presently have approximately 10 employees, including production, program management, materials management, engineering, sales, quality, and administrative and management personnel. We have never experienced work stoppages and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement.  
Government Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to certain foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental, waste management, and health and safety matters. We believe we operate in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements. However, material costs and liabilities may arise from these requirements or from new, modified or more stringent requirements. Material cost may rise due to additional manufacturing cost of raw or made parts with the application of new regulations. Our liabilities may also increase due to additional regulations imposed by foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental, waste management, and health and safety matters. In addition, our past, current and future operations and those of businesses we acquire, may give rise to claims of exposure by employees or the public or to other claims or liabilities relating to environmental, waste management or health and safety concerns.
 
Our markets can be positively or negatively impacted by the effects of governmental and regulatory matters. We are affected not only by energy policy, laws, regulations and incentives of governments in the markets into which we sell, but also by rules, regulations and costs imposed by utilities. Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers on the installation of our product or the interconnection of the product with the electric grid. Further, utility companies may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site power generation, thereby reducing the electricity they take from the utility, or for having the capacity to use power from the grid for back-up or standby purposes. These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our products or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems in the future. This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and profitability potential. In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our future 

11

operations. These costs, incentives and rules are not always the same as those faced by technologies with which we compete. However, rules, regulations, laws and incentives could also provide an advantage to our Heat Recovery Solutions as compared with competing technologies if we are able to achieve required compliance at a lower cost when our Clean Cycle TM generators are commercialized. Additionally, reduced emissions and higher fuel efficiency could help our future customers combat the effects of global warming. Accordingly, we may benefit from increased government regulations that impose tighter emission and fuel efficiency standards.

 Research and Development
 
We had no expenses in Research and Development costs during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017.
