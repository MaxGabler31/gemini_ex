Our Compounds Licensed from BioLite
 
We currently are granted from BioLite the sole licensing rights to develop six compounds for therapeutic purposes. Below is the description of each of the six compounds.
 

I. | ABV- 1501 Triple Negative Breast Cancer - Combination therapy for Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ABV- 1501 is developed from BLI-1401-2 whose active pharmaceutical ingredient is Yukiguni Maitake Extract 404. MSKCC conducted the Phase I clinical trial of a polysaccharide extract from Grifola frondosa (Maitake mushroom), which is very similar to Yukiguni Maitake Extract 404. The Phase I trial focused on Grifola frondosa extract’s immunological effects on breast cancer patients. The results of the Phase I trial showed that oral administration of a polysaccharide extract from Maitake mushroom is associated with both immunologically stimulatory and inhibitory measurable effects in peripheral blood. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application of ABV-1501 for the Phase II clinical trials referenced with MSKCC Maitake and such Phase II IND was approved in March 2016 by the U.S. FDA. 
● | We are currently speaking with a medical center located in California, United States respecting potential cooperation opportunities on ABV-1501’s Phase II clinical study. 


II. | ABV-1502 Solid Tumor with Anti-PD1 - Combination therapy for solid tumors with Anti-PD1 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In addition to ABV-1501, we plan to develop ABV-1501 for the potential treatment of solid tumor with anti-PD1, which is also derived from Maitake mushroom extract. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Currently, we are coordinating with a U.S. health center to prepare the Phase I IND package for ABV-1502.

As stated above, ABV-1501 and ABV-1502 share the same Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient, Maitake mushroom extract. IND and study details are as follows:
 

● | During the Phase I/II clinical trial of Maitake mushroom extract, a total of 34 eligible study subjects were enrolled from March 2004 to January 2007. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability. The test drug was orally administrated and a polysaccharide extract from Maitake mushroom was associated with both immunologically stimulatory and inhibitory measurable effects in peripheral blood. The IND number is 68853 and MSKCC received filing confirmation from the FDA on Jan 22, 2004. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Generally, Phase I clinical trials are performed with healthy subjects to test for safety and Phase II clinical trials are performed with patient subjects for efficacy as well as safety. However, trials of cancer-related drugs must involve subjects with the targeted cancer, and as such, Phase I/II studies involving cancer patients include primary endpoints of safety and tolerability and a secondary endpoint of efficacy.
 

III. | ABV-1503 Combination therapy for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) 
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are currently preparing the IND package for the Phase II clinical study of Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) for CLL. BioLite is preparing the Compound IP for the Chemistry, Manufacture, and Control (CMC) part of the IND. We and MSKCC are collaborating to design the protocols for the clinical trials and the IRB documents. The trial period, test subject number, primary and secondary endpoint and method of administration have not been decided yet, and are still being negotiated between us and MSKCC. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We are cooperating with MSKCC to prepare a clinical trial agreement once the IND of ABV-1503 is approved by the U.S. FDA. 


IV. | ABV-1504 Major Depressive Disorder - Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | This is Polygala extract for the potential treatment of Major Depressive Disorder 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | BioLite performed Phase I clinical trial of ABV-1504 and has obtained US FDA Phase II Part One/Part Two IND approval. The results of Phase II Part One clinical trial of ABV-1504 are described below. 
● | We started the Phase II Part Two clinical trial of ABV-1504 in the third quarter of 2016 and the study is being conducted in the following sites in Taiwan: Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei City Hospital (Songde Branch), Tri-Service General Hospital and Wan Fang Hospital. We plan to commence such clinical trial at Stanford University in the United States soon. 


V. | ABV-1505 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”) 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | This is Polygala extract for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | BioLite has obtained U.S. FDA approval for our IND application of Phase II study of ABV-1505 on January 25, 2016, and is currently negotiating with qualified medical sites and research institutions for Phase II clinical trials. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Market Opportunity and Growth Strategy/Business Plan
 
ABVC focuses on the development of new drugs and innovative medical devices to fulfill unmet medical needs. The business model of ABVC includes integrating research achievements from world-renowned medical research institutions, such as MSKCC and MD Anderson Cancer Center, conducting clinical trials of translational medicine for proof of concept (“POC”), out-licensing to international pharmaceutical companies and indirectly getting involved in the global market opportunities. In the United States, any qualified clinic can conduct clinical trials. We currently strive to continue collaborating with top medical research institutions. However, if for any reason we cannot maintain the collaboration with any of such medical centers, we will select qualified clinics to further develop our new drug and medical device products in the pipeline. Our primary goal is to pursue collaborations with top medical centers.
 
Our business plan is to conduct and complete Phase II clinical trials for all of our products in the pipeline in the US and/or Canada. If we obtain satisfactory results in the Phase II clinical trial for any such compounds or BFC-1401, we will seek strategic partners to out-license any such compounds tor BFC-1401 to established pharmaceutical companies for further development. Furthermore, we will continue to search for potential products (drugs or medical devices) worldwide to expand our product pipeline for their research and development in North America.

-

 

The competitive advantages of our business model include:
 
1. Once we successfully complete POC of any product in the pipeline, we will seek strategic partners, such as respected pharmaceutical companies in the United States and boutique qualified clinics, to co-develop such mature product. In consideration for our licensing of the mature product, we expect to receive capital which we plan to use for our research and development of other products in the pipeline or selection of other new drugs or medical devices.
 
2. Sublicensing our products that pass Phase II clinic trials to other pharmaceutical companies saves us the time and resources to conduct Phase III clinical trials and provides a quick return on our investment in our products.
 
3. We have six new drug products related to central nervous system and cancers and one new medical device for vitreous substitutes under development. This development portfolio diversifies our research risks by focusing on three different medical fields.
 
We are currently negotiating with potential medical center partners regarding conducting clinical trials on certain compounds in our pipeline. Furthermore, certain international pharmaceutical companies have contacted us to express their interest in certain of our licensed compounds. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will find a qualified medical center to conduct clinical trials of any of our new drug products or enter into a definitive licensing agreement with any pharmaceutical companies.
 
In accordance with the Collaboration Agreement with BioLite and Addendum and pursuant to existing practice, we own all intellectual property rights to the six products developed in Canada and the U.S. BioLite owns all intellectual property developed with respect to the six products developed outside Canada and the U.S. We have the right to sublicense our intellectual property to develop such products in Canada and the U.S.
 
Currently, we are in the process of developing seven products and will continue searching for other new drug candidates and medical device candidates for further development and ultimate licensing for Phase III development by the sub-licensees.

Government Regulation
 
Regulations by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries are a significant factor in developing manufacturing and marketing of our pharmaceutical products. The nature and extent to which such regulation applies to us may vary depending on the nature of our products. We anticipate that many, if not all, of our products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. Our products are subject to rigorous pre-clinical testing and clinical trials and other approval procedures of the FDA, and similar regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries. Various governmental statutes and regulations also govern or influence clinical trials, Chemistry, Manufacture and Control (CMC) related to such products and their marketing. The approval process and subsequent compliance with related statutes and regulations require substantial time and capital commitment, and there can be no guarantee that approvals will be granted.
 
U.S. FDA Approval Process and other U.S. Regulatory Authorities 
 
Prior to commencement of clinical studies, pre-clinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in laboratories to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the new drug candidate. The results of these studies are submitted to the FDA as a part of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before clinical trials. Typically, clinical trials involve a time-consuming and costly three-phase process. Phase I clinical trials are conducted on a small number of healthy human subjects to establish safety pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within subjects’ bodies. Phase II clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with the target disease that the new drug is designed to treat in order to determine preliminary efficacy, possible dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial clinical trial is conducted on diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety and patterns of drug metabolism and distribution, in which case such trial is referred to as a Phase I/II trial. Phase III clinical trials are large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials that are conducted on patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing; and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data which have been accumulated to a point whereby the risk/benefit ratio of the new drug candidate is below certain level. Monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA.
 
The results of the pre-clinical and clinical testing on a non-biologic drug and certain diagnostic drugs are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for approval prior to commencement of commercial sales. In responding to an NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or refuse to approve if the FDA determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria. There can be no assurance that approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, for any of our proposed products.
 
We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and recommendations relating to the treatment of oocyte donors, the manufacturing environment under which human cells for therapy are derived, safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents. We cannot accurately predict the influence on our research operations caused by regulatory changes .
 
European and Other Regulatory Approval
 
Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries will likely be necessary prior to commencement of marketing such product in such countries. The regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval, or may require additional data before approving it, even though the relevant product has been approved by the FDA or another authority. The regulatory authorities in the European Union (“EU”), Australia and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products. The process for gaining an approval in a particular country may vary from the process in another country, but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for FDA approval. In Europe, the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products provides a mechanism for EU-member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensing. The EU has established a European agency for the evaluation of medical products, with both a centralized community procedure and a decentralized procedure, the latter being based on the principle of licensing within one member country followed by mutual recognition by the other member countries.
Employees
 
we have nine full-time employees and one consultant. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization and we consider our relationship with our employees good.
