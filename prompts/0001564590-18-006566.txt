 Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company applying a precision medicine approach to developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases. Precision medicine refers to the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient through the ability to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology and/or prognosis of those diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment.  Our lead product candidate, Gencaro™ (bucindolol hydrochloride), is an investigational, pharmacologically unique beta-blocker and mild vasodilator that we are developing for the potential treatment of patients with chronic heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, or HFrEF, who also have atrial fibrillation, or AF, or at risk of developing AF.  HFrEF constitutes an estimated 50-60% of the total heart failure, or HF, population, with the remainder comprised of HF with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF.  We believe that Gencaro’s efficacy is enhanced in a specific genotype that is present in approximately fifty percent of the general population in the United States, and can be identified by a genetic test. We believe that with this genetic test, we may be able to predict individual patient response to Gencaro, potentially improving the efficacy of treatment for AF in HFrEF patients with this particular genotype.  We believe that Gencaro, if approved, could potentially be a safer and more effective therapy for treating or preventing AF in patients with HFrEF and could be the first genetically-targeted AF treatment. We also believe that Gencaro may have market exclusivity based on patents and new chemical entity status, if approved in the United States, Europe or other markets.
 In February 2018, we reported the results of our Phase 2B clinical superiority trial, known as GENETIC-AF, in which we evaluated Gencaro for the treatment and prevention of AF in patients with HFrEF.  The GENETIC-AF trial only enrolled patients with the beta‑1 389 arginine homozygous genotype.  In our trial, HFrEF is defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction, or LVEF, of less than 50%.  GENETIC-AF compared Gencaro to TOPROL-XL (metoprolol succinate), a drug approved for treating HFrEF that is also prescribed, but not approved, for treating AF in patients with HFrEF.  Overall, Gencaro demonstrated a similar treatment benefit 
 1

compared to the active comparator, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL-XL). In U.S. patients (127 of 267 total patients), a trend for potential superior benefit in favor of Gencaro (approximately 30% risk reduction over TOPROL-XL), was observed for the primary endpoint of time to recurrence of AF. Additionally, in U.S. patients, Gencaro demonstrated a trend for potential superior benefit in favor of Gencaro (approximately 51% risk reduction over TOPROL-XL) in a subset of patients who underwent continuous heart rhythm monitoring with Medtronic implanted devices. Safety data indicated that Gencaro was generally safe and well-tolerated in the AF/HF population investigated with a safety profile similar to TOPROL-XL.
GENETIC-AF enrolled 267 patients from the United States, Canada and Europe. The primary analysis was conducted to evaluate the evidence of safety and superior efficacy of Gencaro versus an active comparator, TOPROL-XL. The primary endpoint of the trial was time to recurrent AF, atrial flutter, or AFL, or all-cause mortality, or ACM. The trial was not powered to conventional significance for this endpoint and utilized Bayesian statistical modeling of predictive probability of success, or PPoS, of the primary endpoint to estimate outcome if the trial had enrolled 620 patients with 330 primary events.
 Overall, Gencaro demonstrated a similar treatment benefit compared to the active comparator, TOPROL-XL (143 total events, hazard ratio of 1.01 [95% confidence interval: 0.71, 1.42]), which was associated with a PPoS of 14%. In the U.S. patient cohort of 127 patients (approximately 50% of all patients and events), a trend for potential superior benefit in favor of Gencaro over TOPROL-XL was observed (73 events, hazard ratio 0.70, [95% confidence interval: 0.41, 1.19]), with a PPoS of 61%, which was greater than the prespecified criteria set by us to proceed to Phase 3 development. We believe the difference in treatment effects between the overall and U.S. patient cohorts was primarily due to results in two non-U.S. countries exhibiting hazard ratios >1.0. The differences between patients enrolled at these sites versus the United States and other country cohorts are being investigated.
 A subgroup of patients underwent continuous (24/7) heart rhythm monitoring via Medtronic implanted loop recorders or other Medtronic implanted therapeutic devices (e.g., ICDs, CRTs) to evaluate daily AF burden. AF burden was defined as the amount of time per day a patient experienced AF, as measured by an implanted device. A prespecified time-to-first event analysis was conducted using a total AF burden of at least 6 hours per day to define an event of AF recurrence. In this analysis, hazard ratios of 0.75 (0.43, 1.32) and 0.49 (0.24, 1.04) were observed in the overall (n=69) and U.S. patient (n=42) cohorts, respectively.
 Gencaro was generally safe and well-tolerated, with 84% of patients attaining their target dose compared to 72% of patients receiving TOPROL-XL. The most frequently reported adverse events were similar in both groups and consistent with the known safety profile of the beta-blocker class of drugs. Adverse events assessed as related to study drug by the investigator occurred in 23.8% of patients in the Gencaro group and in 30.1% of patients in the TOPROL-XL group. Of note, adverse events of bradycardia were less frequently reported in the Gencaro group (3.7%) compared to patients receiving TOPROL-XL (12.0%). During the 24-week efficacy follow-up period there were three deaths (ACM) in the TOPROL-XL group and none in the Gencaro group. Three patients died in the long-term treatment extension period after receiving Gencaro for more than a year. 
 Our current development of Gencaro is, in part, based on a prospectively designed DNA substudy of adrenergic receptor polymorphisms in the BEST trial, a previous Phase 3 study of 2,708 HF patients.  Based on data from the BEST trial, Gencaro showed potential evidence of enhanced efficacy in treating AF and in reducing mortality and hospitalizations in HF patients with the beta‑1 389 arginine homozygous genotype.  In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, designated the investigation of Gencaro for the prevention of AF in a genetically targeted heart failure population (HF patients with reduced LVEF) as a Fast Track development program.
 AF, the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is a potentially serious disorder in which the normally regular and coordinated contraction pattern of the heart’s two small upper chambers, or the atria, becomes irregular, rapid and uncoordinated.  AF commonly occurs together with HFrEF, with AF being both a cause and a result of HFrEF.  By increasing heart rate and producing irregular cycle lengths, AF may contribute to the disease processes that leads to the progression of HFrEF and worsening clinical outcomes. 
 AF is considered an epidemic cardiovascular disease and a major public health burden.  The estimated number of individuals with AF globally in 2015 was 33.3 million. According to the 2017 American Heart Association report on Cardiovascular Disease, approximately 5.2 million people in the United States had atrial fibrillation in 2015.  Hospitalization rates for AF increased by 23% among U.S. adults from 2000 to 2010 and hospitalizations account for the majority of the economic cost burden associated with AF.    In a global registry of AF patients, the rates of heart failure (of all types) ranged from 33% in patients with paroxysmal (episodes lasting 7 days or less) to 56% in patients with permanent AF.  
 We believe there is a significant need for drug therapies that are safe and effective for HFrEF patients with AF or at risk of developing it, as the existing drug therapies for the treatment or prevention AF have certain safety disadvantages in HFrEF patients, such as toxic or cardiovascular adverse effects.  Most of the approved drugs for AF are contra indicated or have warnings in their prescribing information for such patients. Consequently, in the treatment and prevention of AF in HFrEF patients, we believe there is an unmet medical need for new treatments that have fewer side effects and are more effective than currently available therapies. 
 2

We believe that data from the BEST trial indicate that Gencaro may have a genetically regulated effect in reducing or preventing AF in HFrEF patients.  A retrospective analysis of data from the BEST trial shows that all patients in the trial treated with Gencaro had a 41% reduction in the risk of new onset AF (time-to-event) compared to placebo (p = 0.0004).  In a substudy in the trial, which considered only patients with the genotype believed to enhance Gencaro’s efficacy (known as the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype), patients treated with Gencaro experienced a 74% (p = 0.0003) reduction in risk of AF, based on the same analysis.  In addition, the BEST study, the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype Gencaro demonstrated enhanced efficacy in reducing mortality, hospitalizations, and ventricular tachycardia /ventricular fibrillation, or VT/VF.  Furthermore, patients with a beta‑1 389 arginine homozygous genotype who entered the trial in AF had statistically significant reductions in major cardiovascular or HF mortality/hospitalization composite endpoints, which we believe is the first and thus far only demonstration of effectiveness of a beta-blocker in reducing major HF events in HFrEF patients with permanent AF.  The beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype was present in about 50% of the patients screened and all enrolled patients in the GENETIC-AF trial and 47% of the patients in the BEST pharmacogenetic substudy, and we estimate it is present in about 50% of the North American and European general populations.
 
GENETIC-AF was completed as a Phase 2B, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, clinical superiority trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Gencaro against an active comparator, the beta-blocker TOPROL-XL (metoprolol succinate), that enrolled 267 patients. Eligible patients had HFrEF, a history of paroxysmal AF (episodes lasting 7 days or less) or persistent AF (episodes lasting more than 7 days and less than 1 year) in the past 6 months, and the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype that we believe responds most favorably to Gencaro.  We believe that Gencaro may be potentially unique in the beta-blocker class of drugs due to its apparent pharmacologic interaction with the beta-1 adrenergic receptor polymorphism.  We received guidance from the FDA regarding the GENETIC-AF clinical trial prior to initiation of the trial. The trial enrolled patients in the United States, Canada and Europe and completed enrollment in August 2017.   
 
In August 2017, the GENETIC-AF Data and Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, conducted a pre-specified interim analysis of unblinded efficacy and recommended completing the Phase 2B trial with no changes to the trial design.  All 267 patients completed their last study visits and were transitioned off study drug by the end of December 2017.  
 Our GENETIC-AF clinical trial of Gencaro required a companion diagnostic test to identify the patient’s receptor genotype.  Laboratory Corporation of America, or LabCorp, provided the companion diagnostic test and services to support our GENETIC-AF trial.  LabCorp has developed the genetic test and obtained an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, from the FDA for the companion diagnostic test used in our GENETIC‑AF clinical trial.  We retain all rights to the genetic test. Future clinical trials of Gencaro, if any, may use a similar diagnostic test to identify the patient’s receptor genotype. 
 Medtronic, Inc., or Medtronic, a global healthcare solutions company, collaborated with us on the GENETIC-AF trial in supporting our AF burden substudy. The collaboration was administered by a joint ARCA-Medtronic committee. Medtronic used its proprietary CareLink System to collect and analyze the cardiac rhythm data from the implanted Medtronic devices. The AF burden data was used by the DSMB as part of the interim analysis. 
 We have been granted patents in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions for methods of treating AF and HF patients with Gencaro based on genetic testing.  We believe our patent portfolio and new chemical entity exclusivity may provide market exclusivity for the indications of Gencaro that we may develop, into approximately 2030 or 2031 in the United States, Europe and other markets.  
  Our GENETIC-AF Phase 2B trial was completed in February 2018 and we believe our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which includes $3.4 million of net proceeds raised in January 2018 from sales of our common stock, will be sufficient to fund our operations, at our projected cost structure, through the end of 2018.  However, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than we currently anticipate.  
 In January 2017, we entered into a sales agreement with an agent to sell, from time to time, our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $7.3 million, in an “at the market offering.”  In August 2017, we amended the sales agreement to increase the maximum aggregate value of shares which we may issue and sell from time to time under this sales agreement by approximately $2.9 million, from $7.3 million to $10.2 million.  As of January 19, 2018, we have sold an aggregate of 4,811,353 shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of such sales agreement, as amended, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $10.1 million. Net proceeds received in the period were approximately $9.5 million, after deducting initial expenses for executing the “at the market offering” and commissions paid to the placement agent.  We have sold all shares available under the current prospectus.

Our Strategy 
 Our mission is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company developing cardiovascular therapies, using genetic targeting, where possible, to enhance therapeutic response. To achieve this goal, we are pursuing the following strategies: 

• | Advance the development of Gencaro. We may advance the clinical development of Gencaro for HFrEF patients with AF or at risk of developing it. However, future Gencaro development is dependent upon further analysis of our GENETIC-AF trial results, the outcome of our requested meeting with the FDA, and our ability to finance additional development through strategic partnerships or raising capital. Additional development opportunities for Gencaro potentially include indication expansion or new formulation development. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Raise additional funding or complete a strategic transaction. To support our continued operations, we expect to seek additional funding through the completion of a strategic transaction, the sale of public or private equity or debt securities, or a combination thereof.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance the development of AB171. We plan to initiate IND-enabling development activities with AB171, a thiol-substituted isosorbide mononitrate, as a potential genetically-targeted treatment for peripheral arterial disease, or PAD, and for HF.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build a cardiovascular pipeline. Our management and employees, including our chief executive officer, are experienced in cardiovascular research, molecular genetics and clinical development of cardiovascular therapies. We are seeking to leverage this expertise to identify, acquire and develop other cardiovascular products or candidates, particularly those with potential for pharmacogenetic based development, such as AB171.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our strategies are dependent upon our ability to obtain additional funding through the completion of a strategic transaction, the sale of public or private equity or debt securities, or a combination thereof.  Additionally, we are requesting a meeting with the FDA for the second quarter of 2018 to review GENETIC-AF Phase 2 data and to discuss potential future development plans for Gencaro; however, this meeting, if and when it occurs, may not leave us with an economical path forward to continue Gencaro development. 
 Atrial Fibrillation in Heart Failure Market Background and Opportunity
AF is a common and potentially serious cardiac rhythm disorder.  In AF, the normally regular and coordinated contraction pattern of the heart’s two small upper chambers, or the atria, becomes irregular, rapid and uncoordinated.  AF may produce uncomfortable symptoms, but can also have serious consequences. In addition to being a risk factor for stroke, AF can impair heart function by various mechanisms and lead to reduced cardiac function and progression of HF. 
 AF is considered an epidemic cardiovascular disease. According to the 2017 American Heart Association report on Cardiovascular Disease, approximately 5.2 million people in the United States had AF in 2015, with medical and indirect costs totaling an estimated $31 billion.  Hospitalization rates for AF increased by 23% among U.S. adults from 2000 to 2010 and hospitalizations account for the majority of the economic cost burden associated with AF.  The approved therapies for the treatment or prevention AF have certain safety disadvantages in HFrEF patients, such as toxic or cardiovascular adverse effects, and most of the approved drugs for AF are contra indicated or have warnings in their prescribing information for such patients. We believe there is an unmet medical need for new AF treatments that have fewer side effects than currently available therapies and are more effective, particularly in HFrEF patients. 
 AF often occurs in patients with HF.  HF is also one of the most prevalent and serious cardiac disorders.  In HF, cardiac function and circulatory output become impaired and cannot meet the body's metabolic demands under normal conditions.  A common type of HF is HFrEF, where left ventricular systolic function is reduced and the chamber becomes enlarged. The prevalence of AF in patients with HFrEF can vary from approximately 5% to over 50%, depending on HF severity and other factors.  In an analysis of patients with new onset HF (of all types) in the Framingham Heart Study, 57% also had AF.  In a survey of over 10,000 AF patients from 26 countries conducted in 2009 and 2010, the incidence of HF (of all types) ranged from approximately 33% to over 55%, depending on whether the patient’s AF was paroxysmal, persistent or permanent.  Therefore, there is a significant population of patients with both HF and AF, as well as HF patients at risk of developing AF.
 AF and HFrEF are interrelated and share common disease processes.  The presence of HFrEF makes it more likely AF will develop or perpetuate once it is initiated; in turn, AF in patients with HFrEF may predispose to HF progression including worsening of left ventricular dysfunction, increased hospitalization burden, and increased risk of death.  
 In treating AF, the risk of stroke is generally addressed through the use of anticoagulants. Beyond this, the goals of current medical therapy for AF are to maintain sinus rhythm or to control ventricular rate response in patients who cannot maintain sinus rhythm, in an effort to minimize patient symptoms and avoid the risk of further complications and disease progression. Current treatments include pharmaceutical therapy and procedural interventions, such as AF radiofrequency ablation or atrio-ventricular nodal ablation with pacemaker implantation. 
 Addressing the rhythm and rate abnormalities of AF is believed to be particularly important in HFrEF patients because of the relationship between the presence of AF and HF progression.  However, the current treatment options for controlling AF in these 
 4

patients have significant limitations.  While anticoagulants are commonly prescribed to address the risk of stroke in AF patients, these drugs do not address the pathological effects of the irregular and rapid heartbeat that is the hallmark of AF.  The drugs that are commonly used to control the rhythm disorder of AF, known as anti-arrhythmic drugs, have severe limitations in HFrEF patients.  These drugs may have toxic or cardiovascular adverse effects, particularly with chronic use, and most are contraindicated or have warnings in their labels for use in HF patients.
 Drugs in the class known as beta-blockers are commonly prescribed for treating HFrEF and to control rapid heart rate in HF patients with AF.  Beta-blockers are generally safe for chronic use in these patients.  However, the beta-blockers currently approved or used in HF patients are not approved for treating AF and have demonstrated mild efficacy in preventing AF.  In addition, analyses of published trials indicate that current beta-blockers provide no significant benefit in improving clinical outcomes for patients with both AF and HFrEF.
 We believe there is an unmet medical need for new therapeutics that may provide better treatment for patients with HFrEF and AF, which can safely treat the rhythm and rate disorders in these patients with greater efficacy, while improving their clinical outcomes and prognoses.
 Gencaro 
 Gencaro (bucindolol hydrochloride) is an investigational, pharmacologically unique beta-blocker and mild vasodilator being developed for the treatment of AF. Gencaro is considered part of the beta-blocker class of compounds because of its property of blocking both beta-1 and beta-2, receptors in the heart. The blocking of these receptors prevents them from binding with other molecules, primarily the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, or NE, which activate these receptors. We believe that Gencaro is well-tolerated in cardiovascular patients because of its mild vasodilator effects. Originally developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in Gencaro, bucindolol hydrochloride, has been tested clinically in approximately 4,500 patients, including over 3,000 patients in seven clinical trials in HFrEF patients. Gencaro was the subject of a Phase 3 HF mortality trial in 2,708 patients, mostly in the United States, or the BEST trial. The BEST trial included a DNA bank of over 1,000 patients, which was used to evaluate the effect of genetic variation on patients’ response to Gencaro. 
 At the time of the BEST trial, our scientific co-founders, Dr. Michael Bristow and Dr. Stephen Liggett, hypothesized that the unique pharmacologic properties of Gencaro would interact with common genetic variations of beta-1, beta-2 and alpha-2C, adrenergic receptors, which are important receptors that regulate cardiac or adrenergic (sympathetic) nerve function. They tested this hypothesis prospectively in a substudy conducted using data from the BEST DNA bank. On the basis of this study, Drs. Bristow and Liggett have determined that patients with certain variations in these receptors had substantially improved outcomes on primary and certain secondary clinical endpoints in the trial, such as mortality, HF progression, hospitalization and prevention of arrhythmias, relative to the counterpart genotype groups and the general patient population of the BEST trial. We believe that these genetically determined receptor variations, which are detectable using standard DNA testing technology, can serve as diagnostic markers for predicting enhanced therapeutic response to Gencaro, and potentially avoiding adverse events, in individual patients. We have patented our methods for treating AF and HF patients with Gencaro in the United States, Europe and other markets based on genetic testing. 
 Pharmacology and Pharmacogenetics 
 Gencaro’s pharmacology appears to be different from other compounds in the beta-blocker class in several fundamental respects. First, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, or NHLBI, and the Cooperative Studies Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs sponsored studies, or the Liggett-Bristow investigations, conducted by Drs. Bristow and Liggett indicated that in human myocardial preparations, Gencaro, but not other tested beta-blockers used to treat HF, predisposes to a shift in equilibrium of beta-1 389 arginine but not 389 glycine receptors from a constitutively active to an inactive state, a property known as inverse agonism.  Second, other studies, including BEST, indicated that Gencaro lowers the systemic levels of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, or NE, released by cardiac and other adrenergic nerves.  The beta-1 389 arginine receptor, 100% of the receptor population in patients with a 389 arginine homozygous genotype, has much higher affinity for binding to NE compared to 389 glycine receptors, and published data indicate that NE lowering from Gencaro is beneficial in patients who have only beta-1 389 arginine receptors.  In contrast, patients with lower NE affinity beta-1 389 glycine genotypes may have blunting of efficacy from greater amounts of NE lowering.  Third, Drs. Liggett and Bristow's investigations have revealed that NE lowering by Gencaro is in turn regulated by an adrenergic receptor polymorphism present in adrenergic nerve terminals, alpha-2C 322-325 insertion (Ins)/deletion (Del). The presence of 322-325 Del genotypes predisposes to greater amounts of Gencaro related NE lowering, which in the presence of beta-1 389 glycine genotypes can lead to compromise of efficacy.  However, for patients with a beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype the high affinity of this receptor for NE means that any amount of NE lowering may be beneficial, and that it is not necessary to take the alpha-2C 322-325 Ins/ Del genotype into consideration.  As a result, the GENETIC-AF trial was targeted at patients with a beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype, which was present in approximately 50% of screened patients.  We believe that these properties and their pharmacogenetic implications for modulating effectiveness are unique to Gencaro, and if the drug is approved, will be described in in the prescribing information. 
 5

Gencaro has an important interaction with the beta-1 receptor found on muscle cells, or cardiac myocytes, of the heart. The general role of the beta-1 receptor and its downstream signaling cascades is to regulate the strength and rate of the heart’s contractions. NE serves as an activator of the beta-1 receptor, causing the receptor to initiate signaling to the cardiac myocyte. Although this signaling may be beneficial to the failing heart in the short term, in chronic HFrEF patients the beta-1 receptor also initiates harmful, or cardiomyopathic, signaling which, over time, exacerbates the heart’s structural and functional decline. Beta-blockers counteract this destructive process by reducing beta-1 receptor signaling and reversing abnormal patterns of gene expression.  They do this by binding to the receptor and blocking NE molecules from binding and activating the signaling activity and, in Gencaro’s case, by inactivating  constitutively active (i.e. active in the absence of NE stimulation) beta-1 389 arginine receptors and lowering NE levels. 
 We believe Gencaro has a powerful interaction with the higher-function beta-1 389 arginine variation of the beta-1 receptor. Laboratory studies show that constitutively active receptors will continue to signal in the presence of standard beta-blockade with neutral antagonists. The Liggett-Bristow investigations have demonstrated that in isolated preparations of human ventricular myocardium, in beta-1 389 arginine receptors carvedilol and metoprolol are neutral antagonists, and that metoprolol can block the inverse agonist effects of Gencaro that reduce the signaling of constitutively active receptors. We believe that Gencaro's inverse agonist property contributes to the enhanced lowering of heart failure and arrhythmia event rates in HFrEF patients who are beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype relative to individuals who are beta-1 389 Gly carriers or to the general population. In addition, we believe the unique NE lowering properties of Gencaro have a selectively beneficial effect in patients who have only beta-1 389 arginine receptors, because of the high affinity of these receptors for NE. 
 The BEST trial 
 The NHLBI and Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies funded BEST trial began in 1995. It was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study of bucindolol’s effect on reduction of mortality and morbidity in an advanced chronic HFrEF population. The primary endpoint of the BEST trial was all cause mortality, or ACM, and the pre-specified main secondary endpoint was progression of HF, defined as death from HF, cardiac transplant, HF hospitalization, or emergency room visit for the treatment of worsening HF not requiring hospitalization. The trial was planned to run four and one-half years, and enroll 2,800 patients. The trial enrolled a total of 2,708 chronic HF patients, who were mostly from the United States. Under the umbrella of the BEST trial substudies program, a DNA bank and substudy was created, and 1,040 of the BEST patients participated by providing blood for DNA analysis. The DNA bank provided data for the DNA substudy of BEST patients conducted by Drs. Bristow and Liggett. 
 In 1999, the BEST trial was terminated prior to the completion of follow-up, in response to a recommendation of the BEST trial DSMB. The primary reason for termination was loss of investigator equipoise; in other words, the fact that the BEST investigators were no longer uncertain regarding the comparative therapeutic merits of giving a placebo versus giving a beta-blocker to a HFrEF patient. Positive mortality results from two other HF trials involving other beta-blockers had been reported, and a substantial number of BEST trial investigators concluded that it was unethical to continue to give placebo to BEST trial participants. As a result, some investigators began to prescribe these other beta-blockers to patients in the trial, which threatened to destroy the trial’s integrity; therefore the trial was terminated early. 
 Clinical Results and the DNA Substudy 
 Following termination, the preliminary results of the study were analyzed and published. The preliminary determination and general perception were that the BEST trial had failed on the basis of not meeting its primary endpoint of ACM. The published values were a 10% risk reduction in mortality with a p-value of 0.10. Subsequently, we reanalyzed the results from BEST, in accordance with the FDA approved, pre-specified statistical analysis plans, which had not been performed by the sponsors of BEST when the trial was terminated. Our reanalysis demonstrated a 13% risk reduction on the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality in the BEST trial with a p-value of 0.053. 
 In 2003 and 2004, the results of the DNA substudy conducted by Drs. Bristow and Liggett began to be analyzed and released. The DNA substudy results indicated a significant enhancement of response on the major heart failure clinical endpoints from the BEST trial in patients with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype. The risk reduction on HF clinical efficacy endpoints such as mortality and hospitalization ranged from 34% to 48% in this genotype. In addition, in arrhythmia endpoints of atrial fibrillation or VT/VF, tracked by adverse events, or AEs, and surveillance electrocardiograms, or ECGs, the risk reduction by bucindolol in the beta‑1 389 arginine homozygous genotype appeared to be even greater, with risk reductions of 74% for both endpoints.

 Analysis of BEST trial for AF 
 The BEST study data were further analyzed focusing on AF prevention, rate control in patients with established AF, and on clinical outcomes of patients with AF. Although there was no pre-determined AF endpoint, including reduction in risk of AF, in the BEST trial, according to our analysis of adverse events and surveillance ECG’s during the trial, 7.9% of patients developed new onset AF, with a greater incidence observed in the placebo group (9.7%) compared to the bucindolol group (6.2%). This corresponded to a 36% reduction in the incidence of new onset AF (based on crude event rates) for patients receiving bucindolol (p = 0.002). In a time to event analysis, the risk of new onset AF was reduced by 41% (p = 0.0004) with bucindolol treatment. Patients in the BEST study with the beta-1 389 Arg/Arg genotype who received Gencaro had a 74% reduction in the risk of developing new onset AF (p = 0.0003). 
 Further published analyses of the data from BEST suggest that Gencaro may also have potential efficacy for other clinical endpoints and outcomes related to AF. A published analysis of the BEST data revealed that of the 303 patients in the BEST trial with established AF, 67% of those who received Gencaro achieved ventricular response rate control, defined as a resting heart rate of less than or equal to 80 beats per minute without symptomatic bradycardia (p < 0.005). In AF patients who achieved ventricular response rate control, Gencaro produced a 39% reduction (p = 0.025) in cardiovascular mortality/cardiovascular hospitalizations. In addition, Gencaro also improved cardiovascular clinical endpoints for those AF patients possessing the beta-1 389 arginine genotype that ARCA believes is most favorable for Gencaro response. In a substudy of 1,040 patients in BEST in which patient genotypes were analyzed, Gencaro was associated with a 72% decrease (p = 0.039) in cardiovascular mortality/cardiovascular hospitalizations in those 52 AF patients in the substudy with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype. 
 Analysis of the BEST Study data also shows that Gencaro has potential efficacy against the serious arrhythmias of VT/VF, which also appears to be genetically regulated. A published report demonstrated that patients in the BEST Trial who received Gencaro experienced a 58% reduction in the incidence of VT/VF (p = 0.00006), adjusted for the competing risk of mortality. In addition, the authors of this report determined that Gencaro reduced the incidence of VT/VF by 74% (p = 0.00005) in patients with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype. 
 As with the overall study cohort, most patients (89%) in the 1,040 patient DNA substudy were free of AF (91% sinus rhythm, 9% other non-AF rhythms) at baseline. The proportion of patients free of AF at baseline was also similar in the two treatment groups for the overall DNA substudy cohort, as well as in the beta-1 389 genotype subgroups. In the BEST DNA substudy, the proportion of patients who developed new onset AF was similar compared to the overall study cohort for both the placebo group (11% and 10%, respectively) and the Gencaro group in the DNA substudy population compared to the overall study cohort (7% and 6%, respectively). Also, there was a similar reduction in new onset AF observed in the bucindolol group compared to placebo (43% and 41%, respectively, by time to event analysis). Therefore, the overall results from the genetic substudy population are consistent with the results from the overall study population. 
 7

In patients with all genotypes, the AF risk reduction of 41-43% by Gencaro in BEST is based on an analysis of adverse events and surveillance ECG’s which was similar to AF risk reductions observed in a meta-analysis of data regarding seven placebo-controlled beta-blocker trials in HFrEF patients. In the meta-analysis, beta-blockers appeared to reduce the incidence of new onset AF in all but one trial, with an overall relative risk reduction of 27%. Despite what we believe to be potential evidence for the prevention of AF in HFrEF trials, no beta-blocker has FDA approval for use in this indication. However, the evidence of modest efficacy by beta-blockers approved for other indications will require that any Phase 3 trials with Gencaro will have an active beta-blocker comparator instead of a comparison against placebo. The Phase 2B trial GENETIC-AF trial only enrolled patients with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype. In the BEST trial, the post hoc analysis of patients with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype who received Gencaro had a 74% reduction in the risk of developing AF.  
 Clinical and Regulatory Strategy
 The regulatory strategy for Gencaro is to obtain an AF approval in a genotype specific HFrEF population. We enrolled certain patients with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype in our AF clinical trial, GENETIC-AF, because our analysis of the BEST DNA substudy indicated this group had a 74% reduction in risk for new AF events, in addition to reducing event rates for mortality and HF hospitalizations. 
 
In February 2018, we reported the top-line results of our GENETIC-AF clinical trial of Gencaro.  The primary analysis was conducted for evidence of safety and detection of superior efficacy of Gencaro versus the active comparator, TOPROL-XL.  Overall, Gencaro demonstrated a similar treatment benefit compared to the active comparator, TOPROL-XL.  In U.S. patients (127 of 267 total patients), a trend for potential superior benefit in favor of Gencaro (approximately 30% risk reduction over TOPROL-XL), was observed for the primary endpoint of time to recurrence of AF. Additionally, in U.S. patients, Gencaro demonstrated a trend for potential superior benefit in favor of Gencaro (approximately 51% risk reduction over TOPROL-XL) in a subset of patients who underwent continuous heart rhythm monitoring with Medtronic implanted devices. Safety data indicated that Gencaro was generally safe and well-tolerated in the AF/HF population investigated with a safety profile similar to TOPROL-XL. 
 
We are requesting a meeting with the FDA for the second quarter of 2018 to review GENETIC-AF Phase 2 data and to discuss potential future development plans for Gencaro.
 In 2015, the FDA designated the investigation of Gencaro for the prevention of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter in a genetically targeted heart failure population (heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction) as a Fast Track development program.  
 Fast Track drug development designation was included in the FDA Modernization Act of 1997, or FDAMA, as a formal process to enhance interactions with the FDA during drug development. A drug development program with Fast Track designation is eligible for consideration for some or all of the following programs for expediting development and review: scheduled meetings to seek FDA input into development plans, priority review of the NDA the option of submitting portions of an NDA for review prior to submission of the complete application and potential accelerated approval.
 The Gencaro Test 
 If approved, we believe that Gencaro will be the first cardiovascular drug to be integrated with a companion diagnostic to predict enhanced efficacy. We believe the drug label we will propose for Gencaro would identify the patient receptor genotype studied in the trial that can expect enhanced efficacy and, and that the label would recommend receptor genotype testing prior to initiation of therapy.  Therefore, the commercialization of Gencaro may require an FDA approved diagnostic test for this genotype be available.  Such a test, or the Gencaro Test, could be performed by a variety of laboratory processes or platforms.  We used one such platform for the GENETIC-AF trial, and retain all rights to it.  We believe the Genaro Test could be developed and commercialized through a preferred diagnostic provider, by the company marketing Gencaro, or a combination of approaches.  We also believe that point of care genetic tests, which could be performed during the patient’s visit to the physician, may be feasible as part of the commercialization strategy.
 For our GENETIC-AF clinical trial, we had an agreement with LabCorp to provide the companion diagnostic test and services to support the trial.  To provide those services, LabCorp developed the genetic test and obtained from the FDA an IDE for the companion diagnostic test that we used in our GENETIC-AF clinical trial. 
 Licensing and Royalty Obligations 
 We have licensed worldwide rights to all preclinical and clinical data
 from development of bucindolol through the BEST trial from Cardiovascular Pharmacology and Engineering Consultants, LLC, or CPEC, who has licensed rights to this data from BMS. In addition, we have sublicensed CPEC’s rights from BMS. CPEC is a licensing entity which holds the rights of the biotechnology companies that were the commercial sponsors of the BEST trial. If the FDA grants marketing approval for Gencaro, the license 
 8

agreements state that we are required to make a milestone payment of $8.0 million within six months after FDA approval. The license agreements also state that we are required to make milestone payments of up to $5.0 million in the aggregate upon regulatory marketing approval in Europe and Japan. The licenses state that our royalty obligations range from 12.5% to 25% of revenue from the related product based on achievement of specified product sales levels including a 5% royalty that CPEC is obligated to pay BMS. The agreements state that we have the right to buy down the royalties to a range of 12.5% to 17% by making a payment to CPEC within six months of regulatory approval.  In October 2017, we entered into an agreement with CPEC’s minority owner, Aeolus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Aeolus, pursuant to which we acquired Aeolus’ minority membership interest in CPEC.  The transaction effectively buys-out Aeolus’ royalty interest thereby reducing or eliminating the stated milestone and royalty obligations by 35% that could be payable by us, if Gencaro receives regulatory approval and is commercialized.  In the transaction, we also acquired all of CPEC’s rights to milestones and royalties for Europe and certain other territories outside of the United States.
 We also have licensed worldwide rights to intellectual property covering the pharmacogenetic response of Gencaro based on the cardiac receptor polymorphisms, which is owned by the University of Colorado. We have no material future financial obligations under this license.  We also have licensed exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize diagnostics for these receptor polymorphisms, for the purpose of prescribing Gencaro. 
 Development Pipeline 
 Our development activities are substantially focused on our lead product candidate, Gencaro, for the potential treatment of HF patients with AF. The primary endpoint of the GENETIC-AF trial was the prevention of AF in these patients.  We also believe, based upon data from the BEST trial, that Gencaro may have additional potential in providing rate control and clinical benefit for patients with permanent AF, in preventing VT/VF and in treating HF generally. We also have developed and patented an isomer version of bucindolol, which appears to be substantially more potent than the current formulation.  We do not expect to pursue development of Gencaro for disease indications beyond HFrEF patients with AF without obtaining additional funding or entering into a strategic partnership or collaboration. We believe Gencaro has potential to address these additional indications, and that the clinical response of patients with these diseases may be genetically influenced, based on the same genetic markers we have identified for our proposed treatment of AF with Gencaro. 
 AB171 is a thiol-containing derivative of isosorbide mononitrate.  Pre-clinical data indicate that AB171 may have anti-oxidant properties and may be favorably differentiated from other nitrates for prevention of myocardial remodeling, anti-atherosclerotic effects and the development of tolerance. We believe the unique pharmacology of AB171, coupled with targeting to genetically-identified enhanced response subpopulations, has the potential to translate to better long-term responses than treatment with traditional pharmacotherapy. We have discovered what we believe to be a pharmacogenetic target for AB171 that is the basis for our patents and which we believe may enable genetically-targeted cardiovascular development programs.  In November 2017, we announced our intent to develop the compound based on our genetic use patent approach. We plan to advance development of AB171, a potential New Chemical Entity, or NCE, for the treatment of two cardiovascular indications: peripheral arterial disease, or PAD, and chronic HF.  The European Patent Office has issued to us a patent on methods of treating cardiovascular disease and conditions with a thiol-substituted isosorbide mononitrate based on genetic targeting.  The European patent has been validated in ten countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.  ARCA has related patent applications pending in the United States Patent Office and Canadian Intellectual Property Office. 
 We are currently designing the preclinical development plan for AB171 and intend to initiate chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, activities in the second quarter of 2018, followed by nonclinical studies with AB171 to support future submission of an IND application. 
 We also have exclusive pharmacogenetic and other patent rights to drug candidates that have potential indications in cardiovascular disease, oncology and other therapeutic areas. We may seek partners to assist us in the development of these candidates or who may license them. We may also seek funds to advance the development of the compounds on our own.  
 Competition 
 Current AF treatments include pharmaceutical, procedural or device intervention. There are several antiarrhythmic drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment and/or prevention of recurrent AF. However, these drugs have safety and/or administration concerns and all but one have contraindications or label warnings regarding their prescription in patients with heart failure. 
 Drugs that are currently approved or used for the treatment or prevention of AF in HFrEF have notable risks due to adverse side effects or lack sufficient efficacy.  Therefore, in HFrEF we believe there is a substantial unmet medical need for new AF treatments that have fewer side effects and are more effective than currently available therapies. We believe that Gencaro’s prevention of AF in HFrEF patients would provide this patient population a safer treatment option than other treatments currently or approved by FDA.

The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. We face significant competition from pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies that are researching and selling products designed to treat cardiovascular conditions. Most of these companies have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing, and commercial resources than we have. 
 In addition, our proposed prescribing information for Gencaro includes a recommendation for genetic testing, which will add additional cost and procedures to the process of prescribing Gencaro, and which could make it more difficult for us to compete against existing or future therapies. 
 Manufacturing and Product Supply 
 Gencaro is a small molecule drug with an established manufacturing history. Multiple manufacturers of both the API and drug product have successfully produced Gencaro for use in clinical trials over the course of its clinical development. We outsource all manufacturing and analytical testing of the Gencaro API and drug product. We have selected third party contract manufacturing organizations on the basis of their technical and regulatory expertise. Our approach with our contract manufacturing partners has been to replicate the manufacturing processes that were used to support the prior pivotal clinical trial with Gencaro, and to minimize any changes from these baseline processes, thereby reducing technical and regulatory risk. We contracted with Groupe Novasep to complete the drug substance registration batches required for the Gencaro NDA. These batches were successful, and the resulting drug substance was used to supply the drug product registration campaign. Remaining inventory was placed in current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, storage to provide a backup supply for the GENETIC-AF trial, and for use as an initial source of drug substance to support eventual product launch, if approved. 
 For drug product production, we have contracted with Patheon, Inc. to manufacture the Gencaro tablets. Gencaro is produced in a tablet form, utilizing standard solid oral dosage processing techniques. Six separate dosage strengths are manufactured, with the maximum recommended dose of 50mg twice daily for patients weighing 75kg or less and 100mg twice daily for patients weighing more than 75kg. Registration batches were successfully completed by Patheon, Inc. and tablets from these runs were placed in cGMP storage to supply the GENETIC-AF trial. In addition, we contracted with a separate service provider for packaging and distribution of our clinical trial materials.  
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Our research and development expenses were $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $12.3 million for 2016, an increase of approximately $1.7 million. R&D expense in 2018 is expected to be lower than 2017, as we have completed our GENETIC-AF clinical trial. 
Government Regulation 
 Governmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state, and local levels and foreign countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, marketing, distribution, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical and medical device products. In the United States, the FDA regulates these activities at the federal level pursuant to the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In Canada, Health Canada regulates these activities.  In Europe, the Competent Authorities and Ethics Committees of the respective countries regulate these activities.  We anticipate that all of our product candidates will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. The process of obtaining approval and the subsequent process of maintaining compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. In addition, these statutes, rules, regulations and policies may change and our products may be subject to new legislation or regulations.  Both before and after approval or clearance, failure to comply with the requirements of the FDA and other state and federal statutes can lead to significant penalties or could disrupt our ability to manufacture and sell these products. In addition, the FDA could refuse to provide certificates needed to export our products if the agency determines that we are not in compliance. 
Premarket Approval of Drugs 
 FDA approval is required for marketing of any new drug, dosage form, indication, or strength. The steps required before new human therapeutic drug products are marketed in the United States and foreign countries include rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval requirements by regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries. There is no guarantee that products will be approved in a specific timeframe or at all. 
 Preclinical Phase. Preclinical studies are generally conducted in the laboratory to identify potential drug candidates and to evaluate their potential efficacy and safety. These studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate short and long-term toxicity in animals. Preclinical studies are governed by numerous regulations, including but not limited to FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices. 
 10

Clinical Phase. Before human clinical trials can commence, an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, submitted to FDA must become effective. For an IND to become effective, the applicant must submit, among other things, information on design of the proposed investigation, reports necessary to assess the safety of the drug for use in clinical investigation, and information on the chemistry and manufacturing of the drug, controls available for the drug, and primary data tabulations from animal or human studies. The clinical phase of development involves the performance of human studies, including adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication. Typically, clinical evaluation involves three sequential phases, which may overlap. During Phase 1, clinical trials are conducted with a relatively small number of subjects or patients to determine the early safety profile of a product candidate, as well as dose tolerance, absorption, and the pattern of drug distribution and drug metabolism. Phase 2 trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted by a specific target disease to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosage tolerance and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. In Phase 3, larger-scale, multi- center trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a specific target disease over a longer term to confirm Phase 2 results and provide reliable and conclusive data supporting efficacy and safety of a drug as required by regulatory agencies for drug approval. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation. FDA may delay or suspend clinical trials through clinical holds. 
 NDA Submission. In the United States, the results of preclinical and clinical testing along with chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA. Under the current Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, after submission of an NDA and payment, or waiver, of the required fee, the FDA’s goal is to review most standard NDAs within 10 months from the time that a sponsor’s application is accepted as filed by the FDA, which can occur within a 60-day window following the initial submission of the application. At the end of the 10 months, the FDA’s goal is to issue a “complete response,” or approve the NDA. While FDA’s goal is to issue a complete response within 10 months, the process may take longer than 10 months, particularly if multiple review cycles are required. Gencaro has been granted Fast Track Designation which allows for a rolling review of a marketing application.  A rolling review allows FDA to consider reviewing portions of a NDA before the sponsor submits the complete application.
 In responding to an NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval or deny the application if the FDA determines that the application does not satisfy the statutory and regulatory approval criteria. A denial may include a request for additional information, including additional clinical data and/or an additional Phase 3 clinical trial. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. Under the Food and Drug Modernization Act of 1997, the FDA is authorized to approve a drug based on a single adequate and well-controlled study if such study and other confirmatory data are sufficient to establish the drug’s effectiveness. However, it has long been the FDA’s general position that the standard of proof of a drug’s effectiveness generally requires at least two well-controlled and adequate Phase 3 clinical studies demonstrating statistically significant results as compared to a placebo or active control (with p-values of less than 0.05) with respect to the primary endpoint or endpoints of the trial. 
 In addition, in accordance with current FDA law and regulations, the FDA may refer a drug to an advisory committee for review prior to approval. Most new compounds are referred to an FDA advisory committee, which could add additional time to the review process. There is no guarantee that the advisory committee will recommend approval of a drug candidate. In some cases, FDA may require completion, within a specified time period, of additional clinical studies after approval, referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies, to monitor the effect of a new product and may prevent or limit future marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Furthermore, prior to granting approval, the FDA generally conducts an inspection of the facilities, including outsourced facilities that will be involved in the manufacture, production, packaging, testing and control of the drug substance and finished drug product for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements. 
 If the FDA approves the NDA, the sponsor is authorized to begin commercialization of the drug in accordance with the approval. Even if the FDA approves the NDA, the FDA may decide later to suspend or withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety problems are recognized after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA requires surveillance programs to monitor approved products that have been commercialized, and the agency has the power to require additional clinical studies, to require changes in labeling or to prevent further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. The FDA also has authority to request implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, that could restrict distribution of Gencaro or require us to provide additional risk information to prescribers. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product candidate by comparable foreign regulatory authorities is necessary prior to the commencement of marketing of a product candidate in those countries. The approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required for FDA approval. 
 Post-approval Compliance. If regulatory approval for a drug or medical device is obtained, the product and the facilities manufacturing the product are subject to periodic inspection and continued regulation by regulatory authorities, including compliance with cGMP, as well as labeling, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, including the reporting of adverse events. In addition, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for labeling, promotion to health care professionals, direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance 
 11

with the provisions of the approved labeling. Companies are responsible for compliance with such requirements and would be responsible to ensure that all contract manufacturing organizations who perform work for them also comply with such requirements. Similarly, if a drug manufacturer hires contract sales representatives or consultants to promote its products, such organizations or individuals must comply with all of the same requirements applicable to the drug manufacturer. The FDA regularly inspects companies to determine compliance with cGMPs and other post-market requirements. Failure to comply with statutory requirements and the FDA’s regulations can result in a variety of administrative or enforcement actions, including but not limited to an FDA Form 483 (which is issued by the FDA at the conclusions of an inspection when an investigator has observed any conditions that may constitute violations), a public warning letter, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, product detentions, refusal to provide export certificates, seizure of products and criminal prosecution. 
 Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress created an abbreviated FDA review process for generic versions of pioneer (brand name) drug products. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for patent term restoration and the award, in certain circumstances, of non-patent marketing exclusivities. 
 Generic Drug Approval. The Hatch-Waxman Act established an abbreviated FDA review process for drugs that are shown to be equivalent to approved pioneer drugs. Approval for a generic drug is obtained by filing an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA. Generic drug applications are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, an ANDA applicant must establish that its product is bioequivalent to an approved drug and that it is the same as the approved drug with respect to active ingredient(s), route of administration, dosage form, strength and recommended conditions of use (labeling). The FDA will approve the generic as suitable for an ANDA if it finds that the generic does not raise questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the pioneer drug. A drug is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the pioneer drug or if it is intended for a different use. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of an approved drug listed in FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or the Orange Book, must certify to the FDA  that (i) no patent information on the drug has been listed in the Orange Book; (ii) that each patent listed in the Orange Book for that approved drug has expired; (iii) FDA should approve the product on the date on which a listed patent expires; or (iv) that such patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the generic drug. If the ANDA applicant makes a certification pursuant to (iv) above, or a Paragraph IV certification, and the NDA holder files an infringement suit against the ANDA applicant within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV notification, the NDA owner is entitled to an automatic 30-month stay of FDA’s ability to approve the ANDA. This 30-month stay will end early upon any decision by a court that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by the generic drug. 
 Patent Term Extension. While the term of a U.S. patent is generally 20 years from the earliest priority date of a patent application (excluding a provisional patent application), a U.S. patent that covers subject matter requiring regulatory approval to market is eligible for an extension of that patent term. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides for the restoration of a portion of the patent term lost during product development and FDA review of an application. Patent Term Extension, or PTE, extends the term of an issued patent for generally (i) the length of the FDA approval process, i.e., the complete period of NDA review, and (ii) half of the time spent in clinical trials, i.e., the IND period. However, the maximum period of restoration cannot exceed five years, or restore the total remaining term of the patent to greater than 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the product. 
 Under 35 U.S.C. § 156(a), a patent covering a method of using a product is eligible for PTE if the following conditions are met: 
  
1) | the patent has not yet expired;
---+--------------------------------


2) | the patent was not previously extended;
---+----------------------------------------


3) | the patent owner submits an application for PTE that includes all necessary supporting information within 60 days of FDA approval;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | the product was subject to regulatory review before its commercial marketing or use; and
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5) | the drug application is for the first permitted commercial marketing of the product.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have obtained four U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 7,678,824; 8,080,578; 8,093,286; 8,946,284). We believe that, if Gencaro is approved by the FDA, any one of the U.S. patents may be eligible for PTE, which could provide approximately 5 years of additional patent life based on our current clinical trial plans. 
 A Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC, is a form of patent term extension that is available for pharmaceutical products approved for marketing in the European Union, or EU. We obtained a patent in Europe on methods for using Gencaro that is similar to US Patent 7,678,824 (EP 1802775); this EP patent is in force in certain countries in Europe, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. We believe that this patent may be eligible for an SPC, if Gencaro is approved for marketing in any European country in which the patent is in force, which could provide up to five years of additional patent life. We believe that our patents in other jurisdictions may also be eligible for similar term extensions.

Non-Patent Marketing Exclusivities. Separate and apart from patent protection, the Hatch-Waxman Act entitles approved drugs to various periods of non-patent statutory protection, known as marketing exclusivity. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five years of “new chemical entity” marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a product that contains an active moiety not found in any other approved product. This exclusivity means that another manufacturer cannot submit an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the marketing exclusivity period ends. This exclusivity protects the entire new chemical entity franchise, including all products containing the active ingredient for any use and in any strength or dosage form, but will not prevent the submission or approval of stand-alone NDAs where the applicants have conducted their own clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. There is an exception, however, for a competitor that seeks to challenge a patent with a Paragraph IV certification. Four years into the five-year exclusivity period, a manufacturer who alleges that one or more of the patents listed with the NDA is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed may submit an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for a generic or modified version of the product. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of “new use” marketing exclusivity for the approval of NDAs, and supplements, where those applications contain the results of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the FDA’s approval of the applications. Such applications may be submitted for new indications, dosage forms, strengths, or new conditions of use of approved products. So long as the studies are essential to the FDA’s approval or were conducted by or for the applicant, this three-year exclusivity prohibits the final approval of ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for products with the specific changes associated with those studies. It does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for other products containing the same active ingredient, without those changes. 
 Similar non-patent market exclusivity is provided for in the EU and other international jurisdictions.  We believe that, if approved in the EU, Gencaro may be eligible for ten years of market exclusivity in the EU, measured from the date of approval there.

 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that a company wishes to market in the United States requires either approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA, or clearance of a premarket notification, commonly known as a “510(k)” from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either class I or II, which may require the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. Clearance of a 510(k) usually requires between three months and one year from the time of submission of the 510(k), although the process may take longer. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance procedure is less rigorous than the PMA approval procedure, but is available only to companies who can establish that their device is substantially equivalent to a legally-marketed “predicate” device that was (i) on the market prior to the enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, (ii) reclassified from Class III to Class II, or (iii) has been cleared through the 510(k) procedure. 510(k)s must typically be supported by performance data, including preclinical data, bench testing, and in some cases, clinical data. Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, or for which there is no predicate, are placed in class III, and require a PMA. 
 PMA Pathway. Generally, a PMA must be supported by extensive data and valid scientific evidence, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After a PMA is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information and will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with FDA’s Quality System Regulations, or QSR. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the “accepted application”, although, generally, review of the application can take between one and three years, and it may take significantly longer. The PMA application process can be expensive, and there is a substantial “user fee” that must be paid to FDA in connection with the submission of a PMA application. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application or the manufacturing facility is not favorable, the FDA may deny approval of the PMA application or issue a “not approvable” letter. The FDA may also require additional clinical trials, which can delay the PMA approval process by several years. In addition, if FDA discovers that an applicant has submitted false or misleading information, FDA may refuse to review submissions until certain requirements are met pursuant to its Application Integrity Policy, or AIP. If the FDA approves the PMA, it may place restrictions on the device.  After the PMA is approved, if significant changes are made to a device, its manufacturing or labeling, a PMA supplement containing additional information must be filed for prior FDA approval. PMA supplements often must be approved by the FDA before the modification to the device, the labeling, or the manufacturing process may be implemented.  Delays in receipt of or failure to receive such clearances or approvals, the loss of previously received clearances or approvals, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Clinical Trials. Clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. These trials generally require an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the proposed study is deemed a non-significant risk study, which is eligible for an exemption from the IDE requirements. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results. Clinical trials may begin if the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical trial sites. Submission of an IDE application does not give assurance that the FDA will issue the IDE. If the IDE application is approved, there can be no assurance the FDA will determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness 
 13

of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to and approved by the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan in such a way that may affect its scientific soundness, study indication or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. The trial must also comply with the FDA’s regulations, including the requirement that informed consent be obtained from each subject. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance to market the product in the United States.
 In Vitro Diagnostic Companion Diagnostic Devices. FDA has described IVD companion diagnostic devices as in vitro diagnostic devices that provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. The use of an IVD companion diagnostic device with a particular therapeutic product is stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both the diagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic product, as well as in the labeling of any generic equivalents of the therapeutic product. An IVD companion diagnostic device could be used to (i) identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; (ii) identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious adverse reactions as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or (iii) monitor response to treatment for the purpose of adjusting treatment (e.g., schedule, dose, discontinuation) to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Although FDA’s regulation of IVD companion diagnostic devices is evolving and implemented on a case-by-case basis, FDA’s stated policy for a novel therapeutic product is that an IVD companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously to support the therapeutic product’s safe and effective use. The clinical performance and clinical significance of the IVD companion diagnostic device is to be established using data from the clinical development program of the corresponding therapeutic product. FDA recognizes, however, that there may be cases where contemporaneous development may not be possible. With respect to the Gencaro Test, there is no assurance that we will be able to develop and obtain approval or clearance contemporaneously with Gencaro. Failure to develop the Gencaro Test or obtain clearance or approval could delay approval of Gencaro, if FDA regards the Gencaro Test as an IVD companion diagnostic test that is essential to the safe and effective use of Gencaro. 
 Continuing Regulation. After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply to the manufacturer, or holder of a PMA approval. Unless subject to an exemption, medical devices distributed in the United States must be manufactured in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulations, or QSRs, and current good manufacturing practices. These regulations govern the manufacturing process, including design, manufacture, testing, release, packaging, distribution, documentation and purchasing, as well as complaint handling, corrective and preventative actions and internal auditing. In complying with the QSRs, manufacturers must expend significant time, money and effort. Companies are also subject to other post-market and general requirements, including but not limited to product listing and establishment registration, post-market surveillance requirements, limitations on promotion, and requirements for recordkeeping and reporting of certain adverse events, malfunctions, corrections and removals.  As discussed above, FDA regularly inspects companies to assess compliance with the QSRs and other post-market requirements.  Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, and potential civil and criminal penalties.  With respect to the Gencaro Test, we intend to seek a new or amended collaborative arrangement with a diagnostic company in which we could license them certain rights to perform the diagnostic test for patients with AF. As part of such arrangement, we will seek to have the diagnostic company take responsibility for compliance with the FDA’s device approval and on-going regulatory requirements. 
 International Marketing Approvals. International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country and are subject to change. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. 
 Other Regulatory Requirements. We are also subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our work. The extent and character of governmental regulation that might result from future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted. 
Medical Device Tax
 In March 2010, the U.S. Congress adopted and President Obama signed into law comprehensive health care reform legislation. Among other initiatives, these laws impose significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. medical device sales, with certain exemptions, beginning on January 1, 2013. On January 22, 2018, legislation was enacted suspending the medical device tax in 2018 and 2019.  It will be reinstated on January 1, 2020, unless a permanent repeal takes place before that date.  The Gencaro Test is likely to be subject to this tax if this tax is reinstated in the future.
Intellectual Property 
 The future success of our business will partly depend on our ability to maintain market exclusivity for Gencaro in the United States and important international markets, and for other products or product candidates that we may acquire or develop. We will rely on 
 14

statutory protection, patent protection, trade secrets, know-how, and in-licensing of technology rights to maintain protection for our products. 
 We believe that both patent protection and data exclusivity statutes will give Gencaro market exclusivity in the United States and in major international markets. If approved by the FDA or international regulatory agencies, Gencaro will qualify as a New Chemical Entity, or NCE, as it has never received regulatory approval in any jurisdiction. As an NCE, Gencaro will enjoy market exclusivity in the United States and most international markets under data exclusivity statutes. These laws provide for an exclusivity period beginning from regulatory approval, during which any generic competitor is barred from submitting an application that relies on the data that has been submitted in connection with the approval of the NCE. In the United States, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides for an initial period of up to five years from approval of the NCE, during which a generic application attempting to rely on the data submitted for the NCE cannot be filed with the FDA. This period can be effectively extended to seven and one-half years from FDA approval because a provision of the Hatch-Waxman Act provides for an automatic 30-month extension of the exclusivity period if we promptly pursue litigation against a company attempting to enter the market with a generic for a drug that is covered by a composition of matter or method of use patent. 
 Many international markets have data exclusivity statutes that are analogous to Hatch-Waxman and often more protective. The analogous statute in the European Medicines Evaluation Agency will, in general, provide Gencaro with a minimum of ten years of protection before such a generic application may be approved. Protection under Hatch-Waxman and other data exclusivity statutes is sometimes considered superior to patent protection, as the generic cannot be marketed during the period of exclusivity, thus eliminating the need to initiate patent infringement litigation with its accompanying risks and costs. 
 In addition to protection under data exclusivity statutes, we believe that Gencaro’s patent portfolio will also provide market exclusivity. We have been granted patents in the United States and Europe that claim the use of Gencaro in patients predicted to have a favorable response to the drug based on genetic polymorphisms in the genes encoding the beta-1 and/or alpha-2C receptors. We believe that this patent strategy may deter generic competition because of the threat of patent litigation or may exclude generic competition from the market until the patents expire if we are successful in litigation. Consequently, if our patent strategy is successful, we believe we may avoid generic competition with Gencaro in the United States or certain countries in Europe until at least the expiration of these patents, which would be no earlier than 2026 in the United States and into 2025 in Europe. In addition, we believe that if Gencaro is approved, any one of our U.S. patents may be entitled to an extension of its term and the European patent may be entitled to an extension through a supplemental protection certificate in one or more countries in Europe. The length of any such extension may vary by country. We cannot predict whether any such extensions will be granted, but if they are, they may provide market exclusivity for Gencaro into approximately 2030 or 2031 in the United States and Europe.  In addition, we were granted a patent on the S-isomer formulation of Gencaro, which we believe could be important in Gencaro’s future development. 
 For AB171, the European Patent Office issued patent (EPO # 2515899) on methods of treating cardiovascular disease and conditions with a thiol-substituted isosorbide mononitrate based on genetic targeting.  The European patent, entitled “Methods and Compositions for Cardiovascular Diseases and Conditions,” provides protection for this novel approach to treating patients with cardiovascular disease and conditions.  The European patent has been validated in ten countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.  We have related patent applications pending in the United States Patent Office and Canadian Intellectual Property Office.
 We also have other patent rights in additional drug candidates having possible indications in cardiovascular disease, oncology, and other therapeutic areas; these are in both early and later stages of development. We may seek collaborators to assist us in the development of these candidates or we may seek to raise funds to advance the development of the compounds on our own.
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 20 full-time employees.  None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees.
