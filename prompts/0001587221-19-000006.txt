Item 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Zosano Pharma Corporation is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on providing rapid systemic administration of therapeutics to patients using our proprietary Adhesive Dermally-Applied Microarray, or ADAM, technology. In February 2017, we announced positive results from our ZOTRIP pivotal efficacy trial, or ZOTRIP trial, that evaluated Qtrypta™ (M207), which is our proprietary formulation of zolmitriptan delivered via our ADAM technology, as an acute treatment for migraine. In February 2019, we announced the completion of the final milestone in our long-term safety study for Qtrypta™ (M207). We are focused on developing products where rapid administration of established molecules with known safety and efficacy profiles provides an increased benefit to patients, in markets where patients remain underserved by existing therapies. 
ADAM is our proprietary, investigational intracutaneous delivery system designed to offer rapid drug absorption into the bloodstream, which can result in an improved pharmacokinetic profile compared to original dosage forms. ADAM consists of an array of drug-coated titanium microneedles mounted on an adhesive backing that is pressed on to the skin using a reusable handheld applicator. The microneedles penetrate the stratum corneum and allow the drug to be absorbed into the microcapillary system of the skin. We focus on developing products based on our ADAM technology for indications in which rapid onset, ease of use and stability offer significant therapeutic and practical advantages, in markets where there is a need for more effective therapies.
Our development efforts are currently focused on our product candidate, Qtrypta™ (M207). Qtrypta™ (M207) is our proprietary formulation of zolmitriptan delivered utilizing our ADAM technology. Zolmitriptan is one of a class of serotonin receptor agonists known as triptans and is used as an acute treatment for migraine. Migraine is a debilitating neurological disease, symptoms of which include moderate to severe headache pain, nausea and vomiting, and abnormal sensitivity to light and sound. The objective of Qtrypta™ (M207) is to provide faster onset of efficacy and sustained freedom from migraine symptoms by delivering rapid absorption while avoiding exposure to the gastrointestinal ("GI") tract. Feedback from the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") on Qtrypta™ (M207)’s regulatory path has confirmed that one positive pivotal efficacy study, in addition to the required safety study, is sufficient for submission of a New Drug Application, ("NDA"), seeking approval of Qtrypta™ (M207) for the treatment of migraine, if the results are favorable.
ZOTRIP Phase 2/3 Trial Results
The ZOTRIP trial was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing three doses of Qtrypta™ (M207) (1.0mg, 1.9mg, and 3.8mg) to placebo for the treatment of a single migraine attack. As illustrated in the table below, the ZOTRIP trial results showed that the 3.8mg Qtrypta™ (M207) dose demonstrated statistically significant greater pain freedom and most bothersome symptom freedom at two hours, the co-primary endpoints of the study.

M207 Long Term Safety Study
In November 2017, we announced the initiation of enrollment in our long-term safety study for Qtrypta™ (M207) as an acute treatment of migraine (“M207-ADAM”). M207-ADAM was an open label study evaluating the safety of the 3.8mg dose of Qtrypta™ (M207) in migraine patients who had historically experienced at least two migraines per month. Patients were expected to treat a minimum of two migraines per month on average, with no maximum treatment limits. The study was conducted at 31 sites in the United States with a defined data set per protocol in which 150 subjects received repeated doses for six months and 50 subjects received repeated doses for one year. The study was open-label, with investigator visits at months one, two, three, six, nine and twelve to record adverse events, if any. The primary objective of M207-ADAM was to assess safety of Qtrypta™ (M207) during repeated use over six and twelve months. Other endpoints were electrocardiography and laboratory parameters, as well as percentage of headaches with pain-free response.
In October 2018, we announced the completion of the first phase of our long-term safety study with more than 150 evaluable subjects completing six months of treatment with Qtrypta™. In February 2019, we announced the completion of the second phase of our long-term safety study with more than 50 evaluable subjects completing one year of treatment with Qtrypta™. Throughout the clinical program, as of February 2019, over 5,800 migraine attacks have been treated with Qtrypta™. Investigators reported 831 adverse events, of which 297 were reported as application site reactions and 161 were reported as treatment related adverse events. As of February 2019, following treatment with Qtrypta™, 44% of patients reported pain freedom at two hours, 68% of patients reported relief from most bothersome symptom, while pain relief at two hours was reported for 81% of migraine attacks treated.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to make intracutaneous drug delivery a preferred delivery modality for indications where fast onset provides a therapeutic benefit to patients. Our near-term focus is the continued development of our lead product candidate, Qtrypta™ (M207). The key elements of our strategy are to:

• | Develop and commercialize Qtrypta™ (M207). We believe that Qtrypta™ (M207), if approved by the FDA, will offer significant therapeutic and practical advantages as compared to existing migraine therapeutics, including its rapid onset, ease of use and stability. We have retained worldwide commercial rights to Qtrypta™ (M207). While we currently intend to develop Qtrypta™ (M207) through FDA approval and commercialization in the United States ourselves, we are also considering collaborations with potential strategic partners to maximize the strategic value of our product and our company.


• | Focus on regulatory support and market opportunities for Qtrypta™ (M207). We intend to focus our resources on the clinical and other studies, including our long-term safety study, required for NDA filing and, if approved, would support market acceptance and expansion for Qtrypta™ (M207).


• | Pursue indications outside migraine. We have performed initial feasibility studies on a number of compounds and have observed that our ADAM intracutaneous delivery system may have potential applications for use with large molecules, small molecules, and vaccines. These programs are in CNS and other therapeutic indications, where rapid drug delivery could

provide a therapeutic benefit to patients. We are pursuing these indications ourselves but would also consider collaborations with strategic partners to further the clinical and commercial development of such product candidates. 
Qtrypta™ (M207) for Migraine
The focus of our development efforts is on our product candidate Qtrypta™ (M207), our proprietary formulation of zolmitriptan, a class of serotonin receptor agonists known as triptans, used for the treatment of migraine. Migraine is a debilitating neurological disease, symptoms of which include moderate to severe headache pain, nausea and vomiting, and abnormal sensitivity to light and sound. Our Qtrypta™ (M207) intracutaneous delivery system is applied to an individual’s upper arm to deliver zolmitriptan to the circulation, with the objective of providing rapid absorption of drug and sustained freedom of migraine symptoms while avoiding exposure to the GI tract.
According to the Migraine Research Foundation, migraine is the third most prevalent illness in the world. Migraine affects approximately 39 million people in the United States, representing approximately 18% of women, 6% of men and 10% of children in the country. Nearly one in four United States households includes someone who suffers from migraine. Migraines often last between four and 24 hours, but they may last as long as three days. According to published studies, 63% of migraine patients experience one or more migraines per month and 48% of migraine attacks occur in early morning and are already at peak intensity on awakening. Physicians recommend treating migraine at earliest detection. However, because treatment for morning migraines is often delayed, these migraines can be more difficult to treat.
The Migraine Research Foundation provides that, among women, who are disproportionately affected by migraine, 25% of migraine sufferers experience four or more severe attacks per month. Migraine attacks are estimated to lead to lost productivity costs as high as $36 billion annually in the United States and, in 2015, the medical cost of treating chronic migraine was more than $5.4 billion. In addition, more than 90% of migraine sufferers are unable to work or function normally during an attack. 
We believe that each of the currently available methods of non-oral administration, including nasal spray and subcutaneous injection, have significant disadvantages. Nasal sprays have been associated with taste disturbances. Patients are hesitant to self-administer injections and thus primarily seek an injectable triptan at an urgent care setting or at the physicians’ office. There are other delivery technologies in development, such as pulmonary delivery. However, none has been approved to date.
ZOTRIP Phase 2/3 Trial achieved statistical significance on co-primary endpoints with the 3.8mg dose
On February 13, 2017 the Company announced the results of our ZOTRIP pivotal efficacy trial for Qtrypta™ (M207). Our ZOTRIP trial was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing three doses of Qtrypta™ (M207) (1.0mg, 1.9mg, and 3.8mg) to placebo for the treatment of a single migraine attack. Subjects were enrolled in the ZOTRIP trial at 36 centers across the United States. Those subjects recruited into the trial had a history of at least one year of migraine episodes with or without aura. Upon recruitment, the subjects entered a one-month run-in period that ensured they met the key eligibility criteria of two to eight migraine attacks per month, which was documented using an electronic diary or an app on their cell phone. Subjects also identified the most bothersome symptoms and indicated the presence or absence of nausea, phonophobia or photophobia, during the episodes in the run-in period. Successfully screened subjects were then randomized into the treatment/dosing period in which they had 8 weeks to confirm and receive blinded treatment for a single migraine attack, termed “qualifying migraine,” in which the subject’s most bothersome symptom had to be present. During a qualifying migraine, subjects scored the severity of pain on a 4-point scale, the presence or absence of migraine-associated symptoms (phonophobia, photophobia, or nausea), starting pre-dose and then at several intervals over 48 hours post-dose. The co-primary endpoints for the trial were those defined in the October 2014 FDA Draft Guidance—“Migraine: Developing Drugs for Acute Treatment” as pain freedom and most bothersome symptom freedom at two hours. Safety was assessed by adverse events reported and other standard safety measures.
589 subjects were enrolled in the ZOTRIP trial, of which 365 were randomized. Of those randomized, 333 subjects were treated and are included in the safety analysis, and 321 qualified for the modified intent-to-treat ("mITT") population. With the multiple doses and multiple endpoints in the trial, a sequential testing procedure was used beginning with the highest dose and the co-primary endpoints. Since statistical significance was not achieved for most bothersome symptom in the 1.9 mg group, statistical significance cannot be claimed for testing thereafter. Therefore, p-values for secondary endpoints should be considered nominal p-values.
As illustrated in the tables and figure below, the ZOTRIP trial results demonstrated that the 3.8mg Qtrypta™ (M207) dose achieved statistically significant pain freedom and most bothersome symptom freedom at two hours. The 3.8mg dose also achieved statistical significance in the secondary endpoints of pain freedom at 45 minutes and 60 minutes and showed durability of effect on pain freedom at 24 and 48 hours. Additionally, Qtrypta™ (M207) was not associated with any SAEs. While the 1.0mg and 1.9mg doses of Qtrypta™ (M207) demonstrated statistical significance in pain freedom at two hours, they did not achieve statistical

significance in freedom from most bothersome symptom at two hours. Statistical significance is an indicator of the likelihood of an observed effect being due to the study drug rather than due to chance. The “p” value is the probability of an event occurring by chance alone. When the p value is less than 5% (0.05) the results are considered to be statistically significant.

Qtrypta™ (M207) was generally well-tolerated with no SAEs reported in the ZOTRIP trial. The most frequently reported adverse event was redness at the application site (18.3% of subjects) and all cases of redness resolved. Thirteen subjects (3.9%) reported pain at the application site; with application site pain reported as mild in all but three subjects. Additionally, five (1.5%) subjects across Qtrypta™ (M207)-treated groups reported dizziness versus zero subjects in the placebo group, and four (1.2%), subjects across Qtrypta™ (M207)-treated groups reported nausea whereas zero subjects in the placebo group reported this event.

Other endpoints included electrocardiography and laboratory parameters, as well as percentage of headaches with pain-free response.
In October 2018, we announced the completion of the first phase of our long-term safety study with more than 150 evaluable subjects completing six months of treatment with Qtrypta™. In February 2019, we announced the completion of the second phase of our long-term safety study with more than 50 evaluable subjects completing one year of treatment with Qtrypta™. Throughout the clinical program, as of February 2019, over 5,800 migraine attacks have been treated with Qtrypta™. Investigators reported 831 adverse events, of which 297 were reported as application site reactions and 161 were reported as treatment related adverse events. As of February 2019, following treatment with Qtrypta™, 44% of patients reported pain freedom at two hours, 68% of patients reported relief from most bothersome symptom, while pain relief at two hours was reported for 81% of migraine attacks treated.
Our Research Programs
Our internal research and development programs use molecules with demonstrated safety and efficacy that are formulated to enable delivery through our proprietary ADAM technology. In selecting our development candidates, we consider the therapeutic advantage of rapid onset, the size of the market, the level of competition and the potential selling price.
Our ADAM technology patch consists of a 3cm2 to 6cm2 array of titanium microneedles approximately 200-350 microns in length, coated with a hydrophilic formulation of drug, and attached to an adhesive patch. The maximum amount of drug that can be coated on a patch’s microneedle array depends on the active molecule of the drug formulation, the weight of the excipients in the drug formulation, and the coatable surface area of the microneedle array. For example, we use patches with 2cm2, 3cm2 and 6cm2 microneedle arrays. In the pivotal trial for Qtrypta™ (M207), we used two 3cm2 patches to deliver the appropriate dose. Based on our testing, we believe 3.8mg of zolmitriptan could also be coated on a single patch with a 6cm2 microneedle array while maintaining acceptable tolerability. The patch is applied with a hand-held applicator that presses the microneedles into the skin to a uniform depth in each application, close to the capillary bed, allowing for dissolution and absorption of the drug, but not deep enough to contact the nerve endings in the skin. The typical patch wear time is generally thirty to sixty minutes.
We have tested our ADAM technology in preclinical and clinical proof of concept studies that demonstrated its technical feasibility with multiple compounds, ranging from small molecules to proteins. Based on this research, we believe that our ADAM technology can be used to deliver treatments for a wide variety of indications in which rapid absorption can enhance onset of efficacy and sustainability of effect. That coupled with ease of use might offer particularly important therapeutic, practical, and commercial advantages over existing options.

Competition
Competition for our product candidate
The development and commercialization of new products to treat migraine is highly competitive. We expect to have considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do. In addition, many of these companies have longer operating histories and more experience than us in preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory and global commercialization.
Companies marketing products that treat migraine that may compete with our Qtrypta™ (M207) product candidate include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Eli Lilly & Company, AstraZeneca plc, Allergan, Inc., Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Alder Biopharmaceuticals, Amgen Inc. and Promius Pharma, LLC.
Competition in drug delivery platforms
In addition to competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies that develop and market products that compete against those that we develop, we face additional competition from companies that may develop and license drug delivery platforms similar to ours, and from alternative formulations and methods of delivery of the drugs on which we have focused, including oral formulations, nasal sprays, intracutaneous patches, intramuscular and subcutaneous injections and infusions. Such companies include, but are not limited to, 3M Company, Endo Pharmaceuticals, Corium International, Inc. and Pantec Biosolutions AG.
Research and Development and Manufacturing
As of December 31, 2018, our research and development group consisted of 38 employees, located in our headquarters in Fremont, California. Our research and development staff have broad knowledge and skills in a range of disciplines applicable to formulation of drugs and the design and manufacture of our ADAM technology. Our research and development group has particular expertise in two areas critical to our success: developing drug formulations that can be delivered using our ADAM technology and optimizing the technology to deliver those drugs.
The goals of our research and development efforts are to identify and develop drugs that can be delivered using our intracutaneous delivery system. In the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred $25.5 million and $20.1 million, respectively, of research and development expense. See Part II–Item 7–“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report for additional detail regarding our research and development activities.
We operate a manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, designed to comply with current good manufacturing practices ("cGMP") and believe we have adequate manufacturing capabilities and capacity to produce our ADAM technology for preclinical and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, and for some Phase 3 trials. We continue to expand our manufacturing capabilities and have implemented automation of certain processes to further expand our capacity. We produced 3 cGMP registration batches of Qtrypta™ (M207) in the third quarter of 2018, which will be used to support our NDA filing with the FDA. We purchase various components or intermediates of our ADAM technology from third party vendors, including titanium foil, active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients, inner ring, adhesive backing, ring and backing assembly, outer ring and primary and secondary packing components. The majority of these components and intermediaries are available from multiple sources. We also outsource the manufacturing of our applicators.
The manufacturing process for our ADAM technology patch consists of two primary operations: (1) the formation of the microneedle array, involving etching of titanium foil and subsequent pad-forming; and (2) application of the drug formulation to the microneedle array.
Intellectual Property
Our strategy is to rely on a combination of patent, trade secret and trademark laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, and to rely on license and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary technology and brand. The laws of some countries in which our products are licensed may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
As of January 8, 2019, we held exclusive licenses to or owned 25 United States patents and 6 pending United States patent applications, as well as one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty patent application, covering key features of our intracutaneous delivery system, such as formulation, methods of treatment, coating, array design, patch anchoring, patch application, delivery, manufacturing and packaging.

Index to Financial Statements

We license all of these patents and patent applications, other than an issued US patent and 3 pending US, a European and international-applications covering the formulation of Qtrypta™ (M207); and 2 US and 1 EP patents, a pending US and a pending EP application covering stable glucagon peptide formulation and a new applicator design described below, from ALZA Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson ("ALZA"), on an exclusive basis for all countries. These patents and patent applications are foundational and apply generally to our product candidate and its related applicator. Under the terms of the license agreement with ALZA, we are responsible for all development and development costs related to our intracutaneous delivery system. We are also responsible for commercializing our intracutaneous delivery system, including preparing and paying for all related regulatory filings. We are obligated to pay ALZA royalties in the low to mid-single digits on sales by us of products that would otherwise infringe one of the licensed patents or that is developed by us based on certain ALZA know-how or inventions, and to pay ALZA amounts equal to the greater of royalties in the low to mid- single digits on sales by our sublicensees of such products or a percentage in the mid-tens to low twenties of royalties received by us on sales by our sublicensees of such products. We are also obligated to pay ALZA a percentage of non-royalty revenue that we receive from our sublicensees based on sales of such products. The license agreement will terminate upon the expiration of our obligations to make the royalty and other payments described above to ALZA. Additionally, we may terminate the agreement at any time for convenience upon prior written notice to ALZA, and either party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach of the agreement by the other party.
We have filed six pending United States patent applications, two pending European applications, a pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application covering our single-use applicator and formulations of zolmitriptan and stable glucagon peptide. The last of our issued technology platform patents are projected to expire in 2027.
We rely on trade secrets to protect substantial portions of our technology. We generally seek to protect these trade secrets by entering into non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions with our employees, consultants and partners, and have restricted access to our manufacturing facilities and other technology.
We have one registered trademark to Zosano, “ZOSANO PHARMA,” Reg. No. 3705884 and six pending trademark applications: Trademark App. No. 87525805 for "ADAM," Trademark App. No. 87851807 for "QNOVIS," Trademark App. No. 87851814 for "QTRYPTA," Trademark App. No. 87855458 for "TIZOVIAL," Trademark App. No. 87855469 for "QIXONTI," and Trademark App. No. 87855481 "AXILARIM." 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
United States—FDA Process
The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Our product candidate is subject to regulation by the FDA as a drug/device combination product. A combination product generally is defined as a product comprised of components from two or more regulatory categories (e.g., drug/device, device/biologic, drug/biologic). Each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component, whether a new drug, biologic or device. To facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and regulation of the overall product based upon a determination by the FDA of the primary mode of action of the combination product. The determination whether a product is a combination product, or two separate products is made by the FDA on a case-by-case basis. We have discussed our development strategy with the FDA on our Qtrypta™ (M207) program and we believe the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval of our product candidate. Accordingly, we have investigated Qtrypta™ (M207) through the Investigational New Drug ("IND") framework and plan to seek approval through the NDA pathway. Based on our discussion with the FDA to date, we do not anticipate that the FDA will require a separate medical device authorization for the device component of Qtrypta™ (M207), but this could change during its review of any marketing application that we may submit.
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and devices pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending marketing applications, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution.
Drug Approval Process
None of our product candidates may be marketed in the United States until the product has received FDA approval. The steps to be completed before a drug may be marketed in the United States include:

Index to Financial Statements


• | preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the U.S. may begin and must be updated annually;


• | approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB"), at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practice ("GCP") requirements, to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication to the FDA’s satisfaction;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;


• | FDA acceptance and review of the NDA, which may require an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP; and


• | FDA approval of the NDA.

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, product chemistry, controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the U.S. may begin. An IND will automatically become effective thirty days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. We submitted an IND for Qtrypta™ (M207) in the second quarter of 2016.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials necessary for product approval are typically conducted in the following three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. 

• | Phase 1: In Phase 1, through the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness.


• | Phase 2: Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks.


• | Phase 3: Phase 3 trials help obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances.

Phase 4 clinical trials are conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication or otherwise when requested by the FDA in the form of post-market commitments. Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 post-market studies could result in withdrawal of approval. 
The trial protocol and informed consent information for trial subjects in clinical trials must also be approved by an IRB for each institution where the trials will be conducted, and each IRB must monitor the trial until completion. Trial subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. Clinical testing also must comply with extensive laws, rules and GCP regulations, including requirements for informed consent, and laws and regulations governing privacy of individually identifiable information.
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program user fees. Section 505(b)(1) and Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA are the provisions 
9

Index to Financial Statements

governing the type of NDAs that may be submitted under the FDCA. Section 505(b)(1) is the traditional pathway for new chemical entities when no other new drug containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredient or active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance, has been approved by the FDA. As an alternate pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations of previously approved products, a company may file a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The FDA reviews any NDA submitted to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before the FDA accepts the NDA for filing. 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that such NDA is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the NDA for filing. FDA reviews NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. The FDA endeavors to review Standard Review applications within ten to twelve months, whereas FDA's goal is to review Priority Review applications within six to eight months, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity. Even if the NDA is filed, companies cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may also refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. 
The FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, or may condition the approval of an NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. Further, the FDA may place conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS") to assure the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. If the FDA requires a REMS, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If a REMS is required as part of any commercialization effort, it could materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following the initial marketing of the product.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA usually will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing is in compliance with cGMP regulations. If the FDA does not approve of the NDA or the manufacturing facilities, it will issue a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information required for the FDA to reconsider the application. If the NDA and the manufacturing facilities are deemed acceptable by the FDA, it may issue an approval letter. The approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy or impose other conditions. Approval may also be contingent on an approved REMS that limits the labeling, distribution or promotion of a drug product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indication(s) and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA has indicated that our product candidate Qtrypta™ (M207) is covered by the PREA, but the FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of an applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Before a company can market products for additional indications, it must obtain additional approvals from the FDA. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical trials be conducted. A company cannot be sure that any additional approval for new indications for any product candidate will be approved on a timely basis, or at all.
Post-Approval Requirements
10

Index to Financial Statements

Oftentimes, even after a drug has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical trials. If such post-approval conditions are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, holders of an approved NDA are required to (i) report certain adverse reactions to the FDA, (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products, and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP regulations after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing facilities. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. This latter effort includes assessment of ongoing compliance with cGMP regulations. We have used and intend to continue to use third party manufacturers to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients, (“API”), for our product candidate in clinical and commercial quantities, and future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug's benefits outweigh its risks. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, including withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of the drug.
The FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for products under its jurisdiction both prior to and after approval. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, and often reflect a physician’s belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for the patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA.
Hatch-Waxman Act
As part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, which provide alternative pathways to regulatory approval through section 505(i) and 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, were enacted. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(i) permits applicants with generic drug products to submit an abbreviated new drug application ("ANDA") in reliance upon certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. Under these pathways, the FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by Section 505(b)(2) applicant. We anticipate seeking approval of our product candidate through a 505(b)(2) NDA.
To the extent that an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, which is referred to as the Reference Listed Drug, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any listed patents in the FDA’s Orange Book publication that relate to the Reference Listed Drug. Specifically, the applicant must certify for all listed patents one of the following certifications: (i) the required patent information has not been filed by the original applicant; (ii) the listed patent already has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the new product.
If a Paragraph I or II certification is filed, the FDA may make approval of the application effective immediately upon completion of its review. If a Paragraph III certification is filed, the approval may be made effective on the patent expiration date specified in the application, although a tentative approval may be issued before that time. A certification that the new product will not infringe the Reference Listed Drug's listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph IV certification. If an application contains a Paragraph IV certification, a series of events will be triggered, the outcome of which will determine the effective date of approval of the new application. The application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the Referenced Listed Drug has expired.
If the applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders for the Reference Listed Drug once the applicant’s NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a legal challenge to the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of their receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA by imposing a 30-month automatic stay on approval, which may be shortened by the court in a pending patent case if either party fails to reasonably cooperate in expediting the case. The 30-month stay terminates if a court issues a final order determining that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. Alternatively, if the listed patent 
11

Index to Financial Statements

holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the applicant’s NDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay.
The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five years of data exclusivity for new chemical entities which prevents the FDA from accepting ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications, including Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, containing the protected active ingredient. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of market exclusivity for applications containing the results of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the FDA’s approval of new uses of approved products such as new indications, delivery mechanisms, dosage forms, strengths, or conditions of use. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the three-year exclusivity period.
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Sales of products that we may market in the future, and our ability to generate revenues on such sales, are dependent, in significant part, on the availability of coverage and the level of reimbursement from third party payers such as state and federal governments, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Private insurers, such as health maintenance organizations and managed care providers, have implemented cost-cutting and reimbursement initiatives and likely will continue to do so in the future. These include establishing formularies that govern the drugs and biologics that will be offered and also the out-of-pocket obligations of member patients for such products. In addition, particularly in the United States and increasingly in other countries, we will be required to provide discounts and pay rebates to state and federal governments and agencies in connection with purchases of any of our products, if approved, that are reimbursed by such entities. We have consciously selected compounds for development that offer therapeutic benefit based on fast onset of action. If our product candidate is approved by the FDA, we intend to work with payers to demonstrate the clinical benefits of our products over other delivery modalities and we intend to secure adequate and commercially favorable pricing and reimbursement levels, but we cannot guarantee that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available.
In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidate that we develop may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek coverage and reimbursement from third party payors. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. 
The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Additionally, in the United States there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Third party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will likely be a time-consuming process. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only at limited levels, successful commercialization of, and obtaining a satisfactory financial return on, any product we develop may not be possible.
Third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, we may need to conduct expensive studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third party payors may not consider our product or product candidate to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies 
Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs (including drug prices) has become a priority of federal and state governments. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution by generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. If these third party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products or product candidates if approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. Decreases in third party reimbursement for our products once approved or a decision by a third party payor to not cover our products could 
12

Index to Financial Statements

reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have an adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, state and federal healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or product candidates once approved or additional pricing pressures.
Healthcare Reform 
A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (“ACA”), which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidate are:

• | An annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures, or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;


• | Beginning in 2013, entities that manufacture, produce or import medical devices were required to pay an excise tax in an amount equal to 2.3% of the price for which such devices are sold in the United States. Through a series of legislative amendments, the tax was suspended for 2016 through 2019, but is scheduled to return beginning in 2020, absent further Congressional action.


• | Expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; and


• | A new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of two percent (2%) per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. 
On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the ACA was invalid due to the legislative repeal of the individual mandate. While the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. There may be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. In addition, Congress could consider subsequent legislation to replace repealed elements of the ACA. At this time, the full effect of the ACA and any subsequent legislation or related regulatory action on our business remains unclear.
If we establish international operations, we will be subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA for activities by our partners, collaborators, contract research organizations, vendors or other agents.
Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights or acquisitions may be subject to national or supranational antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
Healthcare providers and third party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted regulatory approval. Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, many of which may become more applicable to us if our product candidate is approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations, including those described below. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease or order of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
The federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under ACA, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, certain other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals and information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willingly executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on covered entities and their business associates that perform certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on their behalf.
We are also and may become subject to analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers. 
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 53 employees, all of whom are full time, 5 of whom hold doctorate degrees in their respective scientific and pharmaceutical fields and 1 of whom holds a Doctor of Medicine degree. We make extensive use of third party contractors, consultants and advisors to perform many of our present activities.
Special Stockholder Meeting, Reverse Split and Authorized Share Increase
On January 23, 2018, we held a special meeting of stockholders. At the special meeting, the stockholders approved, among other things, an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 250,000,000 shares. A Certificate of Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizing the authorized share increase was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 24, 2018, and the authorized share increase became effective in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Amendment upon filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.
14

The stockholders also approved a proposal authorizing the board of directors, in its discretion, to effect a reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio ranging from 1-for-5 to 1-for-20 to be determined by the Board of Directors and effected, if at all, no later than November 23, 2018. On January 23, 2018, following the special stockholder meeting, the board of directors approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of the common stock and the filing of a Certificate of Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company to effectuate the reverse stock split. A Certificate of Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizing the reverse stock split was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 24, 2018, and the reverse stock split became effective in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Amendment at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 25, 2018, which we refer to as the Effective Time.
At the Effective Time, every twenty shares of common stock issued and outstanding was automatically combined into one share of issued and outstanding common stock, without any change in the par value per share. The reverse stock split did not affect the number of authorized shares of common stock, which, after giving effect to the authorized share increase, is 250,000,000 shares. In addition, a proportionate adjustment was made to the per share exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of the Company’s outstanding equity awards, options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock and the number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company’s equity incentive compensation plans.
