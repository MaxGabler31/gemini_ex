Overview
 
Sonnet BioTherapeutics Holdings, Inc., is a clinical stage, oncology-focused biotechnology company with a proprietary platform for innovating biologic medicines of single- or bi-specific action. Known as FHAB™ (Fully Human Albumin Binding), the technology utilizes a fully human single chain antibody fragment that binds to and “hitch-hikes” on human serum albumin for transport to target tissues. We designed the FHAB construct to improve drug accumulation in the cancer tumors well as to extend the duration of activity in the body. FHAB development candidates are produced in a mammalian cell culture, which enables glycosylation and a biological structure similar to the natural cytokines in vivo. We believe our FHAB technology, for which we received a U.S. patent in June 2021, is a distinguishing feature of our biopharmaceutical platform that is well suited for future drug development across a range of human disease areas, including oncology, autoimmune, pathogenic, inflammatory, and hematological conditions.
 
Our current internal pipeline development activities are focused on cytokines, a class of cell signaling peptides that, among other important functions, serve as potent immunomodulatory agents. Working both independently and synergistically, specific cytokines have shown the ability to modulate the activation and maturation of immune cells that fight cancer and pathogens. However, cytokines on their own do not preferentially accumulate in specific tissues and are quickly eliminated from the body, the conventional approach to achieving a treatment effect with cytokine therapy typically requires the administration of high and frequent doses. This can result in a reduced treatment effect accompanied by the potential for systemic toxicity, which poses challenges to the therapeutic application of this class of drugs.
 
Sonnet has built an efficient R&D platform that includes a network of outsourced vendors to help remediate expenses and improve execution timelines. Most of the vendors are strategic collaborators that offer the company a preferred status with negotiated costs. The major advantages of this approach include optimized direct investment into projects with expenses that can be rapidly scaled up or down depending on the number of projects. The cost advantages of the Sonnet platform start at the vendor network selection process, with CMC being one of the most expensive components of the initial drug development step. Sonnet has chosen a strategic CMC collaborator in India and has negotiated the cost to be significantly less than the expense incurred from a similar US- or Europe-based vendor. Sonnet is conducting two of the company’s three ongoing clinical trials in Australia, which carries a substantial cost reduction relative to US trials via the Australian government’s R&D credit program. Sonnet is also coordinating the Indian and Australian execution with top R&D vendors from the US, England, Germany, and Switzerland, with the objective of directing the bulk of the company’s operating expense infrastructure towards its drug development pipeline.
 
Pipeline 
 
We have a pipeline of therapeutic compounds focused primarily on oncology indications of high unmet medical need.
 

● | Our lead proprietary asset, SON-1010, is a fully human single-chain version of Interleukin 12 (“IL-12”), covalently linked to the FHAB construct, for which we are pursuing clinical development in solid tumors. Sonnet has completed a non-human primate (“NHP”) GLP toxicity study and has successfully manufactured both liquid and lyophilized forms of the drug product for clinical use. During the first half of 2022, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in the US in cancer patients, as well as an Australian clinical trial in healthy volunteers to study the compound’s pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). The interim safety data from both clinical studies were presented during the fourth calendar quarter of 2022. These data set the stage for the next phase of clinical development, which includes exploring combination treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor. Data from the primary analyses of both trials are expected during the second calendar quarter of 2023.

● | The Company acquired the global development rights to a fully human version of Interleukin 6 (“IL-6”), in April 2020. We refer to this candidate as SON-080, for its target indications of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (“CIPN”) and Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (“DPN”). Sonnet’s CIPN Phase 1B/IIA clinical trial is underway in Australia. This study could yield initial top line clinical safety data during the first half of 2023. Pursuant to a license agreement the Company entered with New Life Therapeutics Pte., Ltd (“New Life”) of Singapore in May 2021, Sonnet and New Life will be jointly responsible for developing SON-080 in DPN with the objective of initiating an ex-US pilot efficacy study in the second half of 2023. 
● | SON-1210 (IL12-FHAB-IL15), our lead bispecific compound, combines the FHAB construct with fully human IL-12 and fully human Interleukin 15 (IL-15). This compound is being developed for solid tumor indications, including colorectal cancer. The in-life portion of a non-human primate (NHP) study is on track to complete in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022, with initiation of the regulatory authorization process to commence during the first half of 2023. Manufacturing and drug supply are secured with a lyophilized drug product formulation being prepared during the first calendar quarter of 2023, which is expected to be suitable for first-in-human clinical trials. 

 
In our discovery pipeline, we are investigating:
 

● | SON-1410 (IL18-FHAB-IL12), a bispecific combination of Interleukins 18 (IL-18) and 12 (IL-12) for melanoma and renal cancers. Cell line development and process development are ongoing, with early experimental drug supply suitable for formulation and analytical method development activities, in addition to small quantities for use in early development proof-of-concept in vitro studies. Process development activities will continue through 2023, with the potential to generate drug suitable for initial in vivo mouse studies by the end of the 2023 calendar year. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SON-3015 (anti-IL6- FHAB-anti-TGFβ), a bispecific combination of anti-IL6 and anti-Tumor Growth Factor Beta for tumor and bone metastases. Early-stage bispecific drug has been generated and has been stored for future use in in vivo mouse studies. Sonnet has elected to place the SON-3015 development program on hold for expense reduction purposes.

We face numerous challenges and uncertainties with respect to the development and commercialization of our therapeutic compounds, including our FHAB technology. Please see “Risk Factors” contained elsewhere in this prospectus, and the sections entitled “Risk Factors” in the documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus.
 
Strategy
 
Our goal is to rapidly advance our pipeline and leverage our therapeutic FHAB platform to become a leader in the discovery, development, and commercialization of biologic drugs. Since its founding, Sonnet has remained focused on rapidly progressing pipeline candidates towards the clinic, while also working to establish collaborations with suitable partners. As partnership conversations evolve, Sonnet intends to prioritize its expense allocation on assets with the greatest strategic interest. To this end, Sonnet is working to reduce operating expenses by approximately 30% and intends to negotiate a licensing deal that will help fund future pipeline expansion. As one example of an announcement in its early stages, Janssen is evaluating three of our pipeline compounds, SON-1010, SON-1210 and SON-1410, in combination with its cell therapy products.
 
FHAB program advancement: We submitted an IND for SON-1010 to the FDA during the second half of 2021 and completed all of our responses to the agency in early 2022. Our first-in-human clinical study was initiated during the first calendar quarter of 2022. Regarding our first bispecific candidate, SON-1210, GMP bulk drug substance is manufactured and is expected to be ready for clinical applications during the first half of 2023.
 
Progress SON-080 into the next phase of clinical development: SON-080 is a fully human version of low dose Interleukin 6 (IL-6) being studied for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). SON-080 has successfully completed Phase I/II clinical trials in cancer patients and we initiated a pilot efficacy Phase Ib/IIa study in CIPN patients during the second half 2022.
 
Manufacturing platform: Sonnet compounds are produced using an industry standard mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary/CHO) host cell line that allows for rapid scale-up and commercial manufacturing using state-of-the-art, manufacturing processes and technologies. The mammalian cell culture system enables glycosylation and a similar biological structure to the natural cytokines in vivo. The manufacture of cytokines for clinical applications, namely their production and purification, poses distinct technical challenges. To this end, Sonnet has developed a continuous intensive perfusion process to manufacture commercial yields and we are seeking intellectual property protection for certain of these manufacturing and downstream process development steps.
 
Regulatory strategy: We believe that Sonnet’s drug candidates are significantly differentiated from existing therapies and represent potential breakthroughs in biopharmaceutical drug development. We will endeavor to seek breakthrough therapy designations with regulatory agencies, which could potentially lead to accelerated clinical development timelines.
 
Pipeline licensing opportunities: We are pursuing partnering opportunities with leading biopharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our pipeline assets.
 
FHAB technology expansion: Sonnet is exploring FHAB technology licenses with external partners interested in expanding its therapeutic deployment, which we believe could lead to the platform’s application in other areas, such as vaccines, antibody drug conjugates and as a supplement to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell technology. Provisional patents have been filed to secure exclusivity with FHAB in these fields.
 
The FHAB Technology
 
Our proprietary FHAB technology was engineered to address several important shortcomings of existing approaches to biopharmaceutical drug development. We designed FHAB as a plug-and-play, modular construct for innovating new chemical entities that does not need to be reconfigured for different therapeutic payloads. As is the case with all biologic drugs, dose level and frequency of administration are critical variables that oftentimes present as barriers to the development process. After injection, large molecule therapeutics, including peptides, proteins, fusion proteins, antibodies and the like, must remain intact and be capable of reaching their designated targets inside the body, without exceeding specific toxicity thresholds. Finally, they must also be produced using commercially attractive means.
 
Sonnet’s platform technology was designed to harness human serum albumin (HSA) as a therapeutic shuttling molecule. HSA is naturally present in the bloodstream and the predominant protein in blood plasma. Albumin is a source of energy for inflamed, hypermetabolic tissues, including tumors. Due to the active need for nutrients, cancer cells overexpress albumin-binding proteins such as SPARC (Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine) and gp60 (Albondin glycoprotein).

Pursuant to a Discovery Collaboration Agreement, dated July 23, 2012 and to an Amendment of Discovery Collaboration Agreement, dated May 7, 2019 (together, the “Collaboration Agreement”), XOMA (US) LLC (“XOMA”) granted to Sonnet a non-exclusive, non-transferrable license and/or right to use certain materials, technologies and information related to the discovery, optimization and development of antibodies and related proteins and to develop and commercialize products thereunder (each, a “Product”). The Collaboration Agreement included a license to use a fully human bacteriophage library that was designed to generate fully human single-chain antibody fragments (‘scFv’) comprising a full repertoire of human heavy and light chains for use in panning biological sequences for specific functions. Applying stringent criteria, Sonnet panned millions of scFv binders to HSA to generate Sonnet’s FHAB, which binds to HSA, a globular protein having three major domains. It is known that albumin domains 1 and 3 are involved in the binding to FcRn. This allowed Sonnet to select and characterize scFv binders specific to domain 2, a foundation of Sonnet’s FHAB platform.
 
Sonnet is obligated to make contingent milestone payments to XOMA totaling $3.75 million on a Product-by-Product basis upon the achievement of certain development and approval milestones related to a Product. Sonnet has also agreed to pay XOMA low single-digit royalties on net sales of Products sold by Sonnet. Royalties on each Product are payable on a country-by-country basis until the later of (i) twelve (12) years after the First Commercial Sale (as defined in the Collaboration Agreement), and (ii) the date of expiration of the last valid claim in the last-to-expire of the issued patents covered by the Collaboration Agreement. In addition, Sonnet has the right to reduce the rate of the royalty on a Product-by-Product basis by paying XOMA a specified amount. The Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by either party for cause and contains customary indemnification provisions.
 
Sonnet’s FHAB has demonstrated a high binding affinity to serum albumin across species (human, mouse and cynomolgus monkey), with little-to-no immunogenicity, and retains the benefits of neonatal FcRn-mediated recycling of albumin for extending serum half-life by up to four weeks. Unlike monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), this binding occurs without invoking ADCC (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity) and CDC (complement-dependent cytotoxicity). The FHAB construct physically binds serum albumin through an ionic, hydrophobic mechanism, which we believe offers a distinct advantage over technologies that rely on chemical, covalent binding. Once broken, a covalent bond cannot reform, whereas Sonnet’s FHAB is designed with the ability to bind, unbind and rebind to albumin. As albumin seeks albumin receptor gp60 and SPARC, FHAB leverages innate biological mechanisms for targeted delivery of the therapeutic payload to the tumor microenvironment.
 
Another unique advantage of Sonnet’s FHAB is its linker design. Used for attaching one or two large molecule therapeutic payloads, for single or bispecific activity, our G4S (glycine, serine) peptide linkers are flexible, while being long enough to prevent steric hindrance, and can assume a rod-like configuration for enhanced penetration of tight tissue matrices. In addition to maintaining distance between the therapeutic functional domains, Sonnet linkers are fully human and non-immunogenic across the linker structure, including at the payload binding region. In bispecific constructs, the orientation of the therapeutic payloads can be manipulated to improve potential treatment effects.

As a final key design component, FHAB is produced in mammalian cell culture, specifically Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, which enables glycosylation for reducing or potentially eliminating immunogenicity. Using CHO, we have created several different genetic fusion constructs with various low molecular weight therapeutic proteins (e.g., recombinant cytokines such as IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, anti-IL-6 and anti-TGFβ). Recombinant therapeutic proteins, including cytokines, have shown great therapeutic potential, but can lack tissue specificity, which can lead to toxicity. Due to their small (<50kDa) size, cytokines also suffer from a shorter circulation half-life (minutes-to-hours versus 21 days) versus monoclonal antibodies. In mouse and non-human primate models, FHAB-derived compounds have demonstrated substantially greater serum half-lives, improved tissue accumulation and marked tumor reduction activity when compared to their respective naked recombinant cytokines.
 
In summary, our FHAB technology underpins a modular, versatile scaffold that can be customized to yield a broad array of multi-targeted therapeutic candidates. Relative to existing albumin binding technologies, FHAB is differentiated by possessing a linear, rod-like shape designed for better target tissue penetration, a fully human design to reduce immunogenicity, mammalian glycosylation and FcRn binding for longer serum half-life. Importantly, FHAB-derived therapeutics have the potential for targeted delivery, reduced toxicity and wider therapeutic windows, with the added benefit of utilizing a tailored single or bispecific mechanism of action.
 
Expanded Applications of the FHAB Technology:
 
Immunotherapy: We believe that our FHAB platform can innovate biologic drugs that target specific tissues while also increasing therapeutic half-life. As the FHAB construct is designed to enable the simultaneous deployment of two synergistic immunotherapy compounds, we envision a path to previously untapped immunotherapeutic advancements.
 
Drug Conjugation: With the FHAB technology, various drug compounds can be linked to the FHAB scaffold in combinations that extend beyond our first-wave pipeline of cytokines, which presents opportunities for development across myriad disease areas.
 
Vaccines: Vaccine developers are seeking to improve vaccine efficiency by conjugating vaccines to natural carriers, such as albumin. We believe the FHAB platform, with its modular scaffold structure, could be an efficient vehicle for delivering vaccines to lymph nodes, improving penetration and presentation, and extending half-life.
 
CAR T-cell Therapy: CAR T-cell therapy involves genetically modifying a patient’s own T cells to recognize cancer cells for more effectively targeting and killing tumors. We believe targeted Sonnet constructs utilizing interleukins could be systemically co-administered to enhance CAR T-cell efficacy.

SON-1010
 
Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is a circulating cytokine that has been shown to exert multiple effects on innate and adaptive immunity. These immune functions are critical in attacking cancer cells and pathogens. IL-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine produced by dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages, also known as antigen presenting cells (APC’s). IL-12 has been shown to induce interferon gamma (IFN-ɣ) secretion by T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, promote the expansion and survival of activated T-cells and NK cells, supplement the cytolytic activity of cytotoxic T cells, support the differentiation of Th1 helper effector cells and enhance antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). IL-12 has also been shown to stimulate in vitro antitumor activity of lymphocytes from patients with cancer and in vivo anti-tumor activity in murine tumor models of melanoma, colon carcinoma, mammary carcinoma and sarcoma.
 
In May 2021, we announced the successful completion of a GLP repeat-dose study of SON-1010 in non-human primates (NHPs). The objectives of the study were to evaluate the toxicity of SON-1010 in NHP using a subcutaneous, repeat-dose regimen at three different dose levels versus untreated controls and to evaluate the potential reversibility of any adverse findings. Study results included:
 

● | The No Observed Adverse Event Level (NOAEL) following repeated administration was more than 50 times the anticipated equivalent human clinical dose in NHP with no evidence of cytokine release syndrome. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of serum samples confirmed an enhanced profile of IL12-FHAB over recombinant human IL-12, with a half-life around 40 hours in NHP. 
● | A significant increase in Interferon-γ, a key pleiotropic cytokine associated with anti-tumor mechanisms, was observed following dosing with IL12-FHAB. 
● | SON-1010 related changes in clinical observations, body weight, clinical pathology, cytokines, and immunophenotyping were seen, all of which were consistent with on-target effects previously observed in nonhuman primates. 
● | By Day 38 all study subjects recovered to baseline (pre-study) values. 
● | Repeat dosing administration was tolerated at all dose levels examined. 

 
In February 2021, we announced the successful completion of an NHP non-GLP repeat-dose toxicology study of SON-1010, the data from which were used to inform the design of the GLP toxicity studies in preparation for IND submission. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the toxicity of SON-1010 in a repeat dose regimen at two different doses and to gather critical data for the design of further IND-enabling safety and toxicity studies. The study included both intravenous and subcutaneous routes of administration with a total of two doses given 14 days apart. The high dosage rate utilized in this study was greater than 50 times the anticipated clinical level of exposure to patients. Study results included:
 

● | Repeat dosing by intravenous and subcutaneous routes of administration was tolerated at both dose levels examined. As is typically observed with IL-12 administration, the white blood cell count dropped, and liver enzymes (ALT and AST) were elevated. These were transient effects that returned to baseline within 7 days following the second dose. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | SON-1010-related changes in the physiological observations, body weight, pathology, cytokines and immunophenotyping were seen, all of which were consistent with those on-target effects previously observed in single dose studies. 
● | A significant increase in Interferon-γ levels, a key pleiotropic cytokine associated with anti-tumor activity, was observed following the initial dose of SON-1010 with lower Interferon-γ levels observed following the second dose. This trend follows the published data from other studies of IL-12 in both humans and NHPs. 
● | Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated a mean serum half-life of approximately 40 hours in animals administered SON-1010 via subcutaneous injection. This is consistent with data from the previously conducted dose escalation phase of the study, which demonstrates a substantial improvement in half-life compared to the 13-19-hour half-life of naked, recombinant human IL-12. 

 
Additionally, SON-1010 has demonstrated, preclinically, a larger reduction of tumor growth compared to IL-12 without FHAB (naked/standalone IL-12) in a mouse model of melanoma. Figure 2 below, from this mouse melanoma study, illustrates SON-1010’s 30-to-50-fold increase in tumor reduction compared to standalone IL-12 WT (wild type).
 
Furthermore, in the same model, SON-1010 accumulated in tumors in higher concentrations and remained in the serum, spleen, and tumor significantly longer than IL-12 WT without FHAB, potentially enabling less frequent administration and at lower doses.
 

Figure 2: IL-12 (1µg) and IL12- FHAB (1.3µg) are molar equivalent and have similar bioactivity, in vitro; however, in vivo, IL12- FHAB is approximately 30-fold more potent than IL-12 (at day 10, 1.3µg IL12- FHAB > IL-12 30µg).
 
In another preclinical study using a B16G tumor model, SON-1010 demonstrated an improved dose response versus standalone IL-12 WT, along with increased survival duration (Figures 3 and 4).
 
Results from this study suggest that SON-1010 may have a greater effect on reducing tumor volume and extending survival versus standalone IL-12 WT.

Figure 3: Analysis of tumor volumes shows dose-dependent decreases in tumors in both IL-12 WT and IL12- FHAB-treated mice, as compared to vehicle control. IL12- FHAB-treated mice showed large, statistically significant decreases in tumor volumes when analyzed against equimolar-dosed, IL-12 WT-treated mice. Results suggest IL-12 anti-tumor activity is potentially enhanced with the extension of serum half-life by FHAB linkage.
 
In Figure 4, below, a Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to compare survival between animals treated with either SON-1010 or IL-12 WT. These data illustrate a correlation between the percent rate decrease in tumor growth (Figure 3) and an increase in survival duration (Figure 4). In this study, the slower growth of tumors in animals treated with SON-1010 correlates with a longer survival time, as compared to more rapid tumor growth observed with naked IL-12 WT treatment.
 
Survivability at the lowest doses of SON-1010 (3µg) was equivalent to the highest dose of IL-12 WT (30µg). All doses of SON-1010 showed a 50% survival increase over vehicle at 14 and 17.5 days.
 

Figure 4: Kaplan-Meier evaluation of mouse B16F tumor survivability shows an increase in survival with IL12- FHAB treatment. Doses of 10µg and 20µg of standalone IL-12 WT exhibited 50% survival at 2 and 4 days over vehicle control (10 days). All doses of IL12- FHAB showed 50% survival over vehicle at 14 and 17.5 days. Survivability at the lowest doses of IL12- FHAB were equivalent to highest dose standalone IL-12.

We have completed in vitro pharmacology studies of affinity and binding kinetics that demonstrate species cross-reactivity of SON-1010 in serum albumin for hamster, rat, cynomolgus monkey and human. The results show that SON-1010 displays species specificity to cynomolgus monkey and human subjects, which will guide species selection for further preclinical toxicology work. A humanized mouse model (SCID) study designed to evaluate PK/PD and dose response is completed. This work informed our decision about dosing in a nonhuman primate (NHP) study.
 
The objectives of this NHP dose range-finding study were twofold, to confirm the enhanced PK profile of SON-1010 in comparison to recombinant human IL-12 (demonstrated previously in a humanized mouse model), and to perform a dose escalation to inform and de-risk the design of follow-on NHP studies needed for the SON-1010 IND filing with the FDA. The data from this study indicate that in healthy cynomolgus macaques of both sexes, a single dose of SON-1010 is well tolerated at dosage levels greater than 50 times the anticipated exposure in human clinical trials. Additionally, SON-1010 elicited a prolonged and potent on-target PD effect as measured by, Interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a key biomarker of antitumor activity. On-target and transient changes in clinical chemistry and pathology parameters were observed but resolved completely within 14 to 21 days post-dosing. Signs of cytokine imbalance, or uncontrolled increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were notably absent from all dose levels tested in the study. Pharmacokinetic analysis of serum samples from the study animals indicated a mean half-life of 40.0 (±6.9) hours for the subcutaneous route of administration and 27.45 (±2.8) hours for intravenous dosing. These results build on those from the work with the B16F10 mouse model of melanoma, where the mouse version of SON-1010 showed a 20-fold reduction in the dosage required to achieve a similar therapeutic effect compared to mouse IL-12. Taken together, we believe the observed extended half-life, improved therapeutic window and reduced dosing requirement, made possible by Sonnet’s FHAB technology, represent key advantages of SON-1010 as a potential immune oncology therapeutic.
 
Work on the master cell bank expressing SON-1010, formulation development and process development activities have all been completed, in addition to drug product formulation (liquid and lyophilized). Process transfer and cGMP product manufacturing is complete. The GLP, IND-enabling toxicology study has been completed. We submitted an IND to FDA during the second half of 2021.
 
Following FDA approval, we initiated a US clinical trial in oncology patients with solid tumors in April 2022. We also initiated an Australian single-ascending dose (SAD) clinical study in healthy volunteers in July 2022 to carefully study the PK and PD in preparation for potential combination studies. The safety of SON-1010 dosing in several cohorts has been formally reviewed in both Phase 1 clinical trials and dose escalation is continuing as early data becomes available. No dose-limiting toxicities have occurred to date using this novel approach to enhance the safety of the cytokine-based immunotherapy. The clinical dose-escalation strategy was developed based on the ability to use this non-cytotoxic drug in a study in healthy volunteers to rapidly provide clean PK/PD data without interpretation challenges from prior cancer treatment effects. The initial safety and PD data are being used to evaluate the immune response to SON-1010 and predict the effect of further dose escalation. IL-12 has been shown to stimulate the production of interferon-gamma (IFNγ), which is necessary for its antitumor effects. Sonnet is using the known protective effects of IL-12 dose timing to minimize toxicity and extend the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
 
SON-080 (Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy)
 
Through our pipeline expansion efforts, we have identified Interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a cytokine with important biological properties when delivered as a standalone molecule. Our lead clinical stage asset, SON-080, is a fully human version of IL-6 manufactured in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. SON-080 has completed Phase I/II clinical trials in cancer patients with thrombocytopenia and in healthy volunteers and will advance to the next stage of development in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), a common side effect of treatment with antineoplastic agents in cancer. CIPN is a debilitating condition that manifests itself as pain, numbness and tingling in the extremities. It has been reported in as many as 70% of patients undergoing specific cancer regimens and is a leading cause of patients prematurely aborting chemotherapy. In animal experiments designed to replicate the clinical symptoms of CIPN, SON-080 presented disease-modifying characteristics, including the potential to repair damaged nerves.
 
Based on the preclinical work, we believe that SON-080 can potentially regenerate damaged nerves, thereby addressing not only the pain-related symptoms, but also the profound discomfort and motor disability CIPN patients often experience. In the nervous system, IL-6 has exhibited potential neurotrophic-like properties, inducing anti-apoptotic gene expression, protecting neurons from toxic injuries, and promoting nerve regeneration and remyelination. SON-080 has demonstrated the potential to elicit nerve regrowth and to re-establish both normal nerve function (Figure 5) and sensations (Figure 6) in various preclinical models of CIPN induced by cisplatin, taxol or vincristine. Activity from treatment with SON-080 was also observed in preclinical models of type 2 diabetic neuropathy and other diseases affecting the nervous system or other organs. This broad activity suggests that the SON-080 mechanism of action might not be restricted to a given class of chemotherapeutic drugs and could elicit a universal neuroprotective-neurorestorative response. Additionally, preclinical data point to the potential of SON-080 to elicit both preventive and curative activity in neuropathies (Figure 6). This introduces the possibility of treating cancer survivors who still suffer from neuropathies, a population representing between 10% and 60% of the 14 million cancer survivors in the US.

Figure 6: Data show preventive and curative activity potentiating restoration of normal sensitivity (here, using a behavioral response to hot stimulus in cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy).
 
SON-080 has completed Phase I/II studies in over 200 cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. Trial enrollees received subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.25 to 32 µg/kg daily, or thrice weekly. In these trials, where solid tumor cancers were present in more than 75% of the patients treated, the cumulative doses of IL-6 averaged in the 8000 μg range (122 - 54880 μg), and the mean duration of treatment equaled 28 days. One of the trials covered six chemotherapy cycles, with an IL-6 treatment period extending up to 203 days. In none of these trials was an exacerbation of either cancer or neuropathy observed.
 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SON-080 was determined in four studies by means of cohort dose escalations of sequential SON-080 dose groups utilizing established common toxicity criteria. When administered daily, the MTD following subcutaneous injection was determined to be between 3 and 8 μg/kg. When given thrice weekly, the MTD was estimated to be > 10 μg/kg. The most clinically relevant apparent toxicities that defined the treatment-limiting dose in these studies were flu-like symptoms and neurocortical toxicity manifested by somnolence, restlessness, confusion, hallucination, and disorientation. We anticipate using a dose that is 50-fold less than the MTD and expect a more benign adverse event profile going forward.
 
Figure 7 below summarizes the adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) reported from the Phase I/II clinical studies that are believed to have resulted from treatment with IL-6.

Figure 7: Summary of AEs and SAEs in cancer patients who received IL-6 either concomitantly or following chemotherapy. Doses tested included a range from 0.25 to 26 µg/kg, for a total drug exposure that ranged from 1 to 54,880 mg.
 
These data form the basis of our forthcoming clinical trials in CIPN, where dosing is expected to be significantly below MTD, as supported by our preclinical studies. For comparison, our target dose will provide a cumulative dose that is 25 times below the mean cumulative dose reached for similar period dosing. We also believe SON-080 has significant potential for treating other neuropathies including diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), as well as potentially other diseases of the nervous system, and we are currently evaluating forward development paths for these opportunities. Sonnet initiated an ex-US Phase 1b/2a pilot-scale efficacy study with SON-080 in CIPN in July 2022. This study could yield initial top line clinical safety data during the first half of 2023.

SON-080 (Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy)
 
In addition to our CIPN program with SON-080, our DPN program may, subject to data collected from our planned CIPN studies with SON-080, explore the clinical utility of IL-6 in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). DPN is currently diagnosed in 50%-80% of the diabetic patient population. According to World Health Organization (WHO) projections, the prevalence of diabetes is estimated to exceed 350 million people in 2030. Neuropathy is progressive and develops over the continuum of diabetes. The condition involves intractable pain with no obvious origin, as well as non-pain-related symptoms such as loss of balance, lack of sensation and autonomic dysfunctions, among others. These deficits impair quality of life and lead to a reduction of life expectancy. Diabetic foot ulcers are a major cost associated with diabetic medical care and are also directly linked to the development of DPN.
 
Notwithstanding the seriousness of the condition, current treatments only address the pain component of DPN, leaving disease progression and non-pain-related symptoms unaddressed. Furthermore, the few drugs currently used to reduce pain (i.e. Cymbalta, Lyrica, cannabinoids, opioids) are only partially efficacious and are associated with major side effects, which typically delays their introduction into a patient’s care. For these reasons, DPN remains a substantial unmet medical need with high commercial market potential.
 
Exercise has long been recognized by WHO and caregivers as an effective means of treating and potentially preventing diabetes and several pilot studies have provided evidence to support its role in improving DPN. However, a majority of diabetic patients are physically unable to perform exercise. Regular exercise is known to improve diabetes-associated markers (HbA1c, glucose homeostasis), to ameliorate heart rate variability and to stimulate recovery of both nerve function and blood flow. Recent evidence demonstrates that IL-6 is released during exercise and mediates some of the beneficial effects of physical activity. Sonnet has completed preclinical work in animal models of DPN in which exogenous administration of IL-6 exhibited restorative activity in epidermal nerve density, nerve function, blood flow and reactions to painful or disturbing stimuli. In this context, IL-6 may become a future pivotal disease-modifying therapy for the treatment of DPN.
 
In vitro data on oligodendrocytes or organotypic cultures have shown that IL-6 potentially induces myelin gene expression by Schwann cells or oligodendrocytes (Figure 8).

The neuroprotective activity of IL-6 has been evaluated in various paradigms, including excitotoxicity. As well as protecting neurons, IL-6 potentially promotes axonal regeneration and restoration of functional synapses (Figure 9).

Axonal regeneration activity across the lesion (C) and functional recovery (D) of suppressed (A) excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP).
 
Hakkoum et al, J Neurochem 100 (2007) 747-757.
 
The activity of IL-6 in preclinical models of DPN has been evaluated by three independent laboratories. This work has shown that IL-6 exhibits positive activity in neuropathy in a dose-dependent manner and may also help restore normal physiological parameters after neuropathy is well established (i.e. four weeks after the induction of diabetes and consequential neuropathy). The beneficial activity is observed on motor (Figure 10-A) and sensory (Figure 10-B) nerve function (conduction velocity), and behaviorally by measuring thermal (Figure 10-C) and tactile (Figure 10-D) perceptions. In addition to the direct effects on myelin and axons previously observed in vitro, IL-6 has also been observed to have activity in restoring microvascular blood flow in the nerve (Figure 10-E), which is a major driver of diabetic neuropathies. Histological analyses of nerves in animals receiving preventive treatment with IL-6 during the development of neuropathy suggest that IL-6 exhibits protective activity on myelin and may play a role in preserving nerve fiber integrity, as well as nerve conduction velocity and the perception of sensations.

Outside of oncology, 15 pilot studies totaling 167 subjects, including 27 patients with type 2 diabetes, were conducted by independent academic groups not affiliated with Sonnet to evaluate the role of IL-6 in exercise and metabolism. The peer-reviewed results suggest that low dose IL-6 mimics several beneficial aspects of exercise, including expression of anti-inflammatory molecules, increased lipid metabolism, decreased insulin secretion and activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway in muscle.
 
We believe these data provide strong support for the clinical development of IL-6 in DPN. Through its mechanism of action and potential disease modifying activity, low dose IL-6 may offer a therapeutic solution for neuropathic symptoms, as well as for cardiac autonomic neuropathies (CAN), in diabetic patients. We intend to use data collected from our CIPN studies with SON-080 to inform our decision about potential next development steps for SON-080 in DPN. Pursuant to the license agreement the Company entered with New Life Therapeutics Pte., Ltd of Singapore in May 2021, we and New Life will be jointly responsible for developing SON-080 in DPN with the objective of initiating an ex-US pilot efficacy study in the second half of 2023.
 
SON-080: New Life Therapeutics Agreement
 
In May 2021, we announced the execution of a license agreement, described in detail below (the “New Life Agreement”) which resulted in the out-license of our IL-6 (SON-080) asset for DPN to New Life Therapeutics Pte., Ltd (“New Life”) of Singapore. The licensed territory includes the 10 ASEAN countries of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, The Philippines, Cambodia, Brunei, Vietnam, Myanmar and Lao PDR. In June and July of 2021, we amended the New Life Agreement to make Sonnet BioTherapeutics CH SA (rather than Sonnet BioTherapeutics, Inc.) the party to the New Life Agreement (First Amendment) and we also made Sonnet BioTherapeutics, Inc. the Guarantor of performance under the New Life Agreement (Second Amendment), respectively. In addition to the initial $500,000 received by Sonnet upon signing of the LOI in August 2020, an additional $500,000 non-refundable upfront payment was received by Sonnet upon execution of the New Life Agreement. According to the terms of the New Life Agreement, Sonnet could receive a $1 million deferred license fee within 30 days of the achievement of an early commercial sales milestone, a total of up to $19 million in milestone payments and a tiered royalty ranging from 12% to 30% on commercial sales.
 
Sonnet and New Life intend to initiate an ex-US pilot-scale efficacy study in DPN in the second half of 2023.

SON-1210
 
SON-1210, our lead bispecific construct, combines IL-12 and IL-15 conjugated to FHAB. These cytokines were selected based on synergistic biologic activity.
 
IL-15 acts through its specific receptor, IL15Rα, which is expressed on antigen-presenting dendritic cells (APC), monocytes and macrophages. In addition to the potential antitumor properties of IL-12 described above, we believe IL-15 can potentially add the following complementary activity:
 

● | Induce differentiation and proliferation of T, B and natural killer (NK) cells 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Enhance cytolytic activity of CD8+ T cells 
● | Induce long-lasting CD8+ memory T cells enhancing immune surveillance against cancer for month/years 
● | Stimulates differentiation and immunoglobulin synthesis by B cells 
● | Induce maturation of dendritic cells 
● | Up regulate IL-12b1 receptor expression 

 
Summary of the reciprocal biologic activity of Interleukins 12 and 15:
 

● | IL12: Increases IL15Rα receptor, IFNɣ, NK/T cells, TH1 (tumor killing) and decreases Treg 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | IL15: Increases IL12β 1 receptor, NK cells, CD8 memory and decreases apoptosis 

 

Figure 11: These data suggest an enhanced reduction in tumor growth with SON-1210 compared to concomitantly administered, naked IL-12 and IL-15 in a mouse model of melanoma.
 

Figure 12: The combination of IL-12 and IL-15 with FHAB displayed synergistic activity, leading to improved tumor volume reduction versus IL12-FHAB alone in a mouse model of melanoma. 
 
A non-human primate (NHP) non-GLP dose escalation study was completed in September 2022, and a GLP repeat dose NHP study has also been completed in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022. cGMP manufacturing for bulk drug is completed, and a lyophilized formulation of drug product will be manufactured in early 2023, to support the First-In-Human (FIH) clinical study. The initial tox material supported the non-GLP study, while the GLP study is being performed on the same lot of GMP drug as intended for the FIH clinical study. The regulatory authorization process for SON-1210 is scheduled to commence during the first half of 2023.
 
The in-life portion of a non-human primate (NHP) study is on track to be completed in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022, with initiation of the regulatory authorization process to commence during the first half of 2023. Manufacturing and drug supply are secured with a lyophilized drug product formulation being prepared during the first calendar quarter of 2023, which is expected to be suitable for first-in-human clinical trials.

Discovery Assets: SON-1410 (IL18-FHAB-IL12) and SON-3015 (Anti IL6-FHAB-Anti TGFβ)
 
In August 2021, we announced the selection of a novel development candidate after completing comparative studies in a mouse melanoma model. The candidate represents Sonnet’s second bispecific compound integrating Interleukin 12 (IL-12) with the company’s Fully Human Albumin Binding (FHAB) platform. The target indications for SON-1410 will be melanoma and renal cancers.
 
IL18-FHAB-IL12 showed statistically significant tumor size reduction in a mouse melanoma study compared with the placebo, as well as a dose response. The data demonstrated:
 

Compound | Day 0, Single Dose Tumor @ 100 mm3 | Day 8 Tumor Volume (mm3 +/- SEM), N=8 | Day 8 Percentage Tumor Shrinkage | 
---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+---
Placebo | NA | 1747 +/- 301 | | - | 
IL18-FHAB-IL12 | 1 µg | 918 +/- 130 | | 47 | %
IL18-FHAB-IL12 | 5 µg | 619 +/- 141 | | 65 | %

 
A separate mouse study was also performed comparing the selected version of IL18-FHAB-IL12 with two other candidates, GMCSF-FHAB-IL18 and GMCSF-FHAB-IL12. The comparison data indicated significantly greater reduction in tumor volume, along with higher Interferon Gamma levels and immune cell responses (NK, NKT, Th1, and cytotoxic CD8 T cells) using IL18-FHAB-IL12, compared with GMCSF-FHAB-IL12 or GMCSF-FHAB-IL18.
 
Cell line development activities are being initiated for SON-1410, followed by process development, formulation development and scale-up manufacturing. Development activities for the compound are ongoing, with the potential to generate drug suitable for initial in vivo mouse studies by the end of the 2023 calendar year.
 
TGF-β1/IL-6 biology is a strong predictor of overall survival in cancer, and the combined targeting of IL-6 and TGF-β1 signaling using SON-3015 may represent a promising strategy for treating tumor and bone metastases. TGFβ is released from degraded bone, and enhances IL-6 production, contributing to the vicious circle of bone metastasis. High FcRn expression in the bone environment would result in accumulation in the bone of the dual construct anti IL6- FHAB-anti TGFβ, thereby potentially inhibiting or blocking bone metastases. Sonnet has elected to place the SON-3015 development program on hold for expense reduction purposes.

We face numerous challenges and uncertainties with respect to the development and commercialization of our therapeutic compounds, including our FHAB technology. Please see “Risk Factors” contained elsewhere in this prospectus, and the sections entitled “Risk Factors” in the documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus.
 
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of cancer immunotherapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with new immunotherapies that may become available in the future.
 
We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that develop immuno-oncology treatments. There are many other companies that have commercialized and/or are developing immuno-oncology treatments for cancer including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as Amgen, AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer and Roche/Genentech.
 
We face significant competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that target the use of specific cytokines or other large molecules as immunomodulating therapies in the cancer setting. These generally include, single- or bi-specific antibodies, fusion proteins, antibody drug conjugates and targeted vaccines.
 
With respect to our lead product candidate, SON-080, we are aware of other companies developing products to treat CIPN, including but not limited to Apexian Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Aphios Corporation, Asahi Kasei Corporation, MundiPharma EDO and Regenacy Pharmaceuticals, Inc; however, we believe we are the only company studying the use of a disease-modifying cytokine for the indication.
 
With respect to our first FHAB-derived candidate, SON-1010, we are aware of other competing IL-12 programs, which include, but are not limited to those being developed by Celsion Corporation, Eli Lilly, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Intrexon Corporation, Codiak Biosciences, Xiolio Therapeutics, Werewolf Therapeutics, Dragonfly Therapeutics and OncoSec Medical. We believe that our FHAB integrated IL-12 is tumor-targeted with an enhanced pK profile that differentiates it from the competition.
 
With respect to our earlier stage pipeline FHAB product candidates SON-1210, SON-2014 and SON-3105, we are not aware of any other competing companies working on these specific bi-specific programs.
 
Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics, if required, the level of biosimilar or generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.

Manufacturing
 
We rely on contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, to produce our drug candidates in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations for use in our clinical trials. The manufacture of biopharmaceuticals is subject to extensive cGMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control. Our pipeline molecules are manufactured using the standard industrial Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) platform with common bio-chemical engineering from readily available raw materials.
 
To meet our projected needs for clinical supplies to support our activities through regulatory approval and commercial manufacturing, the CDMOs with whom we currently work will need to increase the scale of production, or we will need to secure alternate suppliers. We believe that our current CDMO has the wherewith-all and interest, to add capacity as required. The landscape for CDMOs is strong and there are multiple potential sources for contract manufacturing. We have not yet engaged alternate suppliers in the event that our current CDMOs are unable to scale production, however we have engaged our existing CDMO in expansion conversations. Our relationships with CDMOs are managed by internal personnel with extensive experience in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing.
 
If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of drug candidates or receive raw materials in a timely manner, we could be required to delay our ongoing clinical trials and seek alternative manufacturers, which would be costly and time-consuming.
 
License and Other Commercial Arrangements
 
Janssen Pharmaceuticals (Johnson & Johnson)
 
In October 2022, Sonnet announced a collaboration agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, where in vitro and in vivo efficacy of SON-1010 (IL12-FHAB), SON-1210 (IL12-FHAB-IL15) and SON-1410 (IL18-FHAB-IL12) will be evaluated in combination with certain Janssen proprietary cell therapy assets. The agreement was facilitated by Johnson & Johnson Innovation. Under the terms of the agreement, Sonnet shall supply the three referenced compounds for use in head-to-head in vitro and in vivo efficacy studies. If successful and subject to provisions of the agreement, Janssen could exercise its option and Sonnet could then seek an expanded collaboration.
New Life
 
In May 2021, the Company entered into a License Agreement (the “New Life Agreement”) with New Life Therapeutics PTE, LTD (“New Life”). Under the New Life Agreement, the Company granted New Life an exclusive license (with the right to sublicense) to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical preparations containing a specific recombinant human interleukin-6, SON-080 (the “Compound”) (such preparations, the “Products”) for the prevention, treatment or palliation of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in humans (the “DPN Field”) in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Myanmar, Lao PDR and Cambodia (the “Exclusive Territory”). New Life may exercise an option to expand (1) the field of the exclusive license to include the prevention, treatment or palliation of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in humans (the “CIPN Field”), which option is non-exclusive and will expire on December 31, 2021; and/or (2) the territorial scope of the license to include the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong and/or India, which option is exclusive and will also expire on December 31, 2021. If these options are exercised, the terms of the CIPN Field and the territory expansion will be negotiated by the parties. In June and July of 2021, we amended the New Life Agreement to make Sonnet BioTherapeutics CH SA (rather than Sonnet BioTherapeutics, Inc.) the party to the New Life Agreement (First Amendment) and we also made Sonnet BioTherapeutics, Inc. the Guarantor of performance under the New Life Agreement (Second Amendment), respectively.
 
The Company will retain all rights to manufacture Compounds and Products anywhere in the world. The Company and New Life shall enter into a follow-on supply agreement pursuant to which the Company shall supply to New Life Products for development and commercialization thereof in the DPN Field (and the CIPN Field, if applicable) in the Exclusive Territory on terms to be negotiated by the parties. The Company will also assist in transferring certain preclinical and clinical development know-how that is instrumental in New Life’s ability to benefit from the license.

New Life will bear the cost of, and be responsible for, among other things, conducting clinical studies and additional non-clinical studies and other developmental and regulatory activities for and commercializing Products in the DPN Field (and the CIPN Field, if applicable) in the Exclusive Territory.
 
New Life paid the Company a $0.5 million non-refundable upfront cash payment in August 2020 upon executing a letter of intent to negotiate a license agreement and a $0.5 million non-refundable upfront cash payment in June 2021 in connection with the execution of the New Life Agreement. New Life is also obligated to pay a non-refundable deferred license fee of an additional $1.0 million at the time of the satisfaction of certain milestones, as well as potential additional milestone payments to the Company of up to $19.0 million subject to the achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones. In addition, during the Royalty Term (as defined below), New Life is obligated to pay the Company tiered double digit royalties ranging from 12% to 30% based on annual net sales of Products in the Exclusive Territory. The “Royalty Term” means, on a Product-by-Product and a country-by-country basis in the Exclusive Territory, the period commencing on the date of the first commercial sale (subject to certain conditions) of such Product in such country in the Exclusive Territory and continuing until New Life ceases commercialization of such Product in the DPN Field (or CIPN Field, if applicable).
 
The New Life Agreement will remain in effect on a Product-by-Product, country-by-country basis and will expire upon the expiration of the Royalty Term for the last-to-expire Product in the last-to-expire country, subject to (i) each party’s early termination rights including for material breach or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party and (ii) the Company’s Buy Back Right and New Life’s Give Back Right (as defined below).
 
In addition, New Life granted to the Company an exclusive option to buy back the rights granted by the Company to New Life and the Company granted New Life the right to give back the rights with respect to Products in the DPN Field and/or the CIPN Field (if applicable) in one or more countries in the Exclusive Territory on terms to be agreed upon, which options will expire upon the initiation of a Phase III Trial for the applicable Product.
 
XOMA
 
Sonnet (as successor-in-interest to Oncobiologics, Inc. (“Oncobiologics”), after Oncobiologics spun-off certain assets into Sonnet and concurrently distributed all of its shares in Sonnet on a pro rata basis to Oncobiologics’s stockholders on April 6, 2015) and XOMA (US) LLC (“XOMA”) are party to a Discovery Collaboration Agreement, dated July 23, 2012 and an Amendment of Discovery Collaboration Agreement, dated May 7, 2019 (together, the “Collaboration Agreement”) pursuant to which XOMA granted to Sonnet a non-exclusive, non-transferrable license and/or right to use certain materials, technologies and related information related to discovery, optimization and development of antibodies and related proteins and to develop and commercialize products thereunder (each, a “Product”). Sonnet is obligated to make contingent milestone payments to XOMA totaling $3.75 million on a Product-by-Product basis upon the achievement of certain development and approval milestones related to a Product. Sonnet has also agreed to pay XOMA low single-digit royalties on net sales of Products sold by Sonnet. Royalties on each Product are payable on a country-by-country basis until the later of (i) a specified period of time after the First Commercial Sale (as defined in the Collaboration Agreement), and (ii) the date of expiration of the last valid claim in the last-to-expire of the issued patents covered by the Collaboration Agreement. In addition, Sonnet has the right to reduce the rate of the royalty on a Product-by-Product basis by paying XOMA a specified amount. The Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by either party for cause and contains customary indemnification provisions.
ARES
 
On August 28, 2015, Relief, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Sonnet, signed a License Agreement (the “ARES License Agreement”) with Ares Trading, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck KGaA (“ARES”). Under the terms of the ARES License Agreement, ARES has granted the Company a sublicensable, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license on proprietary patents to research, develop, use and commercialize products (each, a “Product”) using atexakin alfa (“Atexakin”), a low dose formulation of human interleukin-6 in peripheral neuropathies and vascular complications. Three patents are included in the ARES License Agreement that protect the use of Atexakin to treat i) diabetic neuropathy, ii) chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and iii) vascular complications.

----

 

Pursuant to the ARES License Agreement, we will pay ARES high single-digit royalties on net sales of Products sold by the Company. Royalties are payable on a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis until the later of (i) a specified period of time after the First Commercial Sale (as defined in the ARES License Agreement) in such country, and (ii) the last date on which such product is covered by a valid claim in such country. If a Product is not covered by a valid claim in a country or such valid claim has expired or been invalidated before the twelfth (12th) anniversary of the date of the First Commercial Sale of such Product in such country, then the royalty rate will be reduced by fifty percent (50%). We will also pay ARES a sublicensing fee that is a percentage of the proceeds received from a sublicensing event (“Sublicensing Receipts”) using a sliding scale (which percentage decreases at later stages of clinical development at which the sublicensing event occurs) that starts in the low double digits and decreases to the high single digits. The ARES License Agreement may be terminated by the Company for convenience at any time or by either party upon a breach by the other party. The License agreement contains customary indemnification provisions.
 
The Ares License Agreement was amended effective November 1, 2021, in order to clarify the application of some of the terms and conditions contained therein related to sublicensing. In particular:
 

● | Sonnet is now authorized to grant sublicenses to third parties without the prior written consent of ARES, providing that the financial condition of any such sublicenses reflects fair market value as determined by Sonnet in good faith. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Because the initial conditions by which Sonnet would remunerate ARES out of Sublicensing Receipts were unclear, the ARES License Agreement was clarified such that Sonnet will now have to pay ARES a percentage of all Sublicensing Receipts in case the relevant sublicense agreement is signed before or after completion of the first Phase I clinical trial (as opposed to payment only in case the relevant sublicense agreement is signed after completion of the first Phase I clinical trial, as was set in the original ARES License Agreement). 
● | It was agreed that the foregoing clarification would only apply to future sublicensing agreements, and with respect to the royalties (but not the milestone payments) that may be generated from the New Life Agreement. 

Intellectual Property
 
With respect to our patent portfolio, we have two issued patents (U.S. and Japan), and we have filed patent applications directed to numerous fusion proteins that include the Fully Human Albumin Binding domain (FHAB). If granted, the resulting patents would expire on dates ranging from 2038 to 2041, subject to patent term extensions under certain circumstances. The patent application filings include:
 
● National filings corresponding to WO/2018/151868 - This application is directed to fully human “Albumin Binding Domain (FHAB) Fusion Proteins”, including fusion proteins with scFv’s (e.g., anti-TGFβ, PD-L1, TNF, IL1, IL6, IL8, etc.), fusion proteins with cytokines (e.g., IL2-FHAB, IL12-FHAB, IL15-FHAB, IL7-FHAB, etc.) and combinations of two cytokines, such as IL12-FHAB-IL15, GMcSF-FHAB-IL18, and IL18-FHAB-IL12; and methods of treatments using such FHAB fusion proteins.

◌ A U.S. patent application (U.S. 15/932,387) and a PCT patent application (PCT/US2018/00085), titled “Albumin Binding Domain Fusion Proteins” originally received an application filing date of February 20, 2018, which is four days after the one-year anniversary of the filing date of U.S. provisional patent applications U.S. 62/459,975 and U.S. 62/459,981 to which both the U.S. patent application and the PCT patent application claim a priority benefit. A request to restore the priority benefit to the filing date of U.S. provisional patent applications U.S. 62/459,975 and U.S. 62/459,981 was granted for the U.S. patent application and PCT patent application. Subsequently, national phase patent applications were filed from the PCT patent application in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, New Zealand and Russia. However, due to differences in the patent laws in these jurisdictions, the priority claims to U.S. 62/459,975 and U.S. 62/459,981 have thus far only been accepted in Australia, Europe, India, Japan, New Zealand, and Russia.
 
● US provisional application directed to anti-IL6-FHAB fusion proteins, including anti-IL6-FHAB, anti-IL6-FHAB-anti-TGFβ, and anti-IL6-FHAB-anti-IL8 fusion proteins; and methods of treatments using such fusion proteins was re-filed as US 63/245,702 on September 22, 2021. Due in large part to scientific challenges, the supportive data was not obtained within the one-year period after filing the provisional patent, and therefore, the patent was abandoned. However, recent technical breakthroughs will allow this abandoned patent to be re-filed in 2023.
 
● US provisional application directed to Antigen/Albumin Binding Domain Conjugates, and methods of treatments using such conjugates was re-filed as US 63/187,278 on May 11, 2021. Data in support of the provisional patent claims was not generated, and therefore, this patent was abandoned.
 
● US provisional application directed to Method of Treating Age-Related Frailty with Low-Dose IL6 filed June 4, 2021, as Application no. 63/197,097 and converted to a PCT patent in June 2022.

With respect to our trademark portfolio, we received international registrational approval with the World Intellectual Property Office (WIPO) for the Sonnet BioTherapeutics and FHAB marks, each having an Effective Date of Sept. 17, 2020. Further, both marks were published by the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), having Effective Dates of Nov. 30, 2020 and Dec. 6, 2020, respectively. In 2021, the USPTO issued Notices of Allowance for both marks, indicating that both applications have successfully completed the opposition period and have matured to registration with the submission acceptable Statements of Use. To that end, the USPTO issued a Notice of Allowance of the Statement of Use for each of the Sonnet BioTherapeutics and FHAB applications and we expect to receive the Certificates of Registration shortly.
 
● The Switzerland Trademark Office granted protection to the Sonnet BioTherapeutics and FHAB marks on Sept. 14, 2021, and Oct. 26, 2021, respectively, and are protected under International Trademark Registration nos. 1558330 and 1558471.
 
● The Canadian Intellectual Property Office granted protection to the Sonnet BioTherapeutics mark on June 8, 2022 and is protected under International Trademark Registration no. 1558330 while the FHAB mark is protected under International Trademark Registration no. 15584471, for which the 18-month opposition period began on Nov. 16, 2022.

● In addition to Switzerland and Canada, the Sonnet BioTherapeutics mark was also granted protection in Australia, European Union, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and the United Kingdom, in each case having a Registration no. of 1558330, an Effective Registration date of Sept. 17, 2020 and a renewal date of Sept. 17, 2030. Likewise, the FHAB mark was granted protection in Australia, China, European Union, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and the United Kingdom, in each case having a Registration no. of 1558471, a Granted Protection Date of Sept. 17, 2020 and renewal date of Sept. 17, 2030.
 
● Although the Sonnet BioTherapeutics mark was initially rejected in China due to potential non-use claims directed to certain competing companies, our law firm is quite confident that since the initial Class 42 rejection was successfully cancelled, two new trademark applications for this same mark were also registered and/or published in 2021 could also be overcome; however, we won’t be able to initiate non-use cancellation filings against these marks until 2025, which is the anticipated timeframe by which these pending class 42 applications are likely to become registered in China.
 
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2022, we had 12 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and other third parties to assist with various aspects of its business.
Government Regulation
 
The research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, including biological products, are extensively regulated by government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries and jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions also regulate the pricing of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
Licensure and Regulation of Biologics in the United States
 
In the United States, biological products, or biologics, are regulated under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and their implementing regulations. The failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process may subject an applicant to delays in the conduct of a study, regulatory review and approval, and/or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions may include, without limitation, the FDA’s refusal to allow an applicant to proceed with clinical testing, refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, product recalls, product seizures, suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, investigations and civil and criminal penalties. Biological product candidates must be granted a biological license by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States.
 

-23-
----

 

The process required by the FDA to obtain a biological license in the United States generally involves the following:
 
● Completion of extensive nonclinical, or preclinical, laboratory tests and preclinical animal trials and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including good laboratory practices, or GLPs;
 
● Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application prior to initiation of any human clinical trials. Permission to proceed must be received before the beginning of such trials;
 
● Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with the FDA’s regulation generally referred to as the good clinical practices, or GCP and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on biological product candidate at any time before or during our clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA;
 
● Preparation and submission to the FDA of a Biologic License Application, or BLA, for a biologic product requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications, including submission of detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product in clinical development and proposed labeling;
 
● Review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, as determined by the FDA review division;
 
● Satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 
● Satisfactory completion of one or more FDA audits of the clinical study sites to assure compliance with GCPs, and the integrity of clinical data in support of the BLA;
 
● Payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the BLA and licensure of the new biologic product;
 
● Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and any post-approval studies required by the FDA.
 
Nonclinical Studies and Investigational New Drug Application
 
Each product candidate must undergo nonclinical testing before testing in humans. These tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to evaluate the potential for activity and toxicity and must be conducted in compliance with applicable regulations. The results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the product or conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before the clinical trial can begin.
 
Submission of the IND may result in the FDA not allowing the trial to commence or on the terms originally specified by the sponsor in the IND. If the FDA raises concerns or questions, it may choose to impose clinical holds on biological product candidates at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and only under terms authorized by the FDA.

Human Clinical Trials in Support of a BLA
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients with the disease to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator in accordance with GCP requirements. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of the BLA so long as the clinical trial is well-designed and well-conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, and the FDA is able to validate the study data through an onsite inspection, if necessary.
 
Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board, or IRB, either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted or, for trials conducted outside of the United States, by an independent ethics committee referred to above. The IRB will consider, among other things, clinical trial design, patient informed consent, ethical factors and the safety of human subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. The FDA, IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP rules and the requirements for informed consent. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group may recommend continuation of the study as planned, changes in study conduct, or cessation of the study at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study.
 
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may be required after approval.
 
● Phase 1: the biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients, such as cancer patients.
 
● Phase 2: the biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, preliminary evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
 
● Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population and geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide adequate basis for product labelling.
 
● Phase 4: post-approval clinical trials, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. They provide additional experience for the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. If the FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase 4 clinical trial requirement or to request a change in the product labeling. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
 
Compliance with cGMP Requirements
 
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility(ies) where the product is manufactured to ensure full compliance of the manufacturing processes and facilities with cGMP requirements and consistent production with required specifications. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of products must also register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Any product manufactured by or imported from a facility that has not registered is deemed misbranded under the FDCA. Establishments may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by government authorities. Manufacturers may have to provide records regarding their establishments.

Review and Approval of a BLA
 
Results of product candidate development, nonclinical testing and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting a license to market the product. The BLA must contain extensive and detailed information on the manufacturing and composition of the product and proposed labeling as well as payment of a user fee. The FDA has 60 days after submission of the application to conduct an initial review to determine whether the BLA is sufficient to accept for filing. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins its in-depth review. The FDA has twelve months in which to complete its initial review of a standard application (or six months for a priority review) and respond to the applicant. The FDA does not always meet its goal dates and the review process may be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The review process and the goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or if the applicant otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the goal date.
 
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, the FDA may issue an approval letter, denial letter, or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. Under the PHSA, the FDA may approve a BLA if it determines that the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility where the product will be manufactured meets standards designed to ensure that it continues to be safe, pure and potent. If the application is not approved, the FDA may issue a complete response letter, which will contain the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application, and when possible, will outline recommended actions the sponsor might take to obtain approval of the application. Sponsors that receive a complete response letter may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA. Such resubmissions are classified under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as either Class 1 or Class 2, based on the information submitted by an applicant in response to an action letter. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has two months to review a Class 1 resubmission and six months to review a Class 2 resubmission. The FDA will not approve an application until issues identified in the complete response letter have been addressed. The FDA issues a denial letter if it determines that the establishment or product does not meet the agency’s requirements.
 
The FDA may also refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and non-binding recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. In particular, the FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee.
 
If the FDA approves a new product, the FDA may limit its approved indications for use as well as require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may call for post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess the product’s safety after approval. The FDA may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations
 
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as (i) fast track designation, (ii) breakthrough therapy designation and (iii) priority review designation.

-26-
----

 

● Fast Track Review: The FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended (alone or in combination with one or more other products) for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. Sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s application before the application is complete. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. Fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA.
 
● Breakthrough Therapy: A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy and be eligible for expedited review if it is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies.
 
● Priority Review: The FDA may designate a product for priority review if such product treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness when compared with other available therapies. This assessment is made by the FDA on a case-by-case basis. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from 10 to six months.
 
Accelerated Approval Pathway
 
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 
For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on IMM. The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
 
The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

Post-Approval Regulation
 
Even if regulatory approval is granted, a marketed product is subject to continuing comprehensive requirements under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, including requirements and restrictions regarding adverse event reporting, recordkeeping, marketing, and compliance with cGMP. Adverse events reported after approval of a drug can result in additional restrictions on the use of a marketed product or requirements for additional post-marketing studies or clinical trials.
 
Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects and reporting updated safety and efficacy information.
 
Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements relating to the manufacturer or promotion of an approved product may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as significant administrative, civil or criminal sanctions.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 
Orphan drug designation in the United States is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the product for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
 
Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for tax credits and market exclusivity for seven years following the date of the product’s marketing approval if granted by the FDA. An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. A product may be designated as an orphan drug by the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development, or OOPD, based on an acceptable application. The product must then go through the review and approval process like any other product. Orphan drug designations may be revoked based on a change in the incidence of the disease.
 
A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved product or a new orphan indication for an already marketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek and obtain orphan drug designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition if it can present a plausible hypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first drug. More than one sponsor may receive orphan drug designation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking orphan drug designation must file a complete request for designation.
 
The period of exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA and applies only to the indication for which the product has been designated. The FDA may approve a second application for the same product for a different use or a second application for a clinically superior version of the product for the same use. The FDA cannot, however, approve the same product made by another manufacturer for the same indication during the market exclusivity period unless it has the consent of the sponsor or the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities.

Pediatric Research
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain applications for approval must include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug in relevant pediatric populations. The FDA may waive or defer the requirement for a pediatric assessment, either at the company’s request or by the FDA’s initiative. The FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy are necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks. REMS may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, depending on what the FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug. Sponsors are required to submit an initial pediatric study plan to their IND after their end-of-phase 2 meeting with the FDA
Regulation and Procedures Governing Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company also must comply with numerous regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can initiate clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions.
Clinical Trial Approval
 
Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the Member States. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted or in multiple Member States if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of Member States. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the independent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application, or CTA, must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and corresponding national laws of the Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 
In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation will apply in 2019 or 2020. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the European Union. Specifically, the new regulation, which will be directly applicable in all Member States, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. For instance, the new Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure using a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
 
Marketing Authorization
 
To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under the European Union regulatory system, an applicant must submit an MAA, either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in European Union Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure, or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. An applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
 
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union Member States. It is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.
 

-29-
----

 

Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the assessment of a product to define its risk/benefit profile. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation.
 
Periods of Authorization and Renewals
 
A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing Member State. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. Any authorization that is not followed by the placement of the drug on the European Union market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid.
 
Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization
 
Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include compliance with the European Union’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. In addition, the manufacturing of authorized products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the EMA’s GMP requirements and comparable requirements of other regulatory bodies in the European Union, which mandate the methods, facilities and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. Finally, the marketing and promotion of authorized products, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 
Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the drug has to be of significant benefit compared to products available for the condition. An orphan drug designation provides benefits such as fee reductions, regulatory assistance and the possibility to apply for a centralized European Union marketing authorization. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. The market exclusivity period may however be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation.
Combination Products in the United States
 
Certain products, the combination products, may be comprised of components that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities and frequently by different centers at the FDA. A combination product may be (i) a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; (ii) two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; (iii) drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, or device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or (iv) any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect. The FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product, this determination being based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Sponsors may request a jurisdiction determination by submitting a Request for Designation to the office of Combination Drug Products.
