Item 1. Business
Overview 
 We are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing and marketing drugs globally to treat patients with rare and serious diseases. We are bringing novel and transformative medicines to patients by driving clinical program execution, understanding patient and physician needs, preparing the market, creating market access, and commercializing our products on a global basis. As an affiliate of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, we have a robust portfolio of development-, registration- and commercial-stage drugs covering multiple targets and diseases using antisense therapeutics. Our immediate focus is on the commercial launch of our first commercially approved therapy, TEGSEDI in the United States, or U.S., the European Union, or E.U., and Canada. TEGSEDI treats the polyneuropathy caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis, in adults. We estimate that there are approximately 50,000 patients globally with hATTR amyloidosis, the majority of whom have symptoms of polyneuropathy. We are also focused on commercial preparations for WAYLIVRA in the E.U. and on regulatory discussions for WAYLIVRA in the U.S. and Canada. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization of WAYLIVRA as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, who are at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. The positive opinion will now be referred to the EC, which grants marketing authorization for medicines in the European Union, as well as to European Economic Area members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. With this positive opinion, and, pending adoption of the positive opinion by the EC, we plan to leverage our existing commercial infrastructure in Europe to market WAYLIVRA. FCS is an ultra-rare, devastating hereditary disease that causes unpredictable and potentially fatal acute pancreatitis, chronic complications due to permanent organ damage, and a severe impact on daily living. The hallmark of FCS is extremely elevated triglycerides. There are approximately 3,000 to 5,000 patients with FCS worldwide. We are advancing a mature pipeline of novel drugs with the potential to treat multiple diseases. TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA and our pipeline drugs, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-TTR-LRx, are all based on Ionis’ antisense technology platform.  Our pipeline drugs use Ionis' advanced Ligand Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, technology, which enhances the effective uptake and activity of these drugs in particular tissues.
 TEGSEDI is the world’s first subcutaneous, RNA-targeted therapeutic that substantially reduces the production of transthyretin, or TTR protein. Importantly, TEGSEDI is Akcea’s first commercially approved drug, and our launch is underway in three regions: the U.S., the E.U. and Canada. We continue to work toward our goal to make TEGSEDI available to people globally. 
 We are continuing to build our commercial infrastructure to support TEGSEDI, and plan to use this infrastructure to support WAYLIVRA and the other drugs in our pipeline, if approved in the future as we anticipate further commercialization in serious and rare diseases. A key element of our commercial strategy is to provide the specialized, patient-centric support required to successfully address rare disease patient populations. We believe our focus on treating patients with inadequately addressed rare and serious diseases will allow us to partner efficiently and effectively with the specialized medical community that supports these underserved patient communities. For example, at approval we launched Akcea ConnectTM, a drug treatment program made up of dedicated, regionally-based nurse case managers who have a wide range of medical knowledge and experience, in the United States. This program offers free, private and personalized support to patients and their caregivers and families across the country. Internationally, Akcea Connect is being rolled out in each of the countries where we launch with what we believe is the highest level of patient and physician support allowed in accordance with local regulations. In addition, in August 2018 we entered into an agreement with Express Scripts’ Accredo to be our specialty pharmacy partner for the distribution of TEGSEDI in the U.S. We chose Express Scripts’ Accredo Health Group, Inc., or Accredo because of their experience supporting the unique needs of rare disease communities and their proven track record for simplifying access to therapy. Accredo has a team of specialty clinicians, pharmacists and over 600 field-based nurses located throughout the U.S. who are augmenting the Akcea Connect team of nurse case managers to provide support and address the needs of the hATTR amyloidosis community. Our supply chain is fully operational in the U.S., E.U. and Canada.  To further support the hATTR amyloidosis community, Akcea and Ambry Genetics Corporation, or Ambry, a Konica Minolta company, launched hATTR Compass™ in the U.S. and Canada, a no-cost, confidential genetic testing and genetic counseling program for people with suspected hATTR amyloidosis. This program is intended to empower people with accurate genetic information, so they can make informed decisions about their healthcare.

As we build Akcea, we continue to execute a strategy for expansion of our business globally. Depending on the geographic region, the number of patients impacted by the diseases we are treating and the regulatory environment of the local countries, in some regions we may choose to build out the commercial infrastructure ourselves, and in other instances, we may choose to partner with another company for commercial sales and distribution. For instance, in August 2018, we entered into a licensing agreement with PTC Therapeutics International Limited, or PTC Therapeutics, to commercialize TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA in Latin America and certain Caribbean countries. Our decision to partner with PTC to accelerate commercial access for patients in Latin America reflects our commitment to bringing TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA to patients as rapidly as possible. PTC has an established rare disease team in Latin America that has experience in patient identification, in physician and patient education and support programs and in efficiently obtaining market access. PTC’s patient-focused approach for rare diseases aligns with our approach, making them a great partner for this region. 
 To maximize the commercial potential of two of the drugs in our pipeline, we initiated a strategic collaboration with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, for the development and commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. In February 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. Novartis is currently preparing to initiate a Phase 3 study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) and elevated levels of lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a). We believe Novartis brings significant resources and expertise to the collaboration that can accelerate our ability to deliver these potential therapies to the large populations of patients who have high cardiovascular risk due to inadequately treated lipid disorders. As part of our collaboration, we received $75.0 million in an upfront option payment, of which we retained $60.0 million and paid $15.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. We also earned a $150.0 million license fee when Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx of which we will pay $75.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. We will pay Ionis the sublicense fee in Akcea common stock. Novartis is now responsible for all future development and commercialization activities for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. We are eligible to receive license fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx from Novartis if and when it meets the development, regulatory and sales milestones specified in our agreement. In connection with Novartis’ exercise of its option to exclusively license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, Akcea and Novartis established a more definitive framework under which they would negotiate the co-commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx between the two companies in selected markets. Included in this framework is an option by which Novartis could solely commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in exchange for Novartis paying Akcea increased commercial milestone payments based on sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. We will share any license fees, milestone payments and royalties equally with Ionis.
 For AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, under our agreement with Novartis, after we complete Phase 2 development and if Novartis exercises its option to license AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, we would receive an additional $150.0 million license fee which we would also share equally with Ionis. If exercised, Novartis would conduct and pay for a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and prior cardiovascular risk. If approved, Novartis would commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx worldwide. Novartis will have 60 days plus additional time that could be required for Hart-Scott-Rodino, or HSR, filing and review following the end-of-Phase 2 meeting to exercise its option for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. As part of the collaboration, we may co-commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in selected markets, on mutually agreed terms and conditions. Similar to AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, we are eligible to receive license fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx from Novartis if and when it meets the development, regulatory and sales milestones specified in our agreement. We will share any license fees, milestone payments and royalties equally with Ionis.
 Our Strategy
 We believe we are on our way to becoming a premier global biotechnology company offering treatments for previously inadequately treated serious and rare diseases. The critical components of our business strategy to achieve this goal include the following:

• | Successfully commercialize TEGSEDI in multiple geographies and WAYLIVRA in the E.U.: We are currently marketing TEGSEDI in the U.S., E.U. and Canada. In addition, we are preparing to market WAYLIVRA in the E.U. pending the EC’s adoption of the positive CHMP opinion. We have built a commercial organization in multiple countries and will continue to assess opportunities to grow in other markets as well. We are providing high touch patient and healthcare provider support through Akcea Connect. This team of dedicated nurse case managers provide reimbursement assistance, injection training and support for routine platelet monitoring, which we believe enables strong integration with treating physicians and should facilitate patient uptake and compliance. We also have partnered with PTC Therapeutics to commercialize TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA in Latin America (LATAM) and certain countries in the Caribbean. We believe our collaboration with PTC is the best way to provide these drugs to patients quickly in these markets. We also believe PTC shares the same patient-focus that we do and will be able to provide the same patient services as appropriate in each of the LATAM countries. Now that TEGSEDI is approved, our aim is to make it available globally and we will continue to assess expanding our own global footprint as well as additional strategic partnerships as we continue to commercialize TEGSEDI.

• | Advance multiple novel clinical-stage drugs to commercialization and further grow our pipeline. We seek to maximize near-term and long-term commercial opportunities through development paths in both orphan and broader patient populations. Our pipeline of antisense drugs currently contains five clinical-stage novel therapies that we plan to develop and commercialize by ourselves or in conjunction with a partner for multiple indications. To sustain our goal of being the premier rare and serious disease company, we also plan to actively replenish our pipeline as our current drugs advance through development. For example, we will have the opportunity to potentially license antisense drugs that Ionis advances to treat rare cardiometabolic and rare inherited metabolic diseases under our right of first negotiation that Ionis granted us. In addition to antisense technology, we are open to other technologies and products where we could potentially leverage our commercial and development expertise in rare diseases.

• | Create value through strategic collaborations, to drive drugs to their fullest potential. We believe that some of our drugs could address diseases with very large patient populations. In these patient populations, large, costly, late-stage clinical development programs, as well as large sales forces, are required to maximize a drug's commercial potential. As a result, in some cases, partnering with a large organization with global scale may be the optimal approach for maximizing the potential of drugs in these indications. As an example, we have a strategic collaboration with Novartis for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. Novartis recently exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and as a result they are responsible for all future clinical development and commercial activities and costs. Novartis is currently planning for a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and initiation activities are underway. If they exercise their right to license AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx they could also provide us with an opportunity to move rapidly to Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome studies, enhancing the commercial potential of that drug as well. We also may co-commercialize these two drugs in selected markets, under terms and conditions that we plan to negotiate with Novartis in the future. We believe Novartis brings significant resources and expertise to the collaboration that can accelerate our ability to deliver these potential therapies to the large populations of patients who have high cardiovascular risk due to inadequately treated lipid disorders.

MARKETED THERAPY
 TEGSEDI
 TEGSEDI is a drug that Ionis discovered and developed using Ionis’ proprietary antisense technology platform. TEGSEDI is designed to reduce the production of transthyretin, or TTR, protein. In patients with hereditary transthyretin, or hATTR, amyloidosis, a severe, rare and fatal genetic disease, both the hereditary and wild-type, or wt, TTR protein builds up as fibrils in tissues, such as the peripheral nerves, heart, gastrointestinal system, eyes, kidneys, central nervous system, thyroid and bone marrow. The presence of TTR fibrils interferes with the normal functions of these tissues. The progressive accumulation of TTR amyloid deposits in these tissues and organs leads to sensory, motor and autonomic dysfunction often having debilitating effects on multiple aspects of a patient’s life and eventually leads to death.
 TEGSEDI is now approved in three markets: the U.S., E.U. and Canada. On October 5, 2018, we received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for TEGSEDI for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults. On October 3, 2018, TEGSEDI was approved by Health Canada for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis. And on July 11, 2018, TEGSEDI received marketing authorization, or MA, approval from the European Commission, or EC, for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis.  We estimate that there are approximately 50,000 patients globally with hATTR amyloidosis, the majority of whom have symptoms of polyneuropathy. TEGSEDI is available in the U.S., Germany and Canada and we continue to work today on making TEGSEDI available to patients across various European countries with the ultimate goal of making TEGSEDI available to patients globally.
 Disease Background 
 hATTR amyloidosis is a rare, progressive, and fatal disease that often affects multiple organs, including the nerves, heart, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. hATTR amyloidosis occurs when misfolded TTR protein deposits throughout the body as amyloid fibrils, disrupting tissue and organ structure and function. The burden of hATTR amyloidosis is high as patients often suffer from progressive neuropathy, cardiac, gastrointestinal and psychosocial symptoms affecting every aspect of their life. Without therapeutic intervention, patient quality of life progressively and rapidly deteriorates, leading to a reduction in ambulation and daily function, and ultimately resulting in premature death. As the disease progresses, many patients are no longer able to work and or are forced to take substantial time off. The impact of the disease is not limited to physical symptoms but also impacts mental health and outlook as patients often live in fear and isolation. An accurate and timely diagnosis and early treatment initiation is critical to optimize disease management.

PIPELINE
 

All products were discovered by Ionis and either developed by Ionis or co-developed by Ionis and Akcea. 
 WAYLIVRA
 WAYLIVRA was discovered by Ionis and is being co-developed by Akcea and Ionis and is based on Ionis’ antisense technology platform. WAYLIVRA is designed to address the serious and unmet medical needs of the underserved FCS patient community. We are focused on commercial preparations for WAYLIVRA in the E.U. and on regulatory discussions for WAYLIVRA in the U.S. and Canada. The CHMP of the EMA has adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization of WAYLIVRA as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed FCS who are at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. The positive opinion will now be referred to the EC, which grants marketing authorization for medicines in the European Union, as well as to European Economic Area members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. With this positive opinion, and, pending adoption of the positive opinion by the EC, we plan to leverage our existing commercial infrastructure in Europe to market WAYLIVRA. In the U.S., on May 10, 2018, the FDA’s Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee voted to support approval of WAYLIVRA for the treatment of people with FCS. On August 27, 2018, we and Ionis announced that we received a Complete Response Letter from the Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products of the FDA regarding the New Drug Application for WAYLIVRA. The FDA did not cite any new concerns beyond those described in the advisory committee briefing book, in which the main areas of focus were the dosing schedule and management of thrombocytopenia, a deficiency of platelets in the blood. In November 2018, we received a Notice of Noncompliance withdrawal letter, or NON-W, from Health Canada for WAYLIVRA. We and Ionis are engaged with the FDA and plan to work with Health Canada to confirm a path forward for WAYLIVRA. 
 FCS is a severe and rare lipid disorder characterized by extremely elevated levels of triglycerides. FCS has life-threatening consequences such as acute pancreatitis and the lives of patients with this disease are impacted daily by the associated symptoms. In our clinical program, we have observed consistent and substantial (>70%) decreases in triglycerides and improvements in other manifestations of FCS, including pancreatitis attacks and abdominal pain. We believe the safety and efficacy data from the WAYLIVRA program demonstrate a favorable risk-benefit profile for patients with FCS. The FDA and EMA have granted orphan drug designation to WAYLIVRA for the treatment of patients with FCS.

WAYLIVRA is also in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL. People with FPL lack subcutaneous adipose tissue and have abnormal subcutaneous fat distribution causing increased incidence of potentially life-threatening pancreatitis, diabetes, extreme insulin resistance and increased liver fat. BROADEN is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 300 mg of WAYLIVRA administered by a subcutaneous injection in patients with FPL. We plan to report results from the BROADEN study this year.
 LICA Pipeline
 The other drugs in our pipeline - AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-TTR-LRx utilize Ionis' advanced Ligand Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, technology. LICA technology conjugates specific chemical structures or molecules to antisense drugs to increase the efficiency of drug uptake in a particular tissue. We believe the enhancements from LICA technology have the potential to allow for less frequent administration and significantly lower doses, providing greater patient convenience. Data from a number of Phase 1 studies and our Phase 2 study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx have shown that doses up to 30-fold lower than non-LICA drugs result in consistent target reductions and a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Our current pipeline includes drugs with the potential to treat patients with ATTR and a wide range of lipid disorders associated with cardiometabolic disease that other technologies, such as small molecules and antibodies, have not been able to adequately address. 
 Our clinical pipeline contains novel drugs with the potential to treat inadequately addressed serious and rare disorders. 
 AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. We are developing AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx for patients who are at significant risk of cardiovascular disease, or CVD, because of their elevated levels of Lp(a). AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx inhibits the production of the apolipoprotein(a), or apo(a), protein, thereby reducing Lp(a). Apo(a) is a form of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, that is very atherogenic (promoting the formation of plaques in the arteries) and very thrombogenic (promoting the formation of blood clots). In September 2018, we reported positive results from the Phase 2 dose-ranging study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with elevated levels of Lp(a) greater than 60 mg/dL, and established CVD. 
 In February 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. Planning and initiation activities are underway for Novartis to run a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with established CVD and elevated levels of lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a). We believe Novartis brings significant resources and expertise to the collaboration that can accelerate our ability to deliver this potential therapy to patients at risk of CVD due to elevated levels of Lp(a). If AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx is approved, Novartis will be responsible for worldwide commercialization. As part of the collaboration, we may co-commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in selected markets, on mutually agreed terms and conditions.
 Novartis’ decision follows positive results from a Phase 2 study in this patient population. The Phase 2 study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and to determine the appropriate dosing for a planned Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study.  The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase 2 study included 286 patients with established CVD and high Lp(a) levels (baseline mean of approximately 100mg/dL [250 nmol/L] - more than three times the upper limit of normal). The trial had five cohorts: 20 mg (every 4 weeks), 40 mg (every 4 weeks), 60 (every 4 weeks), 20 mg (every 2 weeks), and 20 mg (every week). The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change in Lp(a) from baseline at the primary analysis time point (6 months) compared to placebo. The secondary efficacy endpoints were mean percent change in LDL-C, apoB, OxPL-apoB, OxPL-apo(a), and the number of patients reaching pre-specific thresholds of Lp(a) reduction of <125 nmol/L (<50 mg/dL) or <75 nmol/L (<30 mg/dL). Patients were treated with AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx or placebo for at least six months, with some patients treated up to one year. The study met all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints analyzed at 6 months. Results from the study show statistically significant and dose dependent reductions from baseline in Lp(a) levels:
 
 
Lp(a) | Pooled placebo (n=47) | 20 mg every 4 weeks (n=48) | 40 mg every 4 weeks (n=48) | 20 mg every 2 weeks (n=48) | 60 mg every 4 weeks (n=47) | 20 mg weekly (n=48)

• | Approximately 98% of patients in the 20mg weekly cohort and approximately 81% of patients in the 60mg every 4 week cohort achieved clinically significant reductions in Lp(a) levels bringing them below the recommended threshold of risk for CVD events (<50 mg/dL).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Treatment with AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx was associated with decreases in LDL-C, apoB, OxPL-apoB, OxPL-apo(a).

• | Most adverse events were mild. The most frequent adverse events were injection site reactions, or ISRs. ISRs occurred in 26% of patients and were mostly mild and one patient discontinued due to an ISR. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There were no safety concerns related to platelet counts, liver function or renal function.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No patient in the study experienced a confirmed platelet count below 100,000/mm3. The incidence of platelet levels below normal (140,000/mm3) was comparable between the active (10.5%) and placebo (14.9%) groups.

 Approximately 90% of patients completed treatment and the rate of discontinuation was comparable between the active (12.1%) and placebo (14.9%) groups.
 Disease Background
 Despite the management of LDL-C with statins and other therapies, the incidence of CVD continues to rise dramatically. Lipid disorders are a cause of this continuing rise. Hyperlipoproteinemia(a), defined as levels of Lp(a) above 30mg/dL,  which is present in approximately 20% of the general population, causes CVD.
 Currently, there is no effective drug therapy to specifically and robustly lower elevated levels of Lp(a). Lp(a) levels are determined at birth and, therefore, lifestyle modification, including diet and exercise, do not impact Lp(a) levels. Statins do not have significant effects on Lp(a) levels. Further, a new class of drugs that lower LDL-C and modestly lower Lp(a) levels, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, inactivate a protein in the plasma that regulates the number of LDL receptors on the liver cell surface, thereby capturing and removing additional LDL particles from the blood. While PCSK9 inhibitors reduce Lp(a) by approximately 25%, we believe this level of reduction is unlikely to materially reduce the risk of cardiovascular events related to hyperlipoproteinemia(a). The only currently known effective way to significantly reduce plasma Lp(a) is to physically remove the particles from blood through a process called apheresis. In this process, the patient's blood is filtered through a machine where the LDL-C and Lp(a) particles are removed and the blood is returned to the patient's body. Since 2010, apheresis has been an approved therapy in Germany to treat patients with hyperlipoproteinemia(a), but it is expensive, time consuming and only performed by a small number of centers worldwide. Lp(a) apheresis has been shown to lower the rate of cardiovascular events, providing support that lowering Lp(a) can provide therapeutic benefit.
 A number of expert groups, including the National Institutes for Health, European Society of Cardiology and the National Lipid Association, and publications have stated that Lp(a) is an independent cause of cardiovascular risk. The authors of three such publications evaluated data from over 180,000 participants and used statistical and genetic approaches to evaluate the correlation between Lp(a) levels and cardiovascular risk. The specific techniques the authors used were epidemiological/meta-analyses, Mendelian randomization and genome wide associations. In each technique used, the authors demonstrated a clear relationship between elevated levels of Lp(a) and increased cardiovascular risk.
 The graphics below further illustrate these correlations:

AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx Commercial Opportunity
 Elevated levels of Lp(a) are associated with increased cardiovascular risk and lowering Lp(a) may reduce the risk. We estimate eligible population, patients with elevated levels of Lp(a) and prior CVD, to be greater than 8 
million people globally. We believe that positive results from a large cardiovascular outcome study will be required to support marketing authorization for the treatment of these patients. Since Novartis has licensed AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, it will conduct, at its expense, such a study pursuant to our strategic collaboration and, if approved, will commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx for these patients. As part of the collaboration, we may co-commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in selected markets, on mutually agreed terms and conditions.
  
• | AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx. We are developing AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx to treat nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD. In preclinical studies, an analog of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-L Rx inhibited the production of the angiopoietin-like 3, or ANGPTL3, protein in the liver, inhibiting liver fat accumulation and lowering blood levels of triglycerides, LDL-C and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or VLDL-C. We have completed a Phase 1/2 program for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-L Rx in people with elevated triglycerides. We observed that the people with elevated triglycerides treated with AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx achieved dose-dependent, statistically significant mean reductions in ANGPTL3 of up to 83%. Treatment with AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx was also associated with statistically significant mean reductions in triglycerides of up to 66%, in LDL-C of up to 35% and in total cholesterol of up to 36%. In this study, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx showed a safety and tolerability profile supporting further development. The most common adverse events in the AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx treated group of patients were mild headaches and dizziness that were approximately equal to the rate observed in the placebo group. We reported results for the initial cohort from this study at the AHA meeting in November 2016 and published the data in the New England Journal of Medicine. We initiated a study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-L Rx in patients with NAFLD with metabolic complications that include hypertriglyceridemia, type 2 diabetes or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. We expect data from this study in 2020. Further, we have a small ongoing pilot study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-L Rx in patients with rare hyperlipidemias.

Disease Background
 Fatty liver disease
 While some fat in the liver is normal, a significant percentage of individuals have elevated levels of liver fat. Individuals with excessive fat accumulation in the liver also have elevated risk of developing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and CVD. These risks are further elevated in patients with hyperlipidemia, especially those with elevated triglyceride levels. The most common form of fatty liver disease is NAFLD, which is associated with obesity-related disorders even in patients who drink little or no alcohol, and is characterized by the gradual accumulation of fat in the liver, or steatosis. One of the key causes of this condition is the Western diet, which is rich in processed foods with high fat and sugar content. In the early stages of NAFLD, patients typically experience steatosis that is slow progressing. Over time, a subset of these patients progresses to steatohepatitis, a more severe and progressive form of NAFLD characterized by chronic inflammation and liver-cell damage, called NASH. Eventually, the chronic inflammation caused by NASH can lead to the formation of scar tissue in the liver, known as fibrosis. As scar tissue gradually replaces healthy liver tissue, blood flow is restricted, which can lead to the loss of normal liver function, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, liver cancer and ultimately liver failure. Currently, there are no approved treatments specifically for NAFLD or NASH. If the disease ultimately progresses beyond NASH, the only alternative is a liver transplant.
 AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx Commercial Opportunity
 NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide and more than 75 million patients are affected in the United States alone. Approximately 30% of patients with NAFLD will eventually progress to NASH. In the United States, the most recent epidemiological studies show that approximately 3% to 5% of the general population has NASH. We believe there are a comparable number of patients in Europe and the rest of the world. While there are a number of treatments currently in development for the treatment of NAFLD and NASH, none are currently approved and we believe there will continue to be a significant unmet medical need in this population.

• | AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. We are developing AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx to inhibit the production of apoC-III, the same protein inhibited by WAYLIVRA, for the broad population of patients who have cardiometabolic disease due to their elevated triglyceride levels. We believe that the enhancements offered by Ionis' LICA technology can provide greater patient convenience by allowing for significantly lower doses, less frequent administration and a favorable safety and tolerability profile. We conducted a Phase 1/2 study of AKCEA-APOCIII-L Rx in people with elevated triglycerides and reported positive results from this study in the second half of 2017 with a safety and tolerability profile supporting

further development. We have initiated a strategic collaboration with Novartis for this drug. In this collaboration, we intend to complete the Phase 2 program required to define the appropriate dose and regimen to support a planned cardiovascular outcome study. We recently initiated a Phase 2b dose-ranging study of AKCEA-APOCIII-L Rx in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and established CVD and plan to report data from this study in 2020. At the completion of Phase 2 development, Novartis has an option to license the drug. Novartis will have 60 days plus additional time that could be required for a Hart-Scott-Rodino, or HSR, filing and review following the end-of-Phase 2 meeting to exercise its option for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. If Novartis exercises its option to license AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, Novartis plans to conduct and pay for a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study in high-risk patients and, if approved, to commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-L Rx worldwide. As part of the collaboration, we may co-commercialize AKCEA- APOCIII-LRx in selected markets, on mutually agreed terms and conditions.

Disease Background
 ApoC-III is an important emerging target linking hypertriglyceridemia with CVD. Several studies have found that apoC-III levels are an independent risk factor for CVD. Further, its presence on lipoproteins may increase their atherogenicity. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that out of a sample of over 100,000 people, individuals with an apoC-III gene loss of function mutation had a reduced risk of clinical coronary heart disease. Each decrease of 1 mg/dL in plasma levels of apoC-III was associated with a 4% decrease in the risk of incident coronary heart disease. Triglycerides may also play a role in cardiovascular risk. As shown in the figure below, in two separate studies encompassing nearly 20,000 patients, as triglyceride levels increased, so did the risk of a cardiovascular event. In summary, apoC-III impacts triglyceride levels and may also increase inflammatory processes, and this combination of effects makes apoC-III a promising target for reducing the residual CVD risk in patients already on statin therapy, but for whom triglycerides are poorly controlled.
 

AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx Commercial Opportunity
 ApoC-III levels and elevated triglycerides have been linked to increased cardiovascular risk and lowering apoC-III and triglycerides may reduce this risk. We estimate the eligible population to be greater than 8 million people globally. We believe that positive results from a large cardiovascular outcome study will be required to support marketing authorization for the treatment of these patients. If Novartis exercises its option to license AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, it plans to conduct, at its expense, such a study pursuant to our strategic collaboration to conduct this study and to commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx for these patients. As part of the collaboration, we may co-commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in selected markets, on mutually agreed terms and conditions.
  
• | AKCEA-TTR-LRx. We are developing AKCEA-TTR-LRx to treat the broad population of patients with both hereditary and wild-type forms of transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR amyloidosis. Based on its profile, we believe AKCEA-TTR-LRx treatment can significantly reduce levels of the TTR protein, which we believe will translate to efficacy in terms of both clinical benefit and quality of life improvements with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. As with other LICA medicines, we believe we can achieve this positive efficacy, safety and tolerability profile with low doses and with the potential for monthly dosing. We initiated a Phase 1/2 study of AKCEA-TTR-LRx in the fourth quarter of 2018 and are working toward a goal of initiating the Phase 3 program in 2019.

Disease Background 
 hATTR amyloidosis is a rare, progressive, and fatal disease that often affects multiple organs, including the nerves, heart, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. hATTR amyloidosis occurs when misfolded TTR protein deposits throughout the body as amyloid fibrils, disrupting tissue and organ structure and function. The burden of hATTR amyloidosis is high as patients often suffer from progressive neuropathy, cardiac, gastrointestinal and psychosocial symptoms affecting every aspect of their life. Without therapeutic intervention, patient quality of life progressively and rapidly deteriorates, leading to a reduction in ambulation and daily function, and ultimately resulting in premature death. As the disease progresses, many patients are no longer able to work and or are forced to take substantial time off. The impact of the disease is not limited to physical symptoms but also impacts mental health and outlook as patients often live in fear and isolation. An accurate and timely diagnosis and early treatment initiation is critical to optimize disease management.
 AKCEA-TTR-LRx Commercial Opportunity
 The introduction of new medicines for the ATTR amyloidosis community will increase awareness and diagnosis while AKCEA-TTR-LRx is being developed. There are currently around 50,000 hATTR amyloidosis patients worldwide and we believe that approximately 60% of patients have symptoms of both polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. We believe the number of people with predominant cardiomyopathy symptoms is significantly underdiagnosed. We believe this is especially true in the African American population in which approximately 3% carry the V122I mutation, one of the most dominant mutations causing ATTR. The epidemiology of wild-type TTR amyloidosis is not well characterized, but the number of patients diagnosed is rapidly increasing. It is estimated that there are more than 200,000 diagnosed people with wild-type ATTR. 
Technology Overview
 Antisense Technology
 Ionis discovered each of the drugs in our pipeline using its innovative antisense technology platform. Antisense technology is based on the use of synthetic nucleic acid sequences, which are primarily used to interrupt the production of a specified protein by targeting the specific corresponding messenger RNA, or mRNA, that encodes that protein. In this way, antisense drugs can be used to reduce the level of proteins that cause, or contribute to, the progression of various diseases. Because there are virtually no undruggable mRNA targets, we believe antisense technology may have broader potential than small molecule- and antibody-based technologies that target proteins. Furthermore, antisense technology has the potential to target a growing number of disease-related genes more directly and efficiently than other protein-directed modalities. We believe this technology represents an important advance in treating diseases.
 The production of a protein starts with a process called transcription, where the instructions for making a protein are transcribed from a gene, or DNA, into mRNA. The cell's protein production process is called translation, and antisense drugs can be designed to interrupt this process by causing the destruction of the targeted mRNA and therefore preventing the production of a protein of interest. The graphic below further illustrates the impact of antisense drugs on the production of proteins via this mechanism of action:
 

Ionis has made significant improvements in its antisense drug technology in recent years, most notably the creation of the advanced ligand conjugated antisense, or LICA technology. Other improvements include the discovery screening processes, which resulted in second-generation drugs with better safety and tolerability properties compared to Ionis' generation 2.0 drugs. These improved second-generation drugs are referred to as generation 2+ drugs.
 12


The unique properties of our antisense drugs provide several potential advantages over traditional drug modalities. These advantages include:
  
• | Precise specificity. Our antisense drugs are created using Ionis' generation 2+ screening processes to bind specifically to the mRNAs they were designed to target, which minimizes or eliminates the possibility of our drugs binding to unintended genetic targets and causing unwanted side effects.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Favorable dosing properties. We believe our drugs have predictable safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties based on Ionis' research and development experience. Further, our drugs have a relatively long half-life of two to four weeks, which enables second generation drugs such as WAYLIVRA to be dosed once weekly and other drugs in our pipeline, which incorporate Ionis' LICA technology, to potentially be dosed once monthly or less frequently. Upon dosing, our drugs distribute well throughout the body, eliminating the need for special formulations or delivery vehicles.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No anticipated drug-to-drug interactions. Because they are nucleic acid based, we believe our drugs can be used in combination with virtually any existing treatment modality without the risk of drug-to-drug interactions or susceptibility to traditional enzyme degradation or metabolism pathways.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad applications to multiple disease targets, multiple tissues and multiple mechanisms. There are virtually no "undruggable" targets with antisense technology.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficient discovery and early development. Because of the efficiency of antisense technology, drug discovery and early development costs and success rates compare favorably to small molecule or antibody drug discovery and development.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Relationship with Ionis
 Ionis formed Akcea as a wholly owned subsidiary to complete development of and commercialize Ionis’ drugs to treat lipid disorders. We began business operations in January 2015. We licensed our cardiometabolic franchise from Ionis at the beginning of 2015. Prior to licensing these drugs, Ionis’ employees performed all of the development, regulatory and manufacturing activities for these drugs either themselves or through third-party providers. As such, Ionis incurred all of the expenses associated with these activities and reported them in its consolidated financial statements. We licensed TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-L Rx from Ionis in April 2018. Prior to then, Ionis had been advancing these drugs in development and incurring the expenses for those activities. Under our license agreements with Ionis, Ionis continued and is continuing to conduct development, regulatory or manufacturing activities for most of our drugs and to charge us for this work. As of December 31, 2018, Ionis owned approximately 75 percent of our outstanding stock.
Exclusive Rights to Development Pipeline and Intellectual Property; Right of First Negotiation
 Ionis is the leading company researching and developing antisense drugs. Under our agreements with Ionis, we have rights to Ionis' proprietary technologies for use with our drugs. Specifically, we obtained an exclusive license from Ionis to globally commercialize our pipeline of drugs, including TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-TTR-LRx. Ionis also agreed that it would not work on its own or with other parties to develop or commercialize antisense drugs that target the same gene targets as the drugs we are developing and commercializing. Under our agreements with Ionis, we have a license to use Ionis' technology platform with our drugs. We also have access to future improvements Ionis may make to its antisense technology platform, such as improved manufacturing technologies.
 In addition, Ionis has granted us a right of first negotiation with respect to Ionis development candidates that are designed to treat a rare cardiometabolic disease or a rare inherited metabolic disease.
 Our Strategic Collaboration with Novartis
 In January 2017, we initiated a strategic collaboration with Novartis for the development and commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. In February 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. Novartis is currently preparing to initiate a Phase 3 study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) and elevated levels of lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a). Novartis is now responsible for all future development and commercialization activities for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. We are eligible to receive license fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx from Novartis if and when it meets the development, regulatory and sales milestones specified in our agreement. In connection with Novartis’ exercise of its option to exclusively license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, Akcea and Novartis established a more definitive framework under which they would negotiate the co-commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx between the two companies in selected markets. Included in this framework is an option by which Novartis could solely commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in exchange for Novartis paying Akcea increased commercial milestone payments based on sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. We will share any license fees, milestone payments and royalties equally with Ionis.
 13


Under the strategic collaboration, option and license agreement, Novartis also has an exclusive option to develop and commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. We are responsible for completing a Phase 2 program and conducting an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and delivering API. Following the successful completion of the Phase 2 program, and prior to initiation of the Phase 3 study, Novartis will be able to exercise its option to license and commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. Novartis will have 60 days plus additional time that could be required for Hart-Scott-Rodino, or HSR, filing and review following the end-of-Phase 2 meeting to exercise its option for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. If Novartis exercises its option, Novartis will be responsible, at its expense, to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. 
 From this collaboration, we received $75.0 million in an upfront option payment, of which we retained $60.0 million and paid Ionis $15.0 million as a sublicense fee under our license agreement with Ionis. In conjunction with this collaboration, Novartis purchased $100.0 million of Ionis' common stock at a premium. We also earned a $150.0 million license fee when Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx of which we will pay $75.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. The $75.0 million obligation to Ionis will be settled in Akcea common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized $50.6 million and $43.4 million of revenue related to our Novartis collaboration, respectively.
 In addition, for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, we are eligible to receive up to $675.0 million in milestone payments, including $25.0 million for the achievement of a development milestone, up to $290.0 million for the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to $360.0 million for the achievement of commercialization milestones. In addition, for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, we are eligible to receive a license fee of $150.0 million and up to $530.0 million in milestone payments, including $25.0 million for the achievement of a development milestone, up to $240.0 million for the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to $265.0 million for the achievement of commercialization milestones. We will earn the next milestone payment of $25.0 million under this collaboration if Novartis advances the Phase 3 study for either drug. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties in the mid-teens to low-twenty percent range on net sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. Novartis will reduce these royalties upon the expiration of certain patents or if a generic competitor negatively impacts the product in a specific country. We will pay 50% of these license fees, milestone payments and royalties to Ionis as a sublicense fee.
 For each product Novartis commercializes under this agreement, we may co-commercialize with Novartis in selected markets, through our specialized sales force, on terms and conditions that we plan to negotiate with Novartis in the future.
 If Novartis does not exercise its option, or stops developing or commercializing after exercising its option with respect to a particular drug, we will have all rights to develop or commercialize the drug (including the right to sublicense these rights to a third party) at our sole expense. If Novartis stops developing or commercializing a drug after exercising its option, and we subsequently commercialize the drug on our own or with another party, we are required to negotiate in good faith and mutually agree with Novartis the terms of a royalty payable to Novartis on the returned drug.
 The agreement with Novartis will continue until the earlier of the date that all of Novartis' options to obtain the exclusive licenses under the agreement expire unexercised or, if Novartis exercises its options, until the expiration of all payment obligations under the agreement. In addition, the agreement as a whole or with respect to any drug under the agreement may terminate early under the following situations:
  
• | Novartis may terminate the agreement as a whole or with respect to any drug at any time by providing written notice to us;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Either we or Novartis may terminate the agreement with respect to any drug by providing written notice to the other party in good faith that we or Novartis have determined that the continued development or commercialization of the drug presents safety concerns that pose an unacceptable risk or threat of harm in humans or would violate any applicable law, ethical principles or principles of scientific integrity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Either we or Novartis may terminate the agreement for a drug by providing written notice to the other party upon the other party's uncured failure to perform a material obligation related to the drug under the agreement, or the entire agreement if the other party becomes insolvent; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We may terminate the agreement if Novartis disputes or assists a third party to dispute the validity of any of our or Ionis' patents.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additionally, in January 2017, we and Ionis entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, or SPA, with Novartis. Under the SPA, in July 2017, Novartis purchased $50.0 million of our common stock in a separate private placement concurrent with the completion of our IPO at a price per share equal to the IPO price.

Competition
 The commercialization of new drugs is competitive, and we may face worldwide competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, nutraceutical companies and ultimately generic companies. Our competitors may develop or market therapies that are more effective, safer, more convenient to use, or less costly than any that we are commercializing, or may obtain regulatory or reimbursement approval for their therapies more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Additionally, mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields.
 With respect to TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-LRx, ONPATTRO (patisiran), which is an RNAi therapy made by Alnylam, is currently marketed for hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy in the U.S. and E.U. The product label for TEGSEDI in the United States has a boxed warning for thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis, requires periodic blood and urine monitoring, and TEGSEDI has a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program. Though ONPATTRO requires intravenous administration and pre-treatment with steroids, it does not have a boxed warning or REMS. In addition, Tafamidis is currently available in the E.U. for stage 1 hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, and is currently under review in the U.S. for ATTR with cardiomyopathy, with a PDUFA date in July 2019. Beyond these drugs that are either marketed or under regulatory review, there are also additional drugs in clinical development. Alnylam is developing next generation RNAi drug vutrisiran which is currently in Phase 3 clinical development in hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, with plans to move into cardiomyopathy. Eidos is developing AG10 for patients with ATTR with cardiomyopathy and has recently completed Phase 2, with plans to move into Phase 3.
 With respect to WAYLIVRA to treat patients with FCS, Gemphire's Gemcabene is being studied in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, defined as triglycerides above 500 mg/dL. Gemphire announced in June 2018 that Gemcabene met its Phase 2b primary endpoint and demonstrated statistically significant lowering of triglycerides in SHTG. In August 2018, however, the FDA has requested that Gemphire produce data from a sub-chronic toxicology study to lift the partial clinical hold that was issued in 2004 (The FDA issued the partial clinical hold as PPAR agonists are potential liver toxins).  The initiation of Phase 3 will not take place until the partial hold is lifted and Gemphire has announced that it plans to conduct these required studies and expects to submit the additional results to the FDA in the second quarter of 2019. 
 Metreleptin is in a Phase 3 trial for FPL patients who also have NASH. Metreleptin is currently approved for use in the U.S. and E.U. in generalized lipodystrophy, or GL patients. Metreleptin does not affect apoC-III levels. ApoC-III levels have been shown to be elevated in FPL patients and directly correlated to triglyceride levels. In addition, many patients with FCS and FPL use diet, niacin, fish oils and/or fibrates to reduce their elevated triglycerides. Niacin, fish oils and fibrates are generally not effective in patients with FCS. The ultra-low-fat diet that patients with FCS and FPL are required to maintain is extremely burdensome to patients and their families. Based on our WAYLIVRA clinical experience, including in individuals with FCS, we believe that WAYLIVRA will work equally well as a single agent or in combination with other triglyceride-lowering drugs or approaches.
 With respect to WAYLIVRA and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, in January 2019, Arrowhead filed for regulatory clearance to begin Phase 1 study of ARO-APOC3, an RNAi-based drug targeting apoC-III for treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.  Arrowhead has announced that it intends to proceed with this Phase 1 single and multiple dose-escalating study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects of ARO-APOC3 in adult healthy volunteers, hypertriglyceridemic patients, and patients with FCS.  To our knowledge, there are currently no other direct competitors for lowering apoC-III in clinical development.
 With respect to AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, we are not aware of any other drugs currently in clinical development specifically for the treatment of hyperlipoproteinemia(a) and associated cardiovascular disease. Arrowhead and Amgen have a Phase 1 program ongoing for AMG890, formerly referred to as ARO-LPA, which uses an RNAi drug conjugated with a GalNAc for the same target as AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx . Under its strategic collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Alnylam, Ionis received an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to Alnylam's chemistry, RNA targeting mechanism and target-specific intellectual property for oligonucleotides against apo(a), which means that Alnylam agreed not to use the exclusively licensed technology to develop or commercialize an oligonucleotide against apo(a).
 AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx may compete with Evinacumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to ANGPTL3 that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing. Evinacumab is currently in Phase 2 development for the treatment of HoFH and severe forms of hyperlipidemia. Additionally, many patients with familial hyperlipidemias are treated using diet and statins, which have limited effect in these patients.

Intellectual Property
 We have in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to WAYLIVRA, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, our other drugs in development and, more generally, the development and commercialization of oligonucleotide therapeutics. Our objective is to continue to develop and strengthen our proprietary position to further protect our drugs.
 We obtained our rights to the patents covering WAYLIVRA, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development and our rights in Ionis' proprietary technology platform and know-how under our development, commercialization and license agreement with Ionis. We seek to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications by filing and prosecuting existing patent rights and filing additional patent applications.
 We seek patent protection in significant markets and/or countries for each drug in development. We also seek to maximize patent term. The patent exclusivity period for a drug will prevent generic drugs from entering the market. Patent exclusivity depends on a number of factors, including initial patent term and available patent term extensions based upon delays caused by the regulatory approval process.
 TTR, TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-LRx Intellectual Property
 We have an exclusive license under Ionis' TTR patent estate to develop and commercialize TEGSEDI and the LICA follow-on drug AKCEA-TTR-LRx.  
 The TTR patent estate includes granted US patents covering the TEGSEDI compound, composition, and uses (e.g. US 8,101,743; US 8,697,860; US 9,061,044; and US 9,399,774) that together provide natural patent term to 2031. We have applied for patent term extension to recapture a portion of the term lost during regulatory review.  The issued claims protect TEGSEDI from generic competition in the United States until at least 2031.  Similar patents covering TEGSEDI are granted in several foreign jurisdictions including Europe and Japan.
 The TTR patent estate also includes granted and pending claims covering AKCEA-TTR-L Rx worldwide.  Granted claims in Europe cover the sequence of AKCEA-TTR-L Rx and its use in treating transthyretin amyloidosis with natural patent term to 2031 (EP2563920). Claims covering the specific chemical composition of AKCEA-TTR-LRx and use in treating transthyretin amyloidosis are pending and have natural patent term to 2034 excluding any additional term adjustments or patent term extensions.
 ApoC-III, WAYLIVRA and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx Intellectual Property
 We have an exclusive license under Ionis' apoC-III patent estate to develop and commercialize WAYLIVRA and the LICA follow-on drug AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. The apoC-III patent estate includes patent claims in the United States drawn to the use of antisense compounds complementary to the mRNA of human apoC-III, including compounds designed to the region targeted by WAYLIVRA and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx (US 7,598,227) which, excluding any additional term adjustments or patent term extensions, expires in 2023. Similar claims covering compounds complementary to any site on human apoC-III have granted in Australia.
 The apoC-III patent estate also includes issued patent claims to the specific antisense sequence and chemical composition of WAYLIVRA in the United States (US 7,750,141), Australia and Europe (EP1622597). The issued claims in the United States should protect WAYLIVRA from generic competition in the United States until at least 2023. In addition, depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA regulatory review, this patent may be eligible for patent term restoration to recapture a portion of the term lost during such review. We are also pursuing additional patent applications directed to methods of using WAYLIVRA and other apoC-III compounds for treating various disorders, including FCS in jurisdictions worldwide. Claims drawn to methods of using apoC-III specific inhibitors, and specifically compounds designed to target the same sequence as WAYLIVRA and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, for treating FCS have issued in the United States (US 9,593,333) and will expire in 2034, excluding any additional term adjustments or patent term extensions.
 The apoC-III patent estate also includes issued patent claims covering the specific chemical composition of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in the United States (US 9,163,239). The claims should protect AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx from generic competition until at least 2034. We are pursuing additional patent coverage for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in jurisdictions worldwide.
 16


Apo(a) and AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx Intellectual Property
 We have an exclusive license under Ionis' apo(a) patent estate to develop and commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. The apo(a) patent estate includes issued patent claims to the specific antisense sequence and chemical composition of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in the United States (US 9,181,550). The issued claims directed to the composition should protect AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx from generic competition in the United States until at least 2034. In addition, patent term restoration may be available to recapture a portion of the term lost during FDA regulatory review. We are also pursuing additional patent applications designed to protect the AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx composition and additional dosing and methods of use in jurisdictions worldwide.
 ANGPTL3 and AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx Intellectual Property
 We have an exclusive license under Ionis' ANGPTL3 patent estate to develop and commercialize AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx. The ANGPTL3 patent estate includes issued patent claims drawn to the use of antisense compounds complementary to ANGPTL3 RNA for inhibiting the production of ANGPTL3 (US 8,653,047). The ANGPTL3 patent estate also includes issued patent claims covering the specific antisense sequence and chemical composition of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in the United States (US 9,382,540). The issued claims directed to the chemical composition should protect AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx from generic competition until at least 2035. We are pursuing additional patent claims designed to protect the sequence and chemical composition of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in jurisdictions worldwide.
 Trade Secrets
 In addition to the protections afforded by patents and other regulatory protections, we may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. Trade secrets may be useful to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or which we elect not to patent. Trade secrets may also be useful for processes or improvements for which patents are difficult to enforce. We also protect our drugs and the proprietary technology platform by confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
Manufacturing
 Ionis has dedicated significant resources to develop ways to improve manufacturing efficiency and capacity. Since Ionis can use variants of the same nucleotide building blocks and the same type of equipment to produce our oligonucleotide drugs, we and Ionis found that the same techniques used to efficiently manufacture one oligonucleotide drug could help improve the manufacturing processes for many other oligonucleotide drugs. With Ionis’ expertise in optimizing manufacturing of oligonucleotides, we and Ionis believe we can develop new processes to scale up manufacturing of our LICA medicines at commercially competitive prices. By developing several proprietary chemical processes to scale up our manufacturing capabilities, Ionis has greatly reduced the cost of producing oligonucleotide drugs. For example, they have significantly reduced the cost of raw materials through improved yield efficiency, while at the same time increasing capacity to make the drugs. Through both Ionis’ internal research and development programs and collaborations with outside vendors we and Ionis may achieve even greater efficiency and further cost reductions. In connection with Novartis’ exercise of its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, and if Novartis exercises its option to license AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, Novartis will be responsible for the long-term supply of drug substance and finished drug product for the licensed drug.
 
TEGSEDI
 For TEGSEDI’s commercial drug supply, we are using contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce custom raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished goods. Our CMO partners have extensive technical expertise and current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, experience. We believe our current network of CMO partners are capable of providing sufficient quantities to meet anticipated commercial demands. Additionally, we continue to evaluate relationships with additional suppliers to increase overall capacity as well as reduce further risks. While we believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our commercial requirements, we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs. We also cannot provide assurance that we will not experience a disruption in supply from our current CMO partners.
 CMOs are subject to the FDA’s cGMP requirements and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We depend on our CMO partners for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards.
 17


WAYLIVRA
 Ionis has supplied us with API and finished drug product to complete our ongoing activities for WAYLIVRA through either Ionis’ own manufacturing processes or through outside vendors. Ionis has also supplied the API and the finished drug product for WAYLIVRA’s commercial launch, if approved. We believe the API and drug product is adequate for at least the first two years of WAYLIVRA’s commercial launch. We plan to leverage our relationships with CMOs, to procure our own long-term raw material and drug supplies at competitive prices in the future.
 LICA Pipeline
 We believe we have sufficient manufacturing capacity, through Ionis, to meet our current development needs, including the ongoing studies for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-TTR-LRx. We believe that we have, or will be able to develop or acquire, sufficient supply capacity to meet our anticipated future needs. Ionis has supplied the API and the finished drug product for the clinical studies for each of the drugs in our pipeline through the completion of the on-going studies. Ionis also has agreed to supply and has supplied the API and the finished drug product for our drugs. We and Ionis have long-standing and strong relationships with third-party vendors who can supply us with both API and finished drug product and are currently supplying API and finished drug product to other of Ionis' partners. Ionis also has long-standing and strong relationships with the vendors who supply the key raw materials to Ionis to make our drugs and to a major oligonucleotide CMO. We also believe that with anticipated benefits from increases in scale and improvements in chemistry, through Ionis or third parties, we will be able to manufacture our antisense drugs at commercially reasonable prices.
 For LICA-conjugated drugs, to date, Ionis has manufactured itself or through a contract manufacturing organization only limited supplies of LICA for their own and our own nonclinical and clinical studies. LICA enables lower doses than unconjugated oligonucleotides. Along with Ionis' expertise in optimizing manufacturing of oligonucleotides, we believe this will enable the development of new processes to scale up manufacturing of these LICA conjugated drugs at commercially competitive prices.
 Government Regulation and Approval
 United States—FDA Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of drugs. To obtain regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, and subsequently comply with applicable statutes and regulations, we will need to spend substantial time and financial resources.
Approval Process
 The FDA must approve any new unapproved drug or certain changes to a previously approved drug before a manufacturer can market it in the United States. If a company does not comply with applicable United States requirements, it may be subject to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending applications, Warning or Untitled Letters, clinical holds, drug recalls, drug seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. The steps we must complete before we can market a drug include:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical studies start. The sponsor must update the IND annually;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval of the study by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical study begins;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication to the FDA's satisfaction;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | potential review of the drug application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 18


 
• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, cGMP, or regulations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 It generally takes companies many years to satisfy the FDA approval requirements, but this varies substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the drug or disease. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of a drug's chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the drug. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The company submits the results of the preclinical testing to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about the drug's chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical study protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after submitting the initial IND.
 The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND before a company can begin clinical testing in humans in the United States. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the IND sponsor may begin the proposed clinical study. However, the FDA may, within the 30-day time period, raise concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical studies and place the clinical study on a clinical hold. In such a case, the company and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the company begins the clinical study. Accordingly, the submission of an IND may or may not be sufficient for the FDA to permit the sponsor to start a clinical study. The company must also make a separate submission to an existing IND for each successive clinical study conducted during drug development.
 Clinical Studies
 Clinical studies involve administering the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The company must conduct clinical studies:

• | in compliance with federal regulations;
--+----------------------------------------


• | in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical study sponsors, administrators and monitors; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the safety monitoring parameters and the effectiveness criteria.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The company must submit each protocol involving testing on United States patients and subsequent protocol amendments to the FDA as part of the IND. The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical study at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the sponsor is not conducting the clinical study in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical study patients. The sponsor must also submit the study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical studies to an IRB for approval. An IRB may halt the clinical study, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 Companies generally divide the clinical investigation of a drug into three or four phases.
  
• | Phase 1. The company evaluates the drug in healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies typically evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational new drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The company administers the drug to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The company administers the drug to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites, to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a drug on the company's agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. We typically refer to such post-approval studies as Phase 4 clinical studies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 19


While companies usually conduct these phases sequentially, they are sometimes overlapped or combined. A combined phase trial, such as a Phase 1/2 or a Phase 2/3 trial, is one that combines elements of objectives from two ordinarily sequential phases of development. For example, in a Phase 1/2 trial, the objectives may include both dose-finding and initial efficacy. In a Phase 2/3 trial, dosing regimen or population selection objectives are combined with confirmation of the safety and efficacy of the administration schedule in the intended population.
 A pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements to evaluate a drug's efficacy and safety to justify the approval of the drug. Generally, pivotal studies are Phase 3 studies, but the FDA may accept results from Phase 2 studies if the study design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations in which there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust.
 The FDA, the IRB or the clinical study sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, may oversee some clinical studies. This group provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical study based on evolving business objectives and the competitive climate.
 Submission of an NDA
 After we complete the required clinical testing, we can prepare and submit an NDA to the FDA, which must approve the NDA before we can start marketing the drug in the United States. An NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the drug's chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies on a drug, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing authorization, the data we submit must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug to the FDA's satisfaction.
 The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to annual program user fees. The FDA typically increases these fees annually. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether it will accept the application for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the FDA accepts the filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding to standard review NDAs within ten months after the 60-day filing review period, but this timeframe is often extended. The FDA reviews most applications for standard review drugs within ten to 12 months and most applications for priority review drugs within six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee. This is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts that will review, evaluate and recommend whether the FDA should approve the application. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the drug unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 The FDA's Decision on an NDA
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter indicates that the FDA has completed its review of the application and the agency has determined that it will not approve the application in its present form. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional clinical data and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical studies, preclinical studies and/or manufacturing. The FDA has committed to reviewing resubmissions of the NDA addressing such deficiencies in two or six months, depending on the type of information included. Even if we submit such data, the 
 20


FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Also, the government may establish additional requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, or the FDA's policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our drugs under development.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, the FDA may condition approval on substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy. Once granted, the FDA may withdraw drug approvals if the company fails to comply with regulatory standards or identifies problems following initial marketing.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before we can implement the change. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing new NDAs. As with new NDAs, the FDA often significantly extends the review process with requests for additional information or clarification.
 Expedited review and accelerated approval programs
 A sponsor may seek approval of its drug candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA's review and approval of NDAs. For example, the FDA may grant Fast Track Designation to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that has potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The key benefits of Fast Track Designation are the eligibility for priority review, rolling review (submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted), and accelerated approval, if the application meets relevant criteria. Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical study(ies) submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The FDA grants priority review where there is evidence that the proposed drug would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If the criteria for priority review are not met, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve an NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. The FDA generally requires post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing authorization to verify the drug's clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its drug candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug can, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
 Post-approval Requirements
 The FDA regulates drugs that we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA approvals and has specific requirements pertaining to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, drug sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. After approval, the FDA must provide review and approval for most changes to the approved drug, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed drugs, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a drug on the sponsor's agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. We typically refer to such post-approval studies as Phase 4 clinical studies.
 21


Drug manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. There are strict regulations regarding changes to the manufacturing process, and depending on the significance of the change, it may require prior FDA approval before we can implement it. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our drugs and we expect to rely in the future on third parties for the production of commercial quantities. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a drug, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the drug from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial actions that could delay or prohibit further marketing.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if a company does not comply with regulatory requirements and maintain standards or if problems occur after the drug reaches the market. If a company or the FDA discovers previously unknown problems with a drug, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, issues with manufacturing processes or the company's failure to comply with regulatory requirements, the FDA may require revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; impose post-marketing studies or other clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or impose distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences may include:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the drug, complete withdrawal of the drug from the market or drug recalls;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA refusing to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspending or revoking drug license approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | drug seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of drugs; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. We could be subject to significant liability if we violated these laws and regulations.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.
 Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a drug receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the drug has orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the drug with orphan exclusivity.
 22


Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which the FDA has granted an orphan designation.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration
 Patent term can also be extended based on the amount of time the patented drug spends in regulatory review for drug approval. The length of time between drug launch and patent expiration is significantly less than the full 20-year patent term because companies often obtain the patents relating to a drug early in development and the development path for regulatory approval is long. In the United States, The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called patent term restoration, for a patent on a drug governed by the FDCA. The length of patent term restoration is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term restoration can be a maximum of 5 years and cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of drug approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug in that jurisdiction.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD.
 Specifically, in order to approve an ANDA, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the RLD. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to an RLD if "the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug…"
 Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates that the generic drug is "therapeutically equivalent" to the RLD and it assigns a therapeutic equivalence rating to the approved generic drug in its publication "Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations," also referred to as the "Orange Book." Physicians and pharmacists consider an "AB" therapeutic equivalence rating to mean that a generic drug is fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA's designation of an "AB" rating often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
 The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application, and are not bioavailability or bioequivalence studies. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.
 23


Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-month Stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors must list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant's drug or a method of using the drug. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference drug in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new drug.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new drug will not infringe the already approved drug's listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the FDA will not approve the ANDA application until all the listed patents claiming the referenced drug have expired.
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 Disclosure of Clinical Study Information
 Sponsors of clinical studies of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical study information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical study is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical studies after completion. Disclosure of the results of these studies can be delayed until the new drug or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the PPACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are, among others, the following:

• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, unless the drug is subject to discounts under the 340B drug discount program;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 24


 
• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | new requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act for drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new requirement to annually report certain drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to licensed practitioners, or to pharmacies of hospitals or other healthcare entities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to or proposals to amend certain aspects of PPACA. We expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to it in the future.
 In addition, other health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States since PPACA was enacted. For example, as a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011, providers are subject to Medicare payment reductions of 2% per fiscal year through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments from providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
 European Union—EMA Process
 In the European Union, drugs follow a similar demanding process as that we described above for the United States and the ICH Common Technical Document is the basis for applications. Prior to submitting a European Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, it is necessary to gain approval of a detailed Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, with the European Medicines Agency's Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. After gaining PIP approval, EU regulatory authorities can authorize the drug using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
Centralized Procedure
 Under the centralized procedure, after the EMA issues an opinion, the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that: are derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering; contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; and are officially designated orphan drugs. For drugs that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the drug concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health. WAYLIVRA has been granted a Promising Innovative Medicine, or PIM, Designation by the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, for the treatment of people with FCS. A PIM Designation is an early indication that a medicinal product is a promising candidate for the Early Access to Medicines Scheme, or EAMS, in the UK, intended for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a life-threatening or seriously debilitating condition, with the potential to address an unmet medical need.
 25


National Authorization Procedures
 There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:

• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that does not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Thereafter, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good Manufacturing Practices
 Like the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States, and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacturing of drugs prior to approving a drug. If, after receiving clearance from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. Once we or our partners commercialize drugs, we will be required to comply with cGMP and drug-specific regulations enforced by the European Commission, the EMA and the competent authorities of European Union Member States following drug approval. Also like the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States, and other regulatory agencies also conduct regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities and processes following the initial approval of a drug. If, as a result of these inspections, the regulatory agencies determine that our or our partners' equipment, facilities, or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of drug approval, they may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations or the withdrawal of our drug from the market.
Data and Market Exclusivity
 Similar to the United States, there is a process to authorize generic versions of innovative drugs in the European Union. Generic competitors can submit abridged applications to authorize generic versions of drugs authorized by EMA through a centralized procedure referencing the innovator's data and demonstrating bioequivalence to the reference drug, among other things. New drugs in the European Union can receive eight years of data exclusivity coupled with two years of market exclusivity, and a potential one-year extension, if the marketing authorizations holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that demonstrates "significant clinical benefit" in comparison with existing therapies. This system is usually referred to as "8+2." Abridged applications cannot rely on an innovator's data until after expiry of the eight-year date exclusivity term, meaning that a competitor can file an application for a generic drug, but the drug cannot be marketed until the end of the market exclusivity term.
Other International Markets—Drug Approval Process
 In some international markets (such as China or Japan), although data generated in United States or European Union studies may be submitted in support of a marketing authorization application, regulators may require additional clinical studies conducted in the host territory, or studying people of the ethnicity of the host territory, prior to the filing or approval of marketing applications within the country.
Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drugs for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in other countries, sales of any drugs for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drugs on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drugs can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor's decision to cover a particular drug does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development.

Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of drugs and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain coverage and reimbursement for any drug that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our drug. These studies will be in addition to the studies required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a drug to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the drug after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its drugs at a profit.
 The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the PPACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drugs, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies' share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for our drugs.
 In the European community, governments influence the price of drugs through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those drugs to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which drugs may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new drugs. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any drugs for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the focus on cost containment measures in the United States and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if we attain favorable coverage and reimbursement status for one or more drugs for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Sales and Marketing
 Numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and similar foreign, state and local government authorities, regulate sales, promotion and other activities following drug approval. As described above, the FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for drugs under its jurisdiction both prior to and after approval. Only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that the FDA has approved may be used in labeling. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug's labeling and that differ from those we tested and the FDA approved. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties and often reflect a physician's belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for the patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label uses. If we do not comply with applicable FDA requirements, we may face adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. Promotion of off-label uses of drugs can also implicate the false claims laws described below.
 In the United States sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare "fraud and abuse," including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions, limited statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations and very few court decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Moreover, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the PPACA among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes to clarify that a person or entity does not need to have 
 27


actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, PPACA clarifies that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment, to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our drugs may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers under the so-called "responsible corporate officer" doctrine, even in situations where the executive officer did not intend to violate the law and was unaware of any wrongdoing.
 Given the significant penalties and fines that can be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and corporate integrity agreements. If the government were to allege or convict us or our executive officers of violating these laws, our business could be harmed. In addition, private individuals can bring similar actions. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. Other healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; analogous state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Further, there are an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state authorities.
 Similar rigid restrictions are imposed on the promotion and marketing of drugs in the European Union and other countries. Even in those countries where we may not be directly responsible for the promotion and marketing of our drugs, if our potential international distribution partners engage in inappropriate activity it can have adverse implications for us.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
