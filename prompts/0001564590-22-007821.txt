ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 We were formed as a Delaware limited partnership in 2011 primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of motor fuel and the ownership and leasing of real estate used in the retail distribution of motor fuel. We also generate revenues from the operation of company operated retail sites.
 On November 19, 2019, subsidiaries of DMP purchased from subsidiaries of Circle K: 1) 100% of the membership interests in the sole member of the General Partner; 2) 100% of the IDRs issued by the Partnership; and 3) an aggregate of 7,486,131 common units of the Partnership. As a result of this transaction, we are no longer an affiliate of, and are independent of, Circle K.
 Through its control of DMP, the Topper Group controls the sole member of our General Partner and has the ability to appoint all of the members of the Board and to control and manage the operations and activities of the Partnership. As of February 24, 2022, the Topper Group also has beneficial ownership of a 38.5% limited partner interest in the Partnership. 
 Our principal executive office address is 645 Hamilton Street, Suite 400, Allentown, PA 18101, and our telephone number is (610) 625-8000. Our common units trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “CAPL.”
 We conduct our business through two operating segments – wholesale and retail. As of December 31, 2021, we distributed motor fuel on a wholesale basis to approximately 1,750 sites located in 34 states. We own or lease approximately 1,150 sites, of which we operate 252 as company operated sites.
 The financial statements reflect the consolidated results of the Partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Our primary operations are conducted by the following consolidated wholly owned subsidiaries:
 
 
• | LGW and CAPL JKM Wholesale, which distribute motor fuels on a wholesale basis and generate qualifying income under Section 7704(d) of the Internal Revenue Code;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | LGPR, which functions as the real estate holding company and holds assets that generate qualifying rental income under Section 7704(d) of the Internal Revenue Code;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | LGWS, which owns and leases (or leases and sub-leases) real estate and personal property used in the retail sale of motor fuels, as well as provides maintenance and other services to its customers. In addition, LGWS sells motor fuel on a retail basis at sites operated by commission agents. Since our acquisition of retail and wholesale assets that closed on April 14, 2020, LGWS also sells motor fuels on a retail basis and sells convenience merchandise items to end customers at company operated retail sites. Income from LGWS generally is not qualifying income under Section 7704(d) of the Internal Revenue Code; and

• | Joe’s Kwik Marts, which owns and leases real estate and personal property at our company operated sites that we recently acquired from 7-Eleven. Joe’s Kwik Marts also sells motor fuels on a retail basis and sells convenience merchandise items to end customers. Income from Joe’s Kwik Marts generally is not qualifying income under Sections 7704(d) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Operations
 Wholesale Segment
 Our primary operation is the wholesale distribution of motor fuel. Our wholesale segment generated 2021 revenues of $3.1 billion and operating income of $138 million. The wholesale segment includes the wholesale distribution of motor fuel to lessee dealers, independent dealers, commission agents, DMS (through the closing of the April 2020 acquisition of retail and wholesale assets as further described in Note 4 to the financial statements), and company operated retail sites. We have exclusive motor fuel distribution contracts with lessee dealers who lease the property from us. We also have exclusive distribution contracts with independent dealers to distribute motor fuel but do not collect rent from the independent dealers. Similar to lessee dealers, we had motor fuel distribution and lease agreements with DMS (through the closing of the acquisition of retail and wholesale assets).
 We are one of the ten largest independent distributors by motor fuel volume in the United States for ExxonMobil, BP and Shell, and we also distribute Chevron, Sunoco, Valero, Gulf, Citgo, Marathon and Phillips 66-branded motor fuels (approximately 92% of the motor fuel we distributed during 2021 was branded). For approximately 62% of gallons sold to our customers, we receive a per gallon rate equal to the posted rack price, less any applicable discounts, plus transportation costs, taxes and a fixed rate per gallon of motor fuel. The remaining gallons are primarily DTW priced contracts, including intersegment sales to the retail segment. These contracts provide for variable, market-based pricing.
 Regarding our supplier relationships, a majority of our total gallons of motor fuel purchased are subject to Terms Discounts for prompt payment and other rebates and incentives, which are recorded within cost of sales. Prompt payment discounts are based on a percentage of the purchase price of motor fuel. As such, the dollar value of these discounts increases and decreases corresponding with motor fuel prices. Therefore, in periods of lower wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is negatively affected, and, in periods of higher wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is positively affected (as it relates to these discounts). Based on our current volumes, we estimate a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil would impact our overall annual wholesale motor fuel gross profit by approximately $2.8 million related to these payment discounts.
 The following table highlights the aggregate volume of motor fuel distributed by our wholesale segment to each of our principal customer groups (in millions). See Item 7—Results of Operations for additional information on the drivers of the fluctuations in the volume and site counts below.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exclusive distribution contracts with dealers who lease property from us run concurrent in length to the retail site’s lease period (generally three to 10 years).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leases are generally triple net leases.
--+----------------------------------------


• | As of December 31, 2021, the average remaining lease agreement term was 3.1 years.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commission Agents 
 
 
• | LGW distributes motor fuel on a wholesale basis to LGWS, which owns the motor fuel inventory and sells motor fuel to retail customers. LGW records qualifying wholesale motor fuel distribution gross income in our wholesale segment and LGWS records the non-qualifying retail sale in our retail segment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LGW and CAPL JKM Wholesale record qualifying wholesale motor fuel distribution gross income in our wholesale segment and LGWS and Joe’s Kwik Marts record the non-qualifying retail sale in our retail segment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DMS
 
Prior to April 14, 2020, we owned or leased property and then leased or subleased the site to DMS and distributed fuel to DMS. DMS owned the motor fuel and retail site inventory and set its own pricing and gross profit margin. Since the April 14, 2020 acquisition of retail and wholesale assets, we no longer sell fuel nor lease sites to DMS. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information.
Circle K
 In conjunction with transactions completed in 2014 and 2015, we owned property and leased retail sites to Circle K. We also distributed motor fuel to Circle K. Many of the sites previously owned and leased to Circle K were sold in the asset exchanges with Circle K. The sites that have been sold have been reclassified as independent dealer sites as we no longer control the property but continue to distribute fuel to such sites. At the sites to which we continue to distribute motor fuel, Circle K owns all motor fuel and retail site inventory and sets its own pricing and gross profit margin. As of December 31, 2021, we distribute fuel on a wholesale basis to 42 Circle K sites and lease 11 sites to Circle K. As of December 31, 2021, there are only five sites at which we both supply fuel and lease the property to Circle K, which are categorized in the table above as lessee dealer sites.
Rental Income
 We also generate revenues through leasing or subleasing our real estate. We own or lease real and personal property and we lease or sublease that property to tenants, the substantial majority of which are wholesale customers as described above. As such, we manage our real estate leasing activities congruently with our wholesale segment. We own approximately 60% of our properties that we lease to our dealers or utilize in our retail business. Our lease agreements with third-party landlords have an average remaining lease term of 5.6 years as of December 31, 2021.

The following table presents rental income (in millions), including rental income from commission agents that is included in the retail segment, and the number of sites from which rental income was generated:
  
 | Rental Income Year Ended December 31, | | Sites from which Rental Income was Generated End of Year | 
------+---------------------------------------+------+----------------------------------------------------------+--
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | | 2019 | | 2021 | 2020 | | 2019
Total | $ | 83.2 | | $ | 83.2 | | $ | 90.1 | | 900 | | 948 | 1,003

 Rental income decreased in 2020 primarily as a result of terminating leases in connection with the April 2020 acquisition of retail and wholesale assets. 
 CST Fuel Supply
 In 2015, we purchased a 17.5% limited partner interest in CST Fuel Supply from CST. We received pro rata distributions from CST Fuel Supply related to CST Marketing and Supply’s distribution of motor fuel to the majority of CST’s legacy U.S. retail sites.
 Effective March 25, 2020, we divested our entire interest in CST Fuel Supply in the CST Fuel Supply Exchange as further described in Note 4 to the financial statements.
 Retail Segment
 Our retail segment generated 2021 revenues of $1.4 billion and operating income of $5.5 million. The retail segment includes the sale of convenience merchandise items at company operated sites and the retail sale of motor fuel at company operated and commission sites.
 See Note 3 to the financial statements for information related to our acquisition of certain assets from 7-Eleven. With this transaction and the April 2020 acquisition of retail and wholesale assets, we not only added wholesale fuel contracts to our portfolio but also added retail assets and reestablished a retail capability that enables us to pursue a broader range of acquisition opportunities and provides greater flexibility for optimizing the class of trade for each asset in our portfolio.

Subsequent to an acquisition and throughout the life cycle of a retail site, we evaluate the optimal operation of each site as company operated, lessee dealer or commission, or we consider strategic alternatives, including divesting the site.
 The following chart depicts how motor fuel and convenience merchandise is procured and distributed to our customer groups and our company operated retail sites. The chart also depicts the relationship of our real estate activities to our customer groups.
 
Recent Developments
 See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments” for a discussion of completed transactions affecting our business and a discussion of the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Business Strategy and Objective
 Our primary business objective is to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders and, over time, to increase our quarterly cash distributions while maintaining discipline with leverage. The amount of any distribution is subject to the discretion of the Board, and the Board may modify or revoke the cash distribution policy at any time. Our Partnership Agreement does not require us to pay any distributions.
 Our business strategy to achieve our objective of paying and, over time, increasing our quarterly cash distributions, is focused on the following key initiatives:
 
 
• | Expand within and beyond our existing markets through acquisitions. Since our IPO and through February 24, 2022, we have completed acquisitions for a total of approximately 1,000 fee and leasehold sites and 700 wholesale fuel supply contracts for total consideration of approximately $1.5 billion;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhance our real estate business’ cash flows by owning or leasing sites in prime locations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase our wholesale segment by expanding market share and growing rental income over time;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintain strong relationships with major integrated oil companies and refiners; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimize the operations of acquired assets to the most appropriate format (lessee dealer, independent dealer, retail site) to provide for more stable cash flows and maximize our investment return.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 10

We believe our competitive strengths will allow us to capitalize on our strategic opportunities, including:
 
 
• | Stable cash flows from real estate rent income and wholesale motor fuel distribution;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Established history of acquiring sites and successfully integrating these sites and operations into our existing business;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Long-term relationships with major integrated oil companies and other key suppliers, which support our negotiations with and enable us to collaboratively work with our suppliers to maximize benefits to the Partnership; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prime real estate locations in areas with high traffic and considerable motor fuel consumption.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supplier Arrangements
 We distribute branded motor fuel under the Exxon, Mobil, BP, Shell, Chevron, Sunoco, Valero, Gulf, Citgo, Marathon and Phillips 66 brands to our customers. Branded motor fuels are purchased from major integrated oil companies and refiners under supply agreements. For 2021, our wholesale segment purchased approximately 37%, 22%, 11% and 10% of its motor fuel from ExxonMobil, BP, Motiva and Marathon, respectively. Certain suppliers offer volume rebates or incentive payments to drive volumes and provide an incentive for branding new locations. Certain suppliers require that all or a portion of any such incentive payments be repaid to the supplier in the event that the sites are rebranded within a stated number of years. We also purchase unbranded motor fuel for distribution. As of December 31, 2021, our supply agreements had a weighted-average remaining term of approximately 4.9 years.
Competition
 Our wholesale segment competes with other motor fuel distributors. Major competitive factors for us include, among others, customer service, price and quality of service and availability of products.
 The convenience store industry is highly competitive, fragmented and characterized by constant change in the number and type of retailers offering products and services of the type sold at our sites. We compete with other retail site chains, independently owned retail sites, motor fuel stations, supermarkets, drugstores, discount stores, dollar stores, club stores and hypermarkets. Major competitive factors include, among others, location, ease of access, product and service selection, motor fuel brands, pricing, customer service, store appearance, and cleanliness.
 Seasonality
 Our business exhibits substantial seasonality due to our wholesale and retail sites being located in certain geographic areas that are affected by seasonal weather and temperature trends and associated changes in retail customer activity during different seasons. Historically, sales volumes have been highest in the second and third quarters (during the summer activity months) and lowest during the winter months in the first and fourth quarters.
Trade Names, Service Marks and Trademarks
 We are a wholesale distributor of motor fuel for various major integrated oil companies and are licensed to market/resell motor fuel under their respective motor fuel brands.
 We are not aware of any facts that would negatively affect our continuing use of any trademarks, trade names or service marks.
 Environmental Laws and Regulations
 We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to USTs, the release or discharge of materials into the air, water and soil, waste management, pollution prevention measures, storage, handling, use and disposal of hazardous materials, the exposure of persons to hazardous materials, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics, composition, storage and sale of motor fuel and the health and safety of our employees. We incorporate by reference into this section our disclosures included in Note 2 under the captions “Environmental Matters” and “Asset Retirement Obligations” as well as Note 11 under the caption “Asset Retirement Obligations” and Note 16 to the financial statements.
Other Regulatory Matters
 Our retail sites are subject to regulation by federal, state, and/or local agencies and to licensing and regulations by state and local health, sanitation, safety, fire and other departments relating to the development and operation of retail sites, including regulations relating to zoning and building requirements and the preparation and sale of food.
 11

Our retail sites are also subject to federal, state and/or local laws governing such matters as wage rates, overtime, working conditions and citizenship requirements. At the federal, state and local levels, there are proposals under consideration from time to time to increase minimum wage rates and modify or restrict immigration policies.
 Human Capital
 
The Partnership has no direct employees. As of December 31, 2021, 215 employees of the Topper Group provided management services to us under the Topper Group Omnibus Agreement. In addition, 2,003 store employees of the Topper Group provided services at our company operated sites.
 
Our human capital resources objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees. As a customer-centric company with a strong service culture, we constantly work to maintain our position as an employer of choice. This requires a commitment to workplace inclusion and safety, as well as competitive total compensation that meets the needs of our employees. Our talent management and succession plan process includes the identification of key positions based on current and future business strategies, the identification of potential successors and a plan for talent development.
 
We are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the evolving effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our business. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments—COVID-19 Pandemic” for a discussion of our efforts to reduce the risks of exposure to COVID-19.
