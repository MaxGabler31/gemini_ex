ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

Overview
 
We are a Nevada corporation in the industrial hemp market operating through our wholly-owned subsidiaries (listed more fully below). Based upon our knowledge and expertise in the regulation of the industrial hemp industry, our business plan involves creating a sustainable business model to grow crops and manufacture products from hemp farmland and to market, sell, and distribute hemp derivative products such as cannabidiol (“CBD”) distillate and isolate, while exploring other business opportunities that complement our core business. At this time, we cultivate industrial hemp, process it into a derivative product via a toll processing relationship, and then we sell the hemp derivative product, such as CBD, on a wholesale basis. We plan to cultivate industrial hemp on our 320-acre farm in Pueblo, Colorado (the “Farm”) through our wholly owned subsidiary, EWSD I, LLC d/b/a Shi Farms, a Delaware limited liability company (“Shi Farms”). In 2017, we completed a pilot study on the Farm, where we planted 15 acres of land, which was processed by a third-party contractor and distributed the derivative product through our network. Based on the pilot study, we engaged in a “scale-up pilot study” where we planted and harvested an aggregate of 100 acres of land in the planting season (early June to the end of September) of 2018. In 2019, we have planted 830 acres, which included corporate-owned land as well as land farmed via our co-operative farming program.
 
Through our subsidiary, NY – SHI, LLC, a New York limited liability company (“NY – SHI”), we conducted a similar pilot study on 1.5 acres in the Hudson Valley region of New York State in 2018 through a contractor to determine if it is viable to cultivate industrial hemp in New York on a larger scale. We have received good education on our pilot study and are considering scaling in 2019.
 
On May 10, 2019, we, through our subsidiary Shi Farms, entered into a Partner Farm Agreement (the “Partner Farm Agreement”) with Mile High Labs, Inc, a Colorado company (“Mile High”). Pursuant to the Partner Farm Agreement, we have agreed to produce, sell, and/or deliver certain dried hemp products (the “Product”) to Mile High, and Mile High agreed to purchase such Product from us and/or provide certain processing services (the “Processing Services”). Among other obligations, we agreed to provide a physical location to perform such Processing Services on our property (the “Property”), the infrastructure necessary to access the Property, and the construction of certain structures for the purpose of conducting the Processing Services on the Property. Among other obligations, Mile High is required to provide, transport, and install all necessary equipment to operate the processing facilities located on the Property, subject to the terms and provisions therein. Mile High also agreed to provide us with priority processing services for the Product specified in the Partner Farm Agreement, of up to 25% of the production capacity of the processing facilities operated by Mile High on the Property. The Partner Farm Agreement has an initial term of five years and renews automatically thereafter for one-year increments. We receive 20% of all sales of the Product and Mile High will receive 80% of the sales price, subject to the payment schedule and terms attached thereto. We will have no processing costs for the production of this oil/isolate.
 
In connection with, and pursuant to, the Partner Farm Agreement, we also entered into a Supply Agreement, dated May 10, 2019 (the “Supply Agreement”; and, together with the Partner Farm Agreement, the “MH Agreements”), with Mile High, whereby we produce and sell to Mile High, and Mile High purchases and accepts from us the Products enumerated in the MH Agreements in quantities specified in the MH Agreements and by Mile High from time-to-time. Pursuant to the Supply Agreement, following the processing of the Product, Mile High and we agreed, among other things, to sell the finished Product as partners and to co-brand the finished Product with both Mile High’s and our name and logo. Should Mile High establish a cooperative advertising and promotional program, we will be required to pay a co-op fee equal to 3% of the amount of the purchase order from Mile High. The initial term of the Supply Agreement is five years and renews automatically for one-year increments.

On May 31, 2017, we, and two of our subsidiaries, Shi Farms and Pueblo Agriculture Supply and Equipment LLC (“PASE”), and Trava LLC, a Florida limited liability company that has lent various sums to us (“Trava”), entered into a Management Services Agreement (the “MS Agreement”) with respect to our hemp grow located at the Farm. The MS Agreement had a 36-month term with two consecutive 12-month unilateral options, exercisable in the sole discretion of Trava. Pursuant to the provisions of the MS Agreement, Trava collected all revenue generated by the Farm operations. Further, Trava had to satisfy all of our Farm-related past due expenses and, subject to certain limitations, to pay all current and future operational expenses of the Farm operations. Finally, commencing October 2017, Trava commenced making the monthly mortgage payments on the Farm, although we remain responsible for any and all “balloon payments” due under the mortgage. On a cumulative calendar monthly cash-on-cash basis, Trava is obligated to tender to us or, at our option, to either or both of our subsidiaries, an amount equivalent to 51% of the net cash for each such calendar month. Such monthly payments were on the 10th calendar day following the end of a calendar month for which such tender is required. At the end of the five-year term (assuming the exercise by Trava of each of the two above-referenced options), Trava had the unilateral right to purchase the Farm operation at a four times multiple of its EBITDA (calculated at the mean average thereof for each of the two option years).
 
In September 2017, in connection with Trava’s monthly lending to us of funds sufficient for the Farm’s monthly operational expenses of the Farm operations, we amended the MS Agreement to provide that, from time to time, Trava may exercise its rights to convert some or all of the notes that evidence its lending of funds into shares of our common stock at a fixed conversion price of $.0001. If Trava converted, in whole or in part, any one or more of such notes, then (unless (i) thereafter, we are unable to accommodate any future such conversions because of a lack of authorized, but unissued or unreserved, shares or (ii) the public market price for a share of our common stock becomes “no bid”), Trava would continue to exercise its conversion rights in respect of all of such notes (to the 4.9% limitations set forth therein) and would diligently sell the shares of common stock into which any or all of such notes may be converted (collectively, the “Underlying Shares”) in open market or other transactions (subject to any limitations imposed by the Federal securities laws and set forth in any “leak-out” type of arrangements in respect of the “underlying shares” to which Trava is a party).
 
Trava acknowledged that any proceeds derived by it from such sales of the underlying shares would, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, reduce our financial obligations under the notes. Once Trava had received sufficient proceeds from such sales to reduce our aggregate obligations thereunder to nil (which reductions shall include any and all funds that Trava may have otherwise received in connection with the respective rights and obligations of the parties to the MS Agreement), then the MS Agreement would be deemed to have been cancelled without any further economic obligations between Trava and us and Trava’s purchase right shall, accordingly, be extinguished.
 
After having earlier modified the MS Agreement through the provisions of the on-going monthly funding provided by Trava, effective as of January 29, 2018, we and Trava entered into an agreement to terminate the MS Agreement.
 
On July 11, 2019, NY – SHI and Shi Farms entered into a joint venture agreement (the “Joint Venture Agreement”) with Canbiola Inc., a Florida corporation (“Canbiola”), and NY Hemp Depot, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Canbiola Sub”). The purpose of the joint venture is to develop and implement a business model referred to as the “Depot Model” (the “Joint Venture”) to aggregate and purchase fully-grown, harvested industrial hemp from third-party farmers in the State of New York to be processed in any processing facility chosen by NY – SHI.
 
Pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement, NY – SHI and Canbiola Sub will jointly seek farmers to grow and cultivate industrial hemp in the State of New York for the Joint Venture. In addition, the Joint Venture may sell to the farmers feminized hemp seeds, clone plants, and additional materials required to grow and cultivate industrial hemp and provide to the farmers the initial training reasonably required for them to grow industrial hemp.
 
Canbiola Sub is responsible for securing the building on behalf of the Joint Venture in the State of New York to house certain of the operations of the business of the Joint Venture (the “NY Hemp Depot Facility”). Canbiola Sub will manage and direct the day-to-day operations of the Joint Venture and provide farmer recruitment services. NY – SHI is responsible for providing to the Joint Venture technical expertise regarding the growth and cultivation of industrial hemp, a license from the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets that permits the growth of industrial hemp (the “Cultivating License”), and the farmer recruitment services.
 
Upon the execution of the Joint Venture Agreement, Canbiola Sub delivered to NY – SHI a cash payment of $500,000 and, on July 22, 2019, Canbiola issued $500,000 in value of Canbiola’s common stock (12,074,089 shares) to NY – SHI. Additionally, pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement, SHI Farms has agreed, going forward, to sell certain isolate to Canbiola or its designated affiliate at the cost of processing the isolate from biomass, and granted Canbiola Sub an interest in the one and one-half percent payments due to SHI Farms in connection with its agreements with Mile High.

The “gross profits” from the Joint Venture, which are defined as gross revenues less certain direct operational costs, will be distributed quarterly in arrears with the first distribution scheduled to be made on March 31, 2020, of which 70% is to be distributed to Canbiola Sub and 30% is to be distributed to NY – SHI.
 
The Joint Venture Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, and indemnities by each of its applicable parties.
 
Through our cooperative farming program located in the Durant, Oklahoma area (through our subsidiary, Shi Cooperative, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“Shi Cooperative”)), we planted 145 acres in 2019. We utilized two separate farm plots, one representing 105 acres, the other representing 40 acres.
 
In June 2019, through Shi Cooperative, we planted five acres of outdoor feminized seed production in Reno, Nevada.
 
State and local laws regarding farming and growing hemp and processing centers for hemp vary. In December 2018, Congress passed the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, also known as the “Farm Bill,” which was then signed into law by the President. This new law contains provisions to legalize the cultivation, processing, and sale of industrial hemp. We are honing our focus to control our supply chain – from “seed to sale,” we will control our own destiny by controlling our ecosystem. We intend to oversee and execute everything from growing and cultivating the highest quality plants to managing extraction and production of our products.
 
Historically, we established joint ventures and entered into operating and management agreements with our partners and acted as a distributor of hemp products processed by our contractors. We previously generated revenue from various sources on a “one-time basis” for services that we provided to clients in helping them obtain licenses, build out and open dispensaries and cultivation centers. Prior to 2017, we sold a line of portable vaporizers and accessories under the brand name Vaporfection. We discontinued these business operations in 2016 to focus on our current business model.
 
We operate through the following subsidiaries:
 

● | Shi Farms, which cultivates and processes industrial hemp in Colorado; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | NY – SHI, which conducted our pilot study in New York and will be our joint venture partner with Canbiola and Canbiola Sub; 
● | SHI Cooperative, which contracts with third-party farmers to cultivate hemp in, among other areas, Colorado, Nevada, and Oklahoma; 
● | PASE, which owns dehydration equipment; 
● | SOCO Processing, LLC (“SOCO Processing”), a Colorado limited liability company established in May 2018 to construct a pre-processing plant as part of the Partner Farm Agreement and Supply Agreement with Mile High; and 
● | Rock Acquisition Corporation (“Rock Acquisition”), a New Jersey corporation established in December 2017, which will manage land containing potential sand and gravel assets in Pueblo, Colorado under a mining permit with the State of Colorado.

Corporate History
 
We were originally incorporated on June 16, 1977 in the State of Nevada under the name “Rabatco, Inc.” In May 2000, we changed our name to MindfulEye, Inc. On November 25, 2011, P. Vincent Mehdizadeh purchased 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. On August 30, 2011, in anticipation of the transaction discussed below, we changed our name to “Medbox, Inc.” Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement with PVM International, Inc. (“PVM”), dated December 31, 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock in various entities controlled by Mr. Mehdizadeh, in exchange for 2,000,000 shares of our common stock and a $1 million promissory note. The promissory note was repaid in full on April 16, 2013. During December 2016, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and management completed a strategic shift and completely exited the vapor and medical cannabis dispensing line. Please see Note 11, Discontinued Operations, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
 
Effective January 28, 2016, we changed our name from Medbox, Inc., to Notis Global, Inc.
 
On April 15, 2016, at a special meeting of our stockholders, stockholders holding a majority of the total shares of outstanding our common stock voted to amend our Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 400,000,000 to 10,000,000,000 (the “Certificate of Amendment”). The Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on April 18, 2016.
 
PCH Investment Group, Inc. – San Diego Project Investment
 
Effective as of March 21, 2017, through a series of related transactions, Notis intended to acquire, indirectly, an aggregate of 459,999 of the then-issued and outstanding shares of capital stock (the “PCH To-Be-Purchased Shares”) of PCH Investment Group, Inc., a California corporation (“PCH”) for a proposed purchase price of $300,000 in cash and the proposed issuance of shares of the Company’s common stock. The PCH To-Be-Purchased Shares represented 51% of the outstanding capital stock of PCH. In connection with the Company’s then-intended acquisition of the PCH To-Be-Purchased Shares, the Company (or its affiliates) was also to be granted an indirect option to acquire the remaining 49% (the “PCH Optioned Shares”) of the capital stock of PCH. The option was to expire on February 10, 2019 (the “PCH Optioned Shares Expiry Date”).
 
Located in San Diego, California, PCH was a management services business that focused on the management of cannabis production and manufacturing businesses. On November 1, 2016, PCH entered into a Management Services Agreement (the “PCH Management Agreement”) with California Cannabis Group (“CalCan”) and Devilish Delights, Inc. (“DDI”), both of which then were California nonprofit corporations in the cannabis production and manufacturing business (“their business”). CalCan and Mr. Clinton Pyatt represented that CalCan was then licensed by the City of San Diego, California, to cultivate cannabis and manufacture cannabis products, as well as to sell, at wholesale, the cultivated and manufactured products to legally operated medical marijuana dispensaries. The PCH Management Agreement provided that PCH was responsible for the day-to-day operations and business activities of their business. In that context, PCH was to be responsible for the payment of all operating expenses of their business (including the rent and related expenditures for CalCan and DDI) from the revenue generated by their business, or on an out-of- pocket basis if the revenue should be insufficient. In exchange for PCH’s services and payment obligations, PCH was to be entitled to 75% of the gross profits of their business. The PCH Management Agreement did not provide for any gross profit milestone during its first 12 months; thereafter, it provided for an annual $8 million gross profit milestone, with any amount in excess thereof to be carried forward to the next annual period. In the event that, during any annual period, the gross profit thereunder was less than $8 million (including any carry-forward amounts), then, on a one- time basis, PCH would have been permitted to carry-forward such deficit to the following annual period. If, in that following annual period, the gross profit was to have exceeded $6 million, then PCH would have been entitled to an additional “one-time basis” carry-forward of a subsequent deficit. The term of the PCH Management Agreement was for five years, subject to two extensions, each for an additional five-year period, in all cases subject to earlier termination for an uncured material breach by PCH of its obligations thereunder. Mr. Pyatt, the Company’s then- current Chief Operating Officer and Senior Vice President, Government Affairs, was also then a member of the Board of Directors of CalCan and DDI.
 
Pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, that was made and entered into as of March 16, 2017 (five days before the presumed closing of the transaction; the “SPA”), “PASE” was to have acquired the PCH To-Be-Purchased Shares from the three PCH shareholders: (i) Mystic, LLC, a California limited liability company that Mr. Goh, the Company’s then-Chief Executive Officer, formed and controlled for his investments in cannabis projects, (ii) Mr. Pyatt, and (iii) Mr. Kaller, then the general manager of PCH (collectively, the “PCH Shareholders”).

As a condition to the Lender entering into the Note Purchase Agreement and the PCH-Related Note (both as noted below) and providing any additional funding to the Company in connection with its intended acquisition of the PCH To-Be-Purchased Shares, the Company’s Board of Directors ratified the forms of employment agreements for Mr. Goh, as the Company’s then-Chief Executive Officer, and for Mr. Pyatt, as the Company’s then-prospective President. If the agreements became effective, and following the second anniversary thereof, the terms were to have become “at- will.” In addition to payment of a base salary, the agreements provided for certain cash, option, and equity bonuses, in each case to become subject both to each individual and to the Company meeting certain performance goals to be acknowledged by them and to be approved by a disinterested majority of the Company’s Board of Directors.
 
Due to the nature of the above-described intended transaction, and the related parties involved with PCH, the Company formed a special committee of its Board of Directors to consider all of the aspects thereof, as well as the related financing proposed to be provided by the Lender. The special committee consisted of three of the four directors: Ambassador Ned L. Siegel, Mitch Lowe, and Manual Flores. In the context of the special committee’s charge, it engaged an otherwise independent investment banking firm (the “Banker”) to analyze the potential acquisition of the PCH To-Be-Purchased Shares through the SPA (noted above) and the Stock Purchase Option Agreement (the “PCH Option Agreement”; the parties to which are PASE, PCH, the PCH Shareholders, as noted below), the related financing agreements (all as noted below), other related business and financial arrangements, and the above-referenced employment agreements. After the Banker completed its full review of those agreements and its own competitive analysis, it provided its opinion that the consideration to be paid in connection with the acquisition of the PCH To- Be-Purchased Shares and the terms of the PCH-Related Note were fair to the Company from a financial point of view. Following the Banker’s presentation of its analysis and opinion, and the special committee’s own analysis, the special committee unanimously recommended to the full Board of Directors that all of such transactions should be approved and that the Company could consummate the acquisition of the PCH To-Be-Purchased Shares, accept the option to acquire the PCH Optioned Shares, enter into the PCH-Related Note, the documents ancillary thereto, and the Employment Agreements.
 
In connection with the Company’s intended acquisition of the PCH To-Be-Purchased Shares and the Company’s intended option to acquire the PCH Optioned Shares, PASE, EWSD, PCH, and the Company entered into a Convertible Note Purchase Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with a third-party lender (the “PCH Lender”). Concurrently, PASE and the Company (with EWSD and PCH as co-obligors) entered into a related 10% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note (the “PCH-Related Note”) in favor of the PCH Lender. The initial principal sum under the PCH-Related Note was $1,000,000 and it bears interest at the rate of 10% per annum. Principal and interest are subject to certain conversion rights in favor of the PCH Lender. So long as any principal is outstanding or any interest remains accrued, but unpaid, at any time and from time to time, at the option of the PCH Lender, any or all of such amounts may be converted into shares of the Company’s common stock. Notwithstanding such conversion right, and except in the circumstance described in the next sentence, the PCH Lender may not exercise its conversion rights if, in so doing, it would then own more than 4.99% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. However, upon not less than 61 days’ notice, the PCH Lender may increase its limitation percentage to a maximum of 9.99%. The PCH Lender’s conversion price is fixed at $0.0001 per share. Principal and accrued interest may be pre-paid from time to time or at any time, subject to 10 days’ written notice to the PCH Lender. Any prepayment of principal or interest shall be increased to be at the rate of 130% of the amount so to be prepaid and, during the 10-day notice period, the PCH Lender may exercise its conversion rights in respect of any or all of the amounts otherwise to be prepaid.
 
In a series of other loan transactions prior to the intended closing of the acquisition of the PCH To-Be-Purchased Shares, a different third party lender (the “Ongoing Lender”) had lent to the Company, in five separate tranches, an aggregate amount of approximately $414,000 (the “Pre-acquisition Loans”), that, in turn, the Company lent to PCH to use for its working capital obligations. Upon the purported closing of the acquisition of the PCH To-Be-Purchased Shares and, pursuant to the terms of the PCH-Related Note, the PCH Lender lent to the Company (i) approximately $86,000, that, in turn, the Company lent to PCH to use for its additional working capital obligations, (ii) $300,000 for the purported acquisition of the PCH To-Be-Purchased Shares, and (iii) $90,000 for various transaction-related fees and expenses. Immediately subsequent to the closing of the purported acquisition of the PCH To-Be-Purchased Shares, the PCH Lender lent to the Company (x) approximately $170,000 for the Company’s operational obligations and (y) approximately $114,000 for the Company partially to repay an equivalent amount of the Pre-acquisition Loans.

In connection with the Pre-acquisition Loans and the PCH-Related Note, the makers and co-obligors thereof entered into an Amended and Restated Security and Pledge Agreement in favor of the Lender, pursuant to which such parties, jointly and severally, granted to the Lender a security interest in all, or substantially all, of their respective property. Further, PCH entered into a Guarantee in favor of the PCH Lender in respect of the other parties’ obligations under the PCH-Related Note. PCH’s obligation to the PCH Lender under these agreements is limited to a maximum of $500,000.
 
As of the intended closing of the acquisition of the PCH To-Be-Purchased Shares, the Company paid $300,000 to the PCH Shareholders. If that transaction had closed, the Company would also have become obligated to issue to the PCH Shareholders 1,500,000,000 shares (the “Purchase Price Shares”) of the Company’s common stock. That number of issuable shares was to be subject to certain provisions detailed in the PCH-Related Note, which are summarized herein.
 
Notwithstanding the number of issuable shares referenced above, the number of issued Purchase Price Shares was to have been equal to 15% of the then-issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock at the time that the Company exercised its option to acquire the PCH Optioned Shares under the PCH Option Agreement. Further, in the event that the Company were to have issued additional equity securities prior to the date on which it in fact had issued the Purchase Price Shares at a price per share that was less than the value referenced above, the PCH Shareholders would have been entitled to “full ratchet” anti-dilution protection in the calculation of the number of Purchase Price Shares to be issued (with the exception of a recapitalization by the Lender to reduce the Company’s overall dilution).
 
If the Company did not exercise the intended option to acquire the PCH Optioned Shares prior to PCH Optioned Shares Expiry Date, the PCH Shareholders would have had the right to reacquire the PCH To-Be-Purchased Shares from the Company for the same cash consideration ($300,000) that was to have been paid to them for those shares. Further, if the Company were to be in default of its material obligations under the SPA, or if PASE were the subject of any bankruptcy proceedings, then the PCH Shareholders have the same reacquisition rights noted in the preceding sentence.
 
Pursuant the PCH Option Agreement, PASE was granted the option to purchase all 49%, but not less than all 49%, of the PCH Optioned Shares. The exercise price for the PCH Optioned Shares is an amount equivalent to five times PCH’s “EBITDA” for the 12-calendar month period, on a look-back basis, that concludes on the date of exercise of the Option, less $10 (which was the purchase price of the option). The calculation of the 12-month EBITDA was to be determined by PASE’s (or its) then-currently engaged independent auditors. If the Company were to exercise the option prior to the first anniversary of the closing of the acquisition of the PCH To-Be-Purchased Shares, then the exercise price for the PCH Optioned Shares was to be based on the EBITDA for the entire 12-calendar month period that commenced with the effective date of the PCH Option Agreement.
 
PCH Investment Group, Inc. – San Diego Project Termination
 
On March 27, 2017, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K to announce the above-described series of events. Subsequently, it became clear to the Company that the PCH Parties failed to make key closing deliveries, including, without limitation, actual transfer of the PCH To-Be-Purchased Shares, the PCH Lease (as defined below) and related marijuana licenses. Thereafter, the parties entered into litigation and eventual settlement as described below.
The Settlement Agreement and Mutual General Release
 
The Company, PACE, and EWSD (collectively, the “Notis Parties”) and PCH, Messrs. Pyatt, Kaller, and Goh (solely in connection with his status as an equity holder of PCH, collectively, the “PCH Individuals”; and, with PCH, collectively, the “PCH Parties”) entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual General Release, with an effective date of August 16, 2017 (the “Settlement Agreement”), inter alia, to “unwind” the SPA’s intended transactions, to confirm that the transactions never officially closed, and to enter into a series of mutual releases with such parties. Some of the salient recitals from the Settlement Agreement are:

Government Regulations
 
The Farm Bill, which was signed into law in December 2018, legalizes industrial hemp cultivation and the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines. Pursuant to the Farm Bill, industrial hemp may not contain more than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Any cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3% THC would be considered non-hemp cannabis under federal law with no legal protection. In addition, state departments of agriculture must consult with the state’s governor and chief law enforcement officer to devise a plan that must be submitted to the Secretary of U.S. Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”). A state’s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once the Secretary of the USDA approves that state’s plan. In states opting not to devise a hemp regulatory program, the USDA will construct a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states must apply for licenses and comply with a federally run program. The Farm Bill also outlines actions that are considered violations of federal hemp law (including such activities as cultivating without a license or producing cannabis with more than 0.3% THC). The law details possible punishments for such violations, pathways for violators to become compliant, and even which activities qualify as felonies under the law, such as repeated offenses.

On August 11, 2016, a Statement of Principles on Industrial Hemp (the “Statement”) was issued by the Office of Secretary of the USDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), and the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) of the Department of Health and Human Service (“HHS”). On this date, Jonathan Miller, Esq., of the law firm Frost Brown Todd, in Lexington, Kentucky, and co-signed by Joseph Sandler, Esq., of the law firm Sandler Reiff Lamb Rosenstein & Birkenstock, in Washington, D.C., provided to the members of the Kentucky Hemp Industry Counsel a legal Opinion on the U.S. Federal Agency Statement of Principles. This legal opinion provided the following:
 
As we outlined comprehensively in our Opinion on the Legal Status of Industrial Hemp, dated December 21, 2015 and attached as Appendix B (“our December Opinion”), the Agricultural Act of 2014, P.L. No. 113-79 (the “2014 Farm Bill”) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY 2016 (the “Omnibus Law”) constitute a sweeping legal revolution for the industrial hemp crop. Taken together, the two laws ensure that individuals and firms that are engaged in authorized agricultural pilot programs should be permitted to grow, cultivate, transport, process, sell and/or use industrial hemp under the guidelines and regulations of state law, without interference from agencies using federally-authorized funds.
 
The issuance of the Statement of Principles by the three federal agencies most involved in these issues – the USDA, the DEA and FDA – brings that valued sense of certainty to individuals and firms involved in the industrial hemp business. Further, clarity provided by the Statement brings several items of good news to hemp farmers and firms:
 

[ ] | While initially, the DEA rejected a clear understanding of the 2014 Farm Bill that institutions of higher education and state departments of agriculture could contract out hemp pilot projects to private farmers and business – requiring us to go to federal court to clarify – the Statement clearly acknowledges that private “persons licensed, registered, or otherwise authorized” by state agriculture departments and “persons employed by or under a production contract or lease” with colleges and universities may participate in pilot programs. 
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] | Moreover, in the most welcome portion of the Statement, authorized pilot program participants “may be able to participate in USDA research or other programs to the extent otherwise eligible for participation in those programs.” We believe that this broad language for the first time opens up duly registered pilot projects to be eligible for loans, grants, certification programs, and the wide variety of other opportunities made available to farmers and agri-businesses at USDA and its sub-agencies. 
[ ] | These federal agencies also for the first time acknowledge that, as part of marketing research programs, “industrial hemp products can be sold” in or among states with pilot programs. This recognition, which reflects clear authorization by the 2014 Farm Bill and the Omnibus Law, will not only give hemp farmers and businesses confidence that they can sell their products; but perhaps more importantly, provides much needed assurance to financial institutions that such commerce is legal, and that they can facilitate financial transactions in the industry. 
[ ] | The Statement makes clear that the FDA will continue to oversee “marketing claims” and the “process for drug applications,” while the Controlled Substances Act will still apply to “the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of drug products.” Accordingly, the advice we shared in our December Opinion is confirmed: Firms engaged in producing hemp products for human consumption should not market their products as a “drug” nor make any medicinal claims without prior FDA approval. However, there are no blanket prohibitions on any other kind of sale of hemp-based consumable products such as cannabidiol (“CBD”), nor even any mention of CBD in the Statement. 

 
In addition, our subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Shi Farms, NY – SHI, and SHI Cooperative are also subject to other federal and local regulations.
 
Competition
 
Our competitors in the hemp space include sellers of products and services dedicated to the industrial hemp industry, including the cultivation, processing, and distribution of industrial hemp products. We expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the industry matures. Additionally, increased competition is possible to the extent that new states and geographies enter the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes. We believe that by diligently establishing and expanding our brands, product offerings, and services in new and existing locations, our goal is to become well established in this growing industry. Additionally, our goal is that establishing our product offerings in new and existing locations are factors that mitigate the risk associated with operating in a developing competitive environment. Our competitors may have substantially greater resources, operating experience, marketing capabilities, name recognition, and production capabilities.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had two full-time employees, none of whom is employed by us as of the date of this Annual Report. As of that date, we also had approximately nine independent contractors, three of whom are now employed by us or by one of our subsidiaries and one individual who served as our executive chair and remains in that role for us. As of November 26, 2019, we have two full-time employees and one of our subsidiaries, Shi Farms, has seven full-time employees. The number of our (and our subsidiaries’) part-time employees fluctuates over the course of a year due to the nature of our business. We also use the services of up to 20 (depending on seasonal fluctuations) independent contractors through Shi Farms. Neither we nor our subsidiaries have experienced any work stoppages and we consider the relations with their respective employees and independent contractors to be good.
Implications of Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of relief from certain reporting requirements and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

● | reduced obligations with respect to financial data, including presenting only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of selected financial data in this Report; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | an exception from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
● | reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements in our periodic reports, proxy statements, and registration statements; and 
● | exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. 

 
We may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years or such earlier time that we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, have more than $700 million in market value of our capital stock held by non-affiliates or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced reporting burdens. For example, we intend to take advantage of the reduced reporting requirements with respect to disclosure regarding our executive compensation arrangements, have presented only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure in this Report, and have taken advantage of the exemption from auditor attestation on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. To the extent that we take advantage of these reduced reporting burdens, the information that we provide stockholders may be different than you might obtain from other public companies in which you hold equity interests.
 
In addition, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
