Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 
We are an emerging over-the-counter (“OTC”) consumer goods and specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the commercialization, licensing and development of safe and effective non-prescription medicine, consumer care products, supplements and medical devices to improve men’s and women’s health and vitality. Our products currently focus in six main categories, including sexual health, pain management, general muscle health, respiratory, sleep, and diabetic care. We deliver innovative and unique health solutions of OTC medicines, devices, consumer and health products, and clinical supplements through four general channels including Direct to Consumer Marketing, E-Commerce, Retail/Wholesale, and International Distribution. Collectively these channels make up our proprietary Beyond Human® Sales & Marketing Platform which was acquired in 2016 and significantly expanded through the development of proprietary algorithms to target consumers and improve efficiency and return in 2018. We are dedicated to being a leader in developing and marketing new OTC and branded Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) products, supplements and medical devices. We are actively pursuing opportunities where existing prescription drugs have recently, or are expected to, change from prescription (or Rx) to OTC. These “Rx-to-OTC switches” require Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval through a process initiated by the New Drug Application (“NDA”) holder.
 
Our business model leverages our ability to (a) develop and build our current pipeline of proprietary products, and (b) to also acquire outright or in-license commercial products that are supported by scientific and/or clinical evidence, place them through our existing supply chain, retail and on-line (including our Amazon®, eBay®, Wish.com, Walmart.com®, and Walgreens.com on-line stores and our own product websites and platforms among other e-commerce business platforms) channels to tap new markets and drive demand for such products and to establish physician relationships. 
 
Corporate Structure
 
We are incorporated in the State of Nevada and have five wholly-owned subsidiaries including Novalere, Inc., Semprae Laboratories, Inc., FasTrak Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Supplement Hunt, Inc., and Prime Savings Club, Inc.
Our Strategy
 
Our corporate strategy focuses on three primary objectives:
 

1. | Developing a diversified product portfolio of exclusive, unique and patented non-prescription OTC and branded ANDA drugs, devices, consumer health products, and clinical supplements through: (a) the introduction of line extensions and reformulations of either our or third-party currently marketed products; (b) the development of new proprietary OTC products, supplements and devices; and (c) the acquisition of products or obtaining exclusive licensing rights to market such products;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Building an innovative, U.S. and global sales and marketing model through direct to consumer approaches such as our proprietary Beyond Human® sales and marketing platform and Supplement Hunt™ platform, the addition of new online platforms such as Amazon®, eBay®, Wish.com, Walmart.com® and Walgreens.com, through our own websites both nationally and internationally and commercial partnerships with established international complementary partners that: (a) generates revenue, and (b) requires a lower cost structure compared to traditional pharmaceutical companies, thereby increasing our gross margins; and
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. | Developing and acquiring the assets of on-line marketplaces such as Supplementhunt.com and Primesavingsclub.com that focus on certain market segments such as lower priced, soon to expire supplement business with the Supplementhunt.com asset acquisition and with the select consumer product business through Primesavingsclub.com among others in which we sell third party, brand or non-branded products.

We believe that our proven ability to market, license, acquire and develop brand name non-prescription pharmaceutical and consumer health products and devices and sell third party products on our platforms uniquely positions us to commercialize our products, expand our platforms and grow in this market in a differentiated way. The following are additional details about our strategy:
 

● | Focusing on acquisition and licensing of commercial, non-prescription pharmaceutical and consumer health products, supplements and certain related devices that are well aligned with current therapeutic areas of male and female sexual health, urology, pain, vitality, respiratory and other diseases and conditions. In general, we seek non-prescription pharmaceutical (OTC monograph, Rx to OTC ANDA switched drugs) and consumer health products, supplements and certain related devices that are already marketed with scientific and/or clinical data and evidence that are aligned with our therapeutic areas, which we then can grow and expand sales through our existing retail and online channels and commercial partners on a worldwide basis. We have done this through our acquisitions and licensing of (1) Sensum+® from Centric Research Institute or CRI, (2) Zestra® and Zestra Glide® from Semprae, (3) Vesele® from Trôphikôs, LLC, (4) U.S. and Canada rights to Androferti® from Laboratorios Q Pharma (Spain), (5) FlutiCare® from Novalere, (6) UriVarx® from Seipel Group, (7) Can-C® eye drops and supplement from International AntiAging Systems, (8) our 9 Beyond Human® supplements from Beyond Human, LLC, (9) MZS™, melatonin from International AntiAging Systems, (10) Musclin® from the University of Iowa, and (11) HealthiFeet®, ThermoMax® and BreastLift™ from Boston Topicals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increasing the number of U.S. non-exclusive distribution channel partners for print media, direct mailing and online sales. One of our goals is to increase the number of our own and third-party U.S. distribution channel partners that sell our products and make them more efficient and profitable through our proprietary consumer targeting algorithms. To do this, we have devised a three-pronged approach. First, we have developed a proprietary consumer targeting algorithm that allows us to increase our print media and direct to consumer mailings for our products. Second, we are seeking to expand the number of OTC direct selling partners, such as the larger in-store retail and wholesale distributors for selected products, and to expand sales to the more regional, statewide and local distributors, such as regional pharmacy chains, large grocery stores and supplement and health stores for selected products. Third, we are working to expand our online presence through relationships with well-known online sellers and the building of our own platforms such as established Amazon®, eBay®, Wish.com, Walmart.com® and Walgreens.com, among other stores, in addition to our own product websites; 
● | Developing or acquiring products or developing or acquiring proprietary product ingredients that may prove to be more profitable in the long run for the Company. We are currently exploring the acquisition and development of proprietary product ingredients that we can use to develop our own products through our various channels and to sell product ingredients to third parties that they can use to develop their own products; 
● | Seeking commercial partnerships outside the U.S. and developing consistent international commercial and distribution systems. We seek to develop a strong network of international distribution partners outside of the U.S. To do so, we are relying in part on past relationships that Dr. Bassam Damaj, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has developed with certain commercial partners globally. In addition, we believe we have the ability to develop new relationships with commercial distributors who can demonstrate they have leading positions in their regions and can provide us with effective marketing and sales efforts and teams to introduce our products to physicians and therapists. Our commercial partners outside the U.S. are responsible for storing, distributing and promoting our products to physicians, urologists, gynecologists, therapists and to other healthcare providers. We currently have 12 active commercial partnerships covering our products in 45 countries outside the U.S.; 
● | Developing our own proprietary products and a proprietary patent and trademark portfolio to protect the therapeutic products and categories we desire to enter. We have developed certain of our products ourselves, such as Apeaz® for arthritis pain, Xyralid® for hemorrhoids and Diabasens®, a diabetic foot cream. We have filed and are working to secure patent claims in the U.S. and abroad covering product inventions and innovations that we believe are valuable. These patents, if issued and ultimately found to be valid, may enable us to create a barrier to entry for competitors on a worldwide basis. To date, we have 4 issued U.S. patents, 12 U.S. patent applications, 12 foreign patents, and 10 foreign patent applications. We also currently have 33 U.S. trademark registrations, 38 U.S. trademark applications, 50 foreign trademark registrations and 47 foreign trademark applications; 
● | Achieving cost economies of scale from lower-cost manufacturing, integrated distribution channels and multiple product discounts. We believe that we can achieve higher gross margins per product by shifting manufacturing to lower cost manufacturers. We also feel that we can acquire other OTC and consumer healthcare products and reintroduce them into our networks and sales and marketing platforms utilizing our integrated distribution and direct to consumer channels, thus receiving multiple product economies of scale from our distribution partners; and 
● | Building or acquiring additional on-line marketplaces for our and third party products. We believe that we can achieve higher profit margins from building our own or purchasing niche on-line marketplaces that can achieve relatively high gross margins and be profitable over the long run.

Our Products
 
Marketed Products
 
We currently market and sell over 35 products in the U.S. and more than 10 in multiple countries around the world through our 12 international commercial partners.  We currently have seven core products which we define as recognizing more than $1.0 million in annual sales or projected to recognize more than $1.0 million in sales over the next twelve months.  The following represents these core products:

1. | Vesele®; 
---+-----------------
2. | UriVarx®; 
3. | FlutiCare®; 
4. | Apeaz®; 
5. | Diabasens®; 
6. | Prostagorx®; and
7. | Sensum®. 

 
 In addition, we currently expect to launch the following products in the U.S. in 2019, subject to the applicable regulatory approvals, if required:
 

1. | ThermoMax® is a hand cream with two strengths that provides up to eight hours of hand warming relief (second quarter of 2019); 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | BreastLift™ is a clinically tested cream to provide safe and natural way to firm sagging breasts (second quarter of 2019); 
3. | HealthiFeet® is a foot cream that provides foot warming relief (second quarter of 2019); 
4. | MZS Sleeping Aid™ with Hemp-Derived THC-free oil and melatonin and is in tincture form (launched in first quarter of 2019); 
5. | Trexar™ is a supplement to provide enhanced sensation (second quarter of 2019); 
6. | Musclin® is a proprietary supplement made of two FDA Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) approved ingredients designed to increase muscle mass, endurance and activity (second half of 2019). The main ingredient in Musclin® is a natural activator of the transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 3 (TRPV3) channels on muscle fibers responsible to increase fibers width resulting in larger muscles; 
7. | Regenerum™ is a proprietary product containing two natural molecules; the first is an activator of the TRPV3 channels resulting in the increase of muscle fiber width, and the second targets a different unknown receptor to build the muscle’s capacity for energy production and increases physical endurance, allowing longer and more intense exercise. Regenerum™ is being developed for patients suffering from muscle wasting. We currently expect to launch this product in 2020 pending successful clinical trials in patients with muscle wasting or cachexia; and 
8. | Octiq™ is an expected FDA ophthalmic OTC monograph compliant product for the treatment of eye redness and eye lubrication (late 2019/early 2020). 

 
In addition to the above product pipeline, we currently intend to license and acquire other products that we may launch in 2019.
 
Sales and Marketing Channels
 
As discussed, we currently have four main sales and marketing channels making up the Beyond Human® sales and marketing platform acquired in March 2016, which has resulted in the significant revenue growth to $24.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with $8.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. We feel that these channels complement each other to enhance the Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. brand and awareness of our customers and provide us with the ability to use our sales and marketing in the most efficient way possible in acquiring new customers and maintaining those current customers for longer periods of time.
Print and Direct Mail Marketing
 
Through our Beyond Human® sales and marketing platform, we have access to advertise in the vast majority of newspapers and magazines on a regular basis. We have developed our own proprietary algorithms that allow us to target customers looking for specific health products allowing us to increase the return on our investment and reduce the cost to acquire new customers. During 2018, we have been able to expand our reach to Canada with the approval of twelve of our products by Health Canada and successfully expand our Beyond Human® sales and marketing platform.
 
E-Commerce
 
We have an extensive number of on-line channels through our Amazon®, NewEgg®, Walmart.com®, eBay®, Wish.com and Walgreens.com sites in addition to our own InnovusPharma.com site along with sites for each of our products individually. Our expertise allows us to successfully drive product sales through proper marketing campaigns through third party sites as well as through email marketing campaigns to increase traffic to our own sites. Additionally, we have recognized that maintaining a proper e-commerce presence allows those customers who read our advertisements in the newspapers and magazine or receive our direct mail another avenue to purchase products. We also have acquired additional on-line marketplaces such as Supplementhunt.com and Primesavingsclub.com that allow us to expand the number of products that we sell through our e-commerce channels.
 
 -4-


Retail/Wholesale
 
We are continuously introducing our products to varieties of retail and wholesale partners to enhance the brand and product awareness for our customers. In 2018, we significantly increased our advertising expenses specifically in the Print and Direct Mail Marketing channel which, in turn, has had a direct positive impact to the success of products in retail. We intend to continue to demonstrate to our retail and wholesale partners the advantages of incorporating our products in their stores especially due to our proprietary consumer targeted marketing approach that our print advertising and e-commerce business allows us to achieve.
 
International Distribution
 
We continue to work with our exclusive commercial partners outside of the U.S. that would be responsible for sales and marketing in those territories. We evaluate the performance of each of these partners to ensure a steady flow of consumer activity for each of our products. Our strategy outside the U.S. is to partner with companies who can effectively market and sell our products in their countries through their direct marketing and sales teams. The strategy of using our partners to commercialize our products is designed to limit our expenses and fix our cost structure, enabling us to increase our reach while minimizing our incremental spending.
Manufacturers and Single Source Suppliers
 
We use third-party manufacturers for the production of our products for development and commercial purposes. We believe there is currently excess capacity for manufacturing in the marketplace and opportunities to lower manufacturing cost through outsourcing to regions and countries that can do it in a more cost-effective basis. We currently have multiple contract manufacturers for our multiple products, and we issue purchase orders to these suppliers each time we require replenishment of our product inventory. All of our current manufacturers are based in the U.S. except for two based in Italy and we are looking to establish contract manufacturing for certain of our products in Europe, the Middle East and Northern Africa regions to reduce the cost and risk of supply chain to our current and potential commercial partners in their territories.
Government Regulation
 
Our products are normally subject to regulatory approval or must comply with various U.S. and international regulatory and advertisement requirements. Unlike pharmaceutical companies who primarily sell prescription products, we currently sell drug or health products into the OTC market. While prescription products normally must progress from pre-clinical to clinical to FDA approval and then can be marketed and sold, our products are normally subject to conformity to FDA monograph requirements and similar requirements in other countries, which requires a shorter time frame for us to satisfy regulatory requirements and permits us to begin commercialization.
 
Below is a brief description of the FDA regulatory process for our products in the U.S.
 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
 
The FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, labeling, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drug products. These agencies regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of our product candidates. The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy and expensive, with no guarantee of a positive result. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunctive relief including partial or total suspension of production, or withdrawal of a product from the market.
 
The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, manufacture, promotion and distribution of drugs in the U.S. under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the (“FFDCA”), and other statutes and implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before prescription drug product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
 

● | Completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
● | For some products, performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s regulations, including Good Clinical Practices, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
● | Submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA; 
● | Submission to the FDA of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA; 
● | Satisfactory completion of an FDA preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations; and 
● | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug. 

 
 -5-


The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals and other animal studies. The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after an IND is submitted. The IND also includes one or more protocols for the initial clinical trial or trials and an investigator’s brochure. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before any clinical trials can begin. Clinical trial holds also may be imposed at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements. An independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each of the clinical centers proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the consent form signed by the trial participants and must monitor the study until completed.
 
Abbreviated New Drug Application
 
An ANDA contains data which when submitted to FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Office of Generic Drugs, provides for the review and ultimate approval of a generic drug product. Once approved, an applicant may manufacture and market the generic drug product to provide a safe, effective, low cost alternative to the public than a bioequivalent prescription product.
 
A generic drug product is one that is comparable to an innovator drug product in dosage form, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use.  Generic drug applications are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and effectiveness. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent (i.e., performs in the same manner as the innovator drug). One-way scientists demonstrate bioequivalence is to measure the time it takes the generic drug to reach the bloodstream in 24 to 36 healthy, volunteers. This gives them the rate of absorption, or bioavailability, of the generic drug, which they can then compare to that of the innovator drug.  The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a patient’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug.   
 
Using bioequivalence as the basis for approving generic copies of drug products was established by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Waxman-Hatch Act. This Act expedites the availability of less costly generic drugs by permitting FDA to approve applications to market generic versions of brand-name drugs without conducting costly and duplicative clinical trials. At the same time, the Act granted companies the ability to apply for up to five additional years of patent protection for the innovator drugs developed to make up for time lost while their products were going through the FDA’s approval process. Brand-name drugs are subject to the same bioequivalence tests as generics upon reformulation.
 
Bioequivalence Studies
 
Studies to measure bioavailability and/or establish bioequivalence of a product are important elements in support of investigational new drug applications, or INDs, new drug applications, or NDAs, ANDAs and their supplements. As part of INDs and NDAs for orally administered drug products, bioavailability studies focus on determining the process by which a drug is released from the oral dosage form and moves to the site of action. Bioavailability data provides an estimate of the fraction of the drug absorbed, as well as its subsequent distribution and elimination. Bioavailability can be generally documented by a systemic exposure profile obtained by measuring drug and/or metabolite concentration in the systemic circulation over time. The systemic exposure profile determined during clinical trials in the IND period can serve as a benchmark for subsequent bioequivalence studies. Studies to establish bioequivalence between two products are important for certain changes before approval for a pioneer product in NDA and ANDA submissions and in the presence of certain post-approval changes in NDAs and ANDAs. In bioequivalence studies, an applicant compares the systemic exposure profile of a test drug product to that of a reference drug product. For two orally or intra-nasally administered drug products to be bioequivalent, the active drug ingredient or active moiety in the test product must exhibit the same rate. 
OTC Monograph Process
 
The FDA regulates certain non-prescription drugs using an OTC Monograph product designation which, when final, is published in the Code of Federal Regulations at 21 C.F.R. Parts 330-358. Such products that meet each of the conditions established in the OTC Monograph regulations, as well as all other applicable regulations, may be marketed without prior approval by the FDA.
 
The general conditions set forth for OTC Monograph products include, among other things:
 

● | The product is manufactured at FDA registered establishments and in accordance with cGMPs; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The product label meets applicable format and content requirements including permissible “Indications” and all required dosing instructions and limitations, warnings, precautions and contraindications that have been established in an applicable OTC Monograph;
● | The product contains only permissible active ingredients in permissible strengths and dosage forms; 
● | The product contains only suitable inactive ingredients which are safe in the amounts administered and do not interfere with the effectiveness of the preparation; and 
● | The product container and container components meet FDA’s requirements. 

 
The advertising for OTC drug products is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, which generally requires that advertising claims be truthful, not misleading, and substantiated by adequate and reliable scientific evidence. False, misleading or unsubstantiated OTC drug advertising may be subject to FTC enforcement action and may also be challenged in court by competitors or others under the federal Lanham Act or similar state laws. Penalties for false or misleading advertising may include monetary fines or judgments as well as injunctions against further dissemination of such advertising claims.
 
A product marketed pursuant to an OTC Monograph must be listed with the FDA’s Drug Regulation and Listing System and have a National Drug Code listing, which is required for all marketed drug products. After marketing, the FDA may test the product or otherwise investigate the manufacturing and development of the product to ensure compliance with the OTC Monograph. Should the FDA determine that a product is not marketed in compliance with the OTC Monograph or is advertised outside of its regulations, the FDA may require corrective action up to and including market withdrawal and recall.

Federal Trade Commission/State and County Attorney Generals
 
With respect to FTC matters, if the FTC has reason to believe the law is being violated (e.g. failure to possess adequate substantiation for product claims), it can initiate an enforcement action. The FTC has a variety of processes and remedies available to it for enforcement, both administratively and judicially, including compulsory process authority, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement could result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, consumer redress, divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, or such other relief as may be deemed necessary. Violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Any action against us by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products.
 
In addition, we may be subject, from time to time, to state and county attorneys general regulations, administrative actions and enforcement proceedings that attempt to protect the public in their states and jurisdictions from untrue claims by various supplement or other products.
 
Other Regulatory Requirements
 
Maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and international statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Drug manufacturers are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and, after approval, the FDA and these state agencies conduct periodic unannounced inspections to ensure continued compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs. In addition, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. The FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance programs to monitor safety and the effectiveness of approved products that have been commercialized. Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including:

● | Meeting record-keeping requirements; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------
● | Reporting of adverse experiences with the drug; 
● | Providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;
● | Reporting on advertisements and promotional labeling; 
● | Drug sampling and distribution requirements; and 
● | Complying with electronic record and signature requirements. 

 
In addition, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. There are numerous regulations and policies that govern various means for disseminating information to health-care professionals as well as consumers, including to industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, information provided to the media and information provided over the Internet. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
 
The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and the failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us or on the manufacturers and distributors of our approved products, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution and disgorgement of profit, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approvals, refusal to approve pending applications and criminal prosecution resulting in fines and incarceration. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label or unapproved uses may be subject to significant liability. In addition, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
 
Competition
 
The OTC pharmaceutical market is highly competitive with many established manufacturers, suppliers and distributors that are actively engaged in all phases of the business. We believe that competition in the sale of our products will be based primarily on efficacy, regulatory compliance, brand awareness, availability, product safety and price. Our brand name OTC pharmaceutical products may be subject to competition from alternate therapies during the period of patent protection and thereafter from generic or other competitive products. All of our existing products, and products we have agreements to acquire, compete with generic and other competitive products in the marketplace.
 
Competing in the branded product business requires us to identify and quickly bring to market new products embodying technological innovations. Successful marketing of branded products depends primarily on the ability to communicate the efficacy, safety and value to healthcare professionals in private practice, group practices and managed care organizations. We anticipate that our branded product offerings will support our existing lines of therapeutic focus. Based upon business conditions and other factors, we regularly reexamine our business strategies and may from time to time reallocate our resources from one therapeutic area to another, withdraw from a therapeutic area or add an additional therapeutic area in order to maximize our overall growth opportunities.
 
Some of our existing products, and products we have agreements to acquire, compete with one or more products marketed by very large pharmaceutical companies that have much greater financial resources for marketing, selling and developing their products. These competitors, as well as others, have been in business for a longer period of time, have a greater number of products on the market and have greater financial and other resources than we do. If we directly compete with them for the same markets and/or products, their financial and market strength could prevent us from capturing a meaningful share of those markets.
 
We also compete with other OTC pharmaceutical companies for product line acquisitions as well as for new products and acquisitions of other companies.
 
Research and Development
 
We have used outside contract research organizations to carry out our research and development activities. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred research and development costs totaling $160,000 and $39,000, respectively. The increase was a result in additional research of new products, quality testing of products, and additional clinical trials expense incurred in 2018 primarily related to Musclin®.
