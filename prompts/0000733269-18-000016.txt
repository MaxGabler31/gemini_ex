Acxiom is a Delaware corporation founded in 1969 in Conway, Arkansas.

Across these segments, we leverage a common set of technical capabilities, each of which delivers increasing value with scale.  We provide the largest number of integrations to marketing platforms and data providers in the digital marketing ecosystem, enabling our clients to innovate through their preferred choice of technology, data, and services providers.

Together, our products and services form the “power grid” for data, the critical foundation for people-based marketing that brands need to engage consumers across today’s highly fragmented landscape of channels and devices.

Industry Trends

Overwhelming Complexity in Digital Marketing Ecosystem

Marketing has evolved significantly in recent years driven by rapid innovation and an explosion of data, channels, devices, and applications. Historically, brands interacted with consumers through a limited number of channels, with limited visibility into the activities taking place. Today, companies interact with consumers across a growing number of touchpoints, including online, social, mobile and point-of-sale. The billions of interactions that take place each day between brands and consumers create a trove of valuable data that can be collected and analyzed. However, most companies are unable to cut through the complexity to effectively harness and leverage this data.
Increasing Fragmentation

Today, customer journeys span multiple channels and devices over time, resulting in data silos and fragmented identities. As consumers engage with brands across various touchpoints – over the web, mobile devices and applications, by email and television, and in physical stores – they may not be represented as single unique individuals with complex behaviors, appearing instead as disparate data points with dozens of different identifiers. Becky Smith who lives at 123 Main Street may appear as beckys@acme.com when she uses Facebook, becky@yahoo.com when she signs into Yahoo Finance, cookie 123 when she browses msn.com, cookie ABC when 
7

she browses aol.com, and so on. As a result, marketers struggle to understand the cross-channel, cross-device habits of consumers and the different steps they take on their path to conversion. More specifically, data silos and fragmented identities prevent brands from being able to resolve all relevant data to a specific individual; this poses a challenge to formation of accurate, actionable insights about a brand’s consumers or campaigns.

Marketing Waste

Every day, brands spend billions of dollars on advertising and marketing, yet many of the messages they deliver are irrelevant, repetitive, mistimed, or simply reach the wrong audience. In addition, as the marketing landscape continues to grow and splinter across a growing array of online and offline channels, it is increasingly difficult to attribute marketing spend to a measurable outcome, such as an in-store visit or sale. Wasted marketing spend is largely driven by the fragmented ecosystem of brands, data providers, marketing applications, media providers, and agencies that are involved in the marketing process, but operate without cohesion. Without a common understanding of consumer identity to unify otherwise siloed data, brands are unable to define accurate audience segments and derive insights that would enable better decision making.
Heightened Privacy and Security Concerns

Diligence in the areas of consumer privacy and security is and will continue to be paramount. Consumer understanding of the benefits of marketing technology often lags the pace of innovation, inspiring new demands from government agencies and consumer advocacy groups across the world. These factors compound the liability every company faces when managing and activating consumer data.
The New Era of People-Based Marketing

Historically, marketers were forced to cast a wide net to reach a desired audience. They might, for example, have run a television commercial during a specific program or placed generic advertising alongside certain types of web content, often exposing their message to millions of consumers outside their target audience. Today, however, rich data opens the door to granular audience targeting and better, more engaging customer experiences. For example, digital publishers like Facebook and Twitter now provide marketers with the ability to target very specific audiences – males, over the age of 30, who live in zip code 94123, and own pets, for instance.

Consumers are demanding personalization, and every piece of marketing content served has the potential to be individually relevant, addressable, and measurable. By understanding which devices, email addresses, and postal addresses relate to the same individual, marketers can deliver seamless experiences as consumers engage a brand across touchpoints. At the same time, by targeting consumers at the individual level, organizations can reduce marketing waste and more easily attribute their marketing spend to actual results.

People-Based Marketing is Complex and Challenging to Navigate

Innovation has fueled the growth of a highly-fragmented technology landscape, forcing brands to contend with thousands of marketing technologies and data silos. To make every customer experience relevant across channels and devices, organizations need a data foundation and common network that can break down those silos, make data portable, and accurately recognize people throughout the customer journey. Marketing is becoming more audience-centric, automated, and optimized. However, a number of important factors make people-based marketing in the digital era complex and challenging to navigate:


• | Recognition. For organizations to target audiences at the individual level, they must be able to recognize consumers across all channels and devices, and link multiple identifiers and data elements back to a persistent identifier to create a single view of the customer.


• | Scaled Data Assets. Quality, depth, and recency of data matters when deriving linkages between identifiers. Organizations must have access to an extensive set of data and be able to match that data with a high degree of accuracy to perform true cross-device audience targeting.


• | Integrations. The fragmented marketing landscape creates a need for a common network of integrations that make it easy and safe to match and activate data anywhere in the ecosystem.

8


• | Walled Gardens. Walled gardens, or marketing platforms that restrict the use of data outside of their walls, are becoming more pervasive and can result in loss of control, lack of transparency, and fragmented brand experiences. Organizations need a solution that enables an open ecosystem and ensures complete control over customer data, along with the flexibility to choose a diversified approach to meeting marketing goals.


• | Big Data Challenges. The volume of data available to optimize marketing performance is enormous and continues to grow. Organizations will continue to struggle with the management, activation, retrieval, and ability to unify data across channels and formats.


• | Privacy and Compliance. Preserving brand integrity and delivering positive customer experiences is a top priority for every marketer. Organizations must be able to manage large sets of complex data ethically, securely, within legal boundaries, and in a way that protects consumers.


• | Technical Expertise. Organizing, managing, and deriving insight from large sets of consumer data is complicated. Consequently, brands must rely on technical expertise and know-how in the form of third-party services to remove the barriers to effectively managing their data and leveraging its full value.

Acxiom: Solutions That Power People-Based Marketing

Our products and services provide the data foundation brands need to power people-based marketing. We make it safe and easy to activate, validate, enhance, and unify data, enabling marketers to deliver relevant messages at scale and link their campaigns to actual results. We help our clients generate higher return on investment and drive better customer interactions and experiences.

As noted above, Acxiom has three business segments, each helping our clients address the inherent challenges associated with people-based marketing in a digital era. During fiscal 2018, we undertook a comprehensive review of our businesses to drive cleaner lines of sight, to create clearer accountabilities and to maximize its strategic flexibility. Following this review, we intend to reorganize our business and actively explore options to further strengthen Acxiom Marketing Solutions, a segment combining Marketing Services and lines of business from Audience Solutions. Beginning in fiscal 2019, we will report our results in two business segments: LiveRamp and Acxiom Marketing Solutions.

Connectivity

As shown in the illustration below, our Connectivity segment enables our clients to build an omni-channel view of the customer and activate that understanding across the marketing ecosystem.
Through integrations with more than 575 leading digital marketing platforms and data providers, we have become a key point of entry into the digital ecosystem, helping our clients eliminate data silos and unlock greater value from the marketing tools they use every day. We provide a foundational identity resolution layer enabling our clients to identify and reach consumers across channels and measure the impact of marketing on sales, using the marketing platform of their choice.

Today, our primary Connectivity offering is LiveRamp® IdentityLink™, an identity resolution service that ties data back to real people and makes it possible to onboard that data for people-based marketing initiatives across digital channels. Leveraging AbiliTec® and the LiveRamp identity graph, IdentityLink first resolves a client’s first-, second-, and third-party, exposure, and transaction data to persistent anonymous consumer identifiers that represent real 
9

people in a privacy-safe way. This omni-channel view of the consumer can then be onboarded to and between any of the 575 plus partners in our ecosystem to support targeting, personalization and measurement use cases.

Targeting | Personalization | Measurement 
Example | Example | Example 
Clients can upload known data from first-, second-, and third-party data sources, resolve it to an omnichannel privacy-safe link with IdentityLink, then onboard to one of 575+ LiveRamp partners to deploy targeted ads to known customers. | Clients can deliver highly relevant content the moment viewers visit their websites' landing page, no login required. Leveraging IdentityLink, clients can resolve customer segment data to devices and digital IDs, onboard that data to a personalization platform and provide one-to-one experiences without compromising user privacy. | Clients can connect exposure data with first and third-party purchase data across channels by resolving all customer devices back to the customers to which they belong. Then, clients can onboard that data to a measurement platform to clearly establish cause, effect and impact.


IdentityLink operates in an Acxiom SafeHaven® certified environment with technical, operational, and personnel controls designed to ensure our clients’ data is kept private and secure.

IdentityLink is sold to brands and the companies' brands partners to execute their marketing including marketing technology providers, data providers, publishers and agencies.


• | IdentityLink for Brands and Agencies. IdentityLink allows brands and their agencies to execute people-based marketing by creating an omni-channel understanding of the consumer and activating that understanding across their choice of best-of-breed digital marketing platforms.


• | IdentityLink for Marketing Technology Providers. IdentityLink provides marketing technology providers with the ability to offer people-based targeting, measurement and personalization within their platforms. This adds value for brands by increasing reach, as well as the speed at which they can activate their marketing data.


• | IdentityLink for Data Owners. IdentityLink allows data owners to easily connect their data to the digital ecosystem and better monetize it. Data can be distributed to clients or made available through the IdentityLink Data Store feature. This adds value for brands as it allows them to augment their understanding of consumers, and increase both their reach against and understanding of customers and prospects.


• | IdentityLink for Publishers. IdentityLink allows publishers to offer people-based marketing on their properties. This adds value for brands by providing direct access to their customers and prospects in the publisher’s premium inventory.

Audience Solutions

Our Audience Solutions segment helps clients validate the accuracy of their data, enhance it with additional insight, and keep it up to date, enabling clients to reach desired audiences with highly relevant messages. Leveraging our recognition and data assets, clients can identify, segment, and differentiate their audiences for more effective marketing and superior customer experiences. Audience Solutions’ offerings include InfoBase®, our large 
10

consumer data store that serves as the basis for Acxiom’s consumer demographics products, and AbiliTec, our patented identity resolution technology that assists our clients in reconciling and managing variations of customer identity over time and across multiple channels.


• | InfoBase.® With more than 1,500 demographic, socio-economic and lifestyle data elements and several thousand predictive models, our InfoBase products provide marketers with the ability to identify and reach the right audience with the right message across both traditional and digital channels. Through partnerships with over 100 online publishers and digital marketing platforms, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, 4INFO, AOL, eBay and MSN, marketers can use InfoBase data to create and target specific audiences. Data can be accessed directly or through the Acxiom Audience Cloud, a web-based, self-service tool that makes it easy to build and distribute third-party custom data segments.


• | AbiliTec.® As shown in the illustration below, AbiliTec helps brands recognize individuals and households using a number of different input variables and connect identities online and offline.


By identifying and linking multiple identifiers and data elements back to a persistent ID, our clients are able to create a single view of the customer, which allows them to perform more effective audience targeting and deliver better, more relevant customer experiences.
Marketing Services

Our Marketing Services segment helps clients unify data at the individual level in a privacy-safe environment, so they can execute people-based marketing campaigns, tie back to real results, and drive a continual cycle of optimization. We help architect the foundation for data-driven marketing by delivering solutions that integrate customer and prospect data across the enterprise, thereby enabling our clients to establish a single view of the customer. We also support our clients in navigating the complexities of consumer privacy regulation, making it easy and safe for them to use innovative technology, maintain choice in channels and media, and stay agile in this competitive era of the consumer. These services allow our clients to generate higher return on marketing investments and, at the same time, drive better, more relevant customer experiences.
Our Marketing Services segment includes the following service offerings: Marketing Database Services and Strategy and Analytics. The Marketing Services segment also included Impact Email Platform and Services until the disposition of the business in August 2016.

• | Marketing Database Services. Our Marketing Database offering provides solutions that unify consumer data across an enterprise, enabling clients to execute relevant, people-based marketing and activate data across the marketing ecosystem. Our consumer marketing databases, which we design, build, and manage for our clients, make it possible for clients to collect and analyze information from all sources, thereby increasing customer acquisition, retention, and loyalty. Through our growing partner network, clients are able to integrate their data with best-of-breed marketing solutions while respecting and protecting consumer privacy.


• | Strategy and Analytics. Our Strategy and Analytics group consists of marketing strategists and data scientists who leverage industry knowledge and advanced analytics to assist our clients with identifying growth opportunities, addressing marketing data and technology needs, and adopting best practices. In addition, we help our clients identify and address their data privacy and governance requirements.

Together, our products and services form the “power grid” for data, the critical foundation for people-based marketing that brands need to engage consumers across today's highly fragmented landscape of channels and devices. 
We provide integrations with the largest number of marketing platforms and data providers in the digital marketing ecosystem, enabling our clients to innovate through their preferred choice of technology, data, and services providers. Our industry-leading recognition and data assets power best-in-class consumer identification and linking across channels and devices.

• | Standard Bearer for Privacy and Security. For more than 45 years, Acxiom has been a leader in the area of data stewardship, as evidenced by:


◦ | The industry's first Chief Privacy Officer role created in 1991 whose sole focus is the protection and responsible use of consumer data


◦ | The use of a data SafeHaven®, a privacy-compliant environment that allows marketers and partners to connect different types of data while protecting and governing its use

Growth Strategy

While the terms “big data” and “data management platforms,” or “DMPs,” have recently become more common, for more than 45 years, Acxiom has been a thought leader and innovator in solving large-scale data problems and improving marketing results for our clients. Key elements of our growth strategy include:

• | Continue to Innovate and Extend Leadership Position in Data Connectivity. We intend to continue to make substantial investments in our Connectivity solutions and extend our market leadership through innovation. Our investments will focus on automation, speed, higher match rates, expanded partner integrations, and new product development.


• | Establish the Standard for Recognition and User Identification in the Marketing Ecosystem. We intend to establish AbiliTec as the standard for consumer-level recognition across the marketing ecosystem, providing a single source for user identification and audience targeting.


• | Continue to Grow Our Client Base and Expand Existing Client Relationships. We plan to acquire an increasing number of new customers through the expansion of our direct sales teams. In addition, we intend to increase revenue from existing customers, many of whom are new Connectivity customers who have data infrastructure needs our Audience Solutions and Marketing Services businesses can help address.


• | Expand Global Presence. We believe significant opportunities exist for us to expand our Connectivity offerings in key geographic markets where we already operate, such as Europe, China, Japan, and Australia. We intend to leverage existing infrastructure and expand operations to launch and grow our Connectivity business in those key markets.


• | Build an Enduring Business. We do not aspire to be mediocre, good, or even great - we intend to be the absolute best in everything we do. We employ exceptional people, challenge them to accomplish exceptional things, and achieve exceptional results for our clients and shareholders. We will do this through five guiding principles: 1) Above all, we do what is right; 2) We always say what we mean, and do what we say; 3) We empower people; 4) We respect people and time; and 5) We get stuff done. 

Privacy Considerations

The growing online advertising and e-commerce industries are converging, with consumers expecting a seamless experience across all channels, in real time.   This challenges marketing organizations to balance the deluge of data and demands of the consumer with responsible, privacy-compliant methods of managing data internally and with advertising technology intermediaries. 

We have policies and operational practices governing Acxiom’s use of data that we believe reflect leading best practices and actively promote a set of effective privacy guidelines for digital advertising and direct marketing via all channels of addressable media, e-commerce, risk management and information industries as a whole.  We remain certified under the European Union (“EU”)-U.S. Safe Harbor and are preparing for its potential replacement, the EU-US Privacy Shield.  We also are operating as applicable under EU model contract clauses and contractually comply with other international data protection requirements in an effort to ensure our continued ability to process information across borders. We have a dedicated team in place to oversee our compliance with the privacy regulations that govern our business activities in the various countries in which we operate. 

The U.S. Congress continues to debate privacy legislation, and there are many different types of privacy legislation pending at the state level. In all of the non-U.S. locations in which we do business, laws and regulations governing the collection and use of personal data either exist or are being contemplated.

We expect the trend of enacting and revising data protection laws to continue and that new and expanded privacy legislation in various forms will be implemented in the U.S. and in other countries around the globe.  We are 
13

supportive of legislation that codifies the current industry guidelines of meaningful transparency for the individual and appropriate choices regarding whether information related to that individual is shared with independent third parties for marketing purposes. We also support legislation requiring all custodians of sensitive information to deploy reasonable information security safeguards to protect that information.

Clients

Our client base consists primarily of Fortune 1000 companies and organizations in the financial services, insurance, information services, direct marketing, retail, consumer packaged goods, technology, automotive, healthcare, travel and communications industries as well as in non-profit and government sectors.  We seek to maintain long-term relationships with our clients, many of which typically operate under contracts with initial terms of at least two years.  We have historically experienced high retention rates among our clients.

Our ten largest clients represented approximately 36% of our revenues in fiscal year 2018 but no single client accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues.   

Sales and Marketing

The process of buying marketing services has become more complex and therefore requires a more collaborative decision process between client and provider.  As such, our approach to sales and marketing is strategy-led and client-intimate.  Utilizing a proprietary maturity model, we employ both a diagnostic approach, guided by gaps between a client’s current and desired state, and a prescriptive approach, focused on proven solutions and approaches to close those gaps.

Our sales teams focus on new business development across all markets – sales to new clients and sales of new lines of business to existing clients, as well as revenue growth within existing accounts.  We organize our client relationships around industry verticals, as we believe that understanding and speaking to the nuances of each industry is the most effective way to positively impact our clients’ businesses.
Our partner organization focuses on enabling key media partners, agencies and software providers who can help drive value for our clients or who benefit from using Acxiom for data, analytics and audience management.

The focus of our marketing efforts is to disseminate our thought leadership.  We do this by promoting topical points of view across multiple touch points and by fueling our sales efforts with prescriptive insights.

Research and Development

Research and development expense was $94.9 million in fiscal 2018, compared to $82.1 million in fiscal 2017, and $74.2 million in fiscal 2016.  Management expects to maintain investment spending at similar levels in fiscal 2019.
Competition

Competitors for our Connectivity services are typically also members of our partner ecosystem, creating a paradigm where competition is the norm. Our primary competitors are companies that sell data onboarding as part of a suite of marketing applications or services. Walled gardens that offer a direct interface for matching CRM data compete for a portion of our services, particularly amongst marketers that have not yet adopted in-house platforms for programmatic marketing or attribution. Some providers of tag management, data management, and cross-device marketing solutions have adopted positioning similar to our Connectivity business and compete for mindshare. 

Our traditional competitors for our Audience Solutions and Marketing Services offerings have been database marketing services providers. We find that the competitive landscape is becoming more complex and now includes a range of players. Our primary competitors tend to be database marketing services providers, data companies and data distributors. In-house IT departments provide a secondary source of competition for portions of our offerings. Other types of companies such as technology consultants, business process outsourcers, analytics consultants, and management consultants participate to a lesser extent in portions of our market space.

Different types of competitors have different core competencies and assets that they bring to bear. We compete for both broad-based and specific solutions. Our competitors can vary depending on the type of solution we are competing for. Generally, competition is based on the quality and reliability of the offering, whether the strategy will 
14

deliver the desired business results for the client, historical success and market presence. Competition for more granular offerings is based on variables that are more specific. With regard to data products, for example, we compete with two types of firms: data providers and list providers. Competition is based on the quality and comprehensiveness of the information provided, the ability to deliver the information in products and formats that our clients need, and, to a lesser extent, pricing.

In markets outside the United States, we face both global players as well as local market players. Local market players vary between those offering a range of services and those who may compete with us in more limited areas, such as for data products or data integration services.

We continue to focus on levers to increase our competitiveness and believe that investing in the product and technology platform of our business is a key to our continued success. Further, we believe that enabling a broad partner ecosystem will help us to continue to provide competitive differentiation.

Seasonality and Inflation

Although we cannot accurately determine the amounts attributable to inflation, we are affected by inflation through increased costs of compensation and other operating expenses.  If inflation were to increase over the low levels of recent years, the impact in the short run would be to cause increases in costs, which we would attempt to pass on to our clients, although there is no assurance that we would be able to do so.  Generally, the effects of inflation in recent years have been offset by technological advances, economies of scale and other operational efficiencies.
Our traditional direct marketing operations typically experience their lowest revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year, with higher revenue in the second, third, and fourth quarters.  To minimize the impact of these fluctuations, we continue to seek long-term arrangements with more predictable revenues.
Pricing

Given the diverse nature of the markets and industries in which our clients operate, we deploy a number of pricing techniques designed to yield acceptable margins and returns on invested capital.  In our Marketing Services segment, the majority of revenue is generated from highly customized, outsourced solutions in which prices are dictated by the scope, complexity, nature of assets deployed and service levels required. These solutions are generally provided under long-term contracts and our revenue consists primarily of recurring monthly billings, and to a lesser extent, other volume and variable based billings. In our Audience Solutions segment, revenue is generated from licensing fees, which are typically in the form of recurring monthly billings, as well as transactional revenue based on volume or one-time usage. In addition, Audience Solutions generates digital data revenue from certain publishers and addressable television providers in the form of revenue-sharing agreements. Finally, our Connectivity segment primarily generates revenue from monthly recurring subscription fees sold on an annual basis. To a lesser extent, it also generates revenue from data providers and certain digital publishers in the form of revenue-sharing agreements. Examples of Acxiom pricing techniques are value based recurring revenue models, transactional models, subscription or license models, and professional services models, among others.
Employees

Acxiom employs approximately 3,380 employees (associates) worldwide.  No U.S. associates are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.  To the best of management’s knowledge, approximately 15 associates are elected members of work councils or trade unions representing Acxiom associates in the European Union. Acxiom has never experienced a work stoppage, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
