ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless otherwise noted, references in this Form 10-K to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company,” or “Sezzle” refer to Sezzle Inc.
Our Company 
We are a purpose-driven payments company that is on a mission to financially empower the next generation. Launched in 2017, we have built a digital payments platform that allows merchants to offer their consumers a flexible alternative to traditional credit. As of December 31, 2021, our platform has supported the business growth of over 47 thousand Active Merchants while serving approximately 3.4 million Active Consumers. Through our payments products we aim to enable consumers to take control over their spending, be more responsible, and gain access to financial freedom. Our vision is to create a digital ecosystem benefiting all of our stakeholders - merchant partners, consumers, employees, communities and investors - while continuing to drive ethical growth.
We launched Sezzle amid a backdrop in which digitally-enabled shopping began to claim a larger share of the retail sector and younger generations (i.e., Gen Z and Millennials) started to demonstrate a need for credit. Gen Z and Millennial consumers, which we define as individuals currently between ages 18-25 and 26-44 respectively, use credit cards less frequently relative to other generations and in many cases lack access to traditional credit. These same consumers are tech-savvy, gravitating towards modern, streamlined commerce solutions whether online or in person. We believe that our platform addresses the shortcomings in legacy payment offerings faced by consumers by providing a flexible, secure, omnichannel alternative, with the structural benefit of “creditizing” traditional debit products. The technology solutions we have designed specifically align with our ethos of helping the next generation pave their way forward financially. It is therefore no surprise that, as of December 31, 2021, 80% of our consumer base who have placed an order with us is comprised of Gen Z (18-25) and Millennials (26-44).
The Sezzle Platform connects consumers with merchants via our core proprietary, digital payments platform that instantly extends credit at the point-of-sale. Our core product is differentiated from traditional lenders through our credit-and-capital-light approach, and we believe that it is mutually beneficial for our merchants and consumers given the network effects inherent in our platform. We enable consumers to acquire merchandise upfront and spread payments over four equal, interest-free installments over six weeks. We realize high repeat usage rates by many of our consumers, with the top 10% of our consumers measured by UMS transacting an average of 49 times per year based on the transaction activity during the year ended December 31, 2021, although historical transaction activity is not an indication of future results.
Our core product offering is completely free for consumers who pay on time; instead, we generate a substantial majority of our revenues by charging our merchants fees in the form of a Merchant Discount Rate. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the fees generated through the Merchant Discount Rate comprised 96.1% of our “Sezzle Income”, which is the sum of total merchant fees and rescheduled payment fees, less note origination costs. Sezzle Income represented 85.5% of “Total Income,” which is the sum of Sezzle Income and account reactivation fees for the year ended December 31, 2021.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we launched Sezzle Up, an upgraded version of the core Sezzle experience which provides a credit-building solution for new-to-credit consumers, helping consumers adopt credit responsibly and build their credit history. In the second quarter of 2021, we expanded our product suite to provide consumers of participating merchants with access to a long-term installment lending option pursuant to a partnerships with third-party financial institutions. Through these partnerships, we offer consumers at participating merchants access to an interest-bearing, monthly fixed-rate installment loan product to finance larger-ticket items, generally for up to 60 months, with our lending partners providing the capital and assuming the credit risk to support the product. We receive a fee from our lending partners on a monthly basis based on the total originated loan volume for that month. We believe Sezzle Up and our long-term financing option are among a number of recent initiatives that set us apart from our competitors. 
Further, we believe our multi-stakeholder approach gives us a competitive advantage and positions our company for success because our consumers and merchant partners want to be affiliated with a purpose-driven partner. We reclassified as a public benefit corporation in June 2020, and in March 2021, we also became certified as a B Corporation. Our status as a B Corporation aligns with our mission to achieve growth, profitability, and returns for our investors while continuing to do right by our surrounding communities and our full set of stakeholders. See “Biennial Public Benefit Corporation Statement” below.
We offer a unique and user-friendly platform to our merchants. Our easy integration and seamless onboarding capabilities allow most merchants to go live on our platform within 24 hours of activation so they quickly realize the benefits of partnering with Sezzle. Our merchant categories include small-to-medium sized businesses (“SMBs”), medium-sized brands and large retailers, many of which recognize the benefits of the Sezzle Platform, including an average increase in average order value (“AOV”) of approximately 22% during 2021 based on a review of merchants with a minimum of $80,000 UMS, and an average reduction of approximately 38% in full return orders compared to pre-installation during 2021 based on the review of over 7,500 merchants on the Shopify platform with a minimum of $1,000 in UMS. This all occurs without any credit risk being transferred to the merchant.
The continued expansion of our platform should continue to enhance the benefits for our merchants. Our integration into scaled e-commerce platforms, such as Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce and Wix.com, is expected to give more merchants the opportunity to seamlessly offer Sezzle as a payment option at checkout. We expect our long-term installment loan product will facilitate a broader range of purchases, including larger ticket items by our consumers at participating merchants.
A critical component of our business model is the ability to effectively manage the repayment risk inherent in allowing consumers to pay over time. To that end, a team of Sezzle engineers and risk specialists oversee our proprietary systems, identify transactions with elevated risk of fraud, assess the credit risk of the consumer and assign spending limits, and manage the ultimate receipt of funds. We believe these systems have allowed us to maintain an approximately 81% order approval rate in our core product as of December 2021. Further, we believe repayment risk is more limited relative to other traditional forms of unsecured consumer credit because consumers primarily settle 25% of the purchase value upfront. Additionally, ongoing user interactions allow us to continuously refine and enhance the effectiveness of these platform tools through machine learning.
Our success would not be possible without our dedicated people, who are our company’s greatest asset. Bringing together a team of highly-skilled and innovative engineering, product, marketing and business development professionals and creating an inclusive, team-centric culture in which doing the right thing is celebrated are imperative to execute our strategy.
We have ambitious plans to continue to grow both our consumer base and our merchant partner base, as well as to deepen our level of penetration within each group. We are expanding into new merchant categories to best capture the latest spending trends. In parallel, we are increasing Sezzle’s consumer brand awareness to reach new consumer audiences, while driving higher repeat usage levels by Active Consumers and continuing to develop new ways for these consumers to leverage the Sezzle Platform, including in-store through the Sezzle Virtual Card. We plan to continue partnering with larger merchants through incentive-based arrangements.
We primarily operate in the United States and have operations in Canada, India, Brazil and certain countries in Europe. We are currently evaluating our business opportunities in international markets and may determine to exit markets outside of North America.
Our growth has continued to accelerate during the year. Sezzle Income, the total of merchant fees and rescheduled payment fees less note origination costs, increased to $114.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021—an increase of 95% from the prior year period. Additionally, we recorded $1.8 billion of Underlying Merchant Sales (UMS, as defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 111% from the prior year period. As of December 31, 2021, Active Consumer repeat usage increased for the 36th month in a row, reaching 92.8%. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Key Operating Metrics.”
Technology Solutions
Sezzle Platform
At its core, the Sezzle Platform is a payments solution that instantly extends credit at point-of-sale, allowing consumers to purchase and receive the ordered merchandise at the time of sale and effectively split the payment for the purchase over four equal, interest-free payments over six weeks.
Merchants and consumers have indicated that the Sezzle Platform is easy to use. Our platform is integrated into merchants’ websites via our direct Application Programming Interface and we provide technical support and onboarding services as part of the integration process. We are able to rapidly onboard merchants through an increasingly automated “merchant underwriting process”, and once integrated, merchants can immediately promote Sezzle to their shoppers on product and cart pages to start improving sales conversion. The Sezzle Platform is presented alongside other payment options on the merchant’s “Checkout” page. Consumers then select Sezzle as their payment option and create an account if they are a first-time user with Sezzle in a streamlined process that keeps consumers engaged throughout checkout.
The Sezzle Platform reviews the transaction and consumer profile in real-time and, if approved, quickly confirms the transaction for the merchant and consumer. Once approved, consumers are granted an initial spending limit. Further, our approval engine has a “counteroffer” function, which analyzes above-limit purchase attempts and provides alternative terms so that the consumer is not denied outright. Upon approval, the merchant ships the item(s) and receives payment, just as if the consumer had paid in cash or used a traditional credit or debit card, and the merchant pays us in the form of a Merchant Discount Rate, which is subtracted from the sales price when we pay the merchant.
The Sezzle Platform is completely free to consumers who pay on time. In order to complete their installment payments, consumers will receive a notification via email, SMS, or the Sezzle iOS or Android app two days prior to the date the installment payment is automatically debited by the Sezzle Platform. The consumer is also able to review and manage their Sezzle account via the Sezzle Platform’s online dashboard. From the dashboard, consumers are able to reschedule a payment without charge the first time, and can subsequently reschedule a payment up to three times for a small fee. Consumers who fail to pay for their purchases on time may incur an account reactivation fee, which requires the settlement of an outstanding balance (including the reactivation fee) before they may use our platform again in the future. We typically do not report delinquent core Sezzle accounts to any credit bureaus or collection agencies, unless the consumer has elected to participate in Sezzle Up (as further discussed below). As a result, consumer behavior on the core Sezzle Platform has no impact to a consumer’s credit score.
Our consumer-centric model has enabled us to consistently add Active Consumers each quarter. We added 1.2 million Active Consumers during the year ended December 31, 2021, reaching a total of 3.4 million Active Consumers on the platform at the end of 2021. 
Sezzle Up
In partnership with TransUnion, we engineered Sezzle Up, an upgraded version of the core Sezzle experience that supports consumers in building their credit scores by permitting us to report their payment histories to credit bureaus. As these consumers pay on time, their credit scores and spending limits on the Sezzle Platform can increase. Qualifying for Sezzle Up is simple: existing Sezzle users who elect to participate just need to connect a bank account and pay off one order on time. As a condition to joining Sezzle Up, users commit to complete installment payments over the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) network instead of over a card network. Users’ initial down payment is still completed over a card network. Using the ACH network benefits us by typically reducing processing fees and, in turn, lowering our transaction costs.
We were an early if not the first mover among digital payments platforms that offer a credit-building solution to consumers, and we supplement Sezzle Up’s credit development capabilities with Sezzle U, a free curated series of lessons on personal finance to further help our consumers develop their financial literacy.
Sezzle Virtual Card
Other parts of our product suite and proprietary merchant interface are specifically designed to streamline the merchant experience. Our Sezzle Virtual Card bolsters our omnichannel offering and provides a rapid-installation, point-of-sale option for brick-and-mortar retailers through its compatibility with Apple Pay and Google Pay. With the Sezzle Virtual Card, consumers can enjoy in-store shopping with the convenience of immediately tapping into the Sezzle Platform with the “swipe” of their virtual card at the point-of-sale.
Long-Term Installments 
We look to provide access to a long-term installment financing option to our merchants and consumers while limiting our own capital needs and credit risk. To provide this option to our merchants and consumers, in 2021 we began engaging third-party financial institutions. Through these partnerships, we offer our consumers at participating merchants access to interest-bearing monthly fixed-rate installment-loan products for larger-ticket items, which extend up to 60 months while we earn a fee from our lending partners. We believe providing consumers access to long-term options has the potential to enhance our relationship with both merchants and consumers while generating an attractive fee stream with no capital requirements or credit risk for us and complementing our existing short-term, interest-free offering.
Our Merchants
We believe our merchant partners benefit from our platform’s network effects. By equipping our consumers with a flexible payment product, we help our merchants expand their reach and access a deep and growing pool of consumers who would not otherwise be able to finance a transaction with our merchants. Additionally, we believe that merchants benefit from associating with an innovative payments company with B Corporation status which shares their consumers’ values across environmental, social, and economic causes. Our merchant partnerships span numerous merchant categories, with apparel and accessories; outdoors, sporting goods, and activities; and beauty and cosmetics representing the top three categories by UMS as of December 31, 2021.
We also provide our merchants with a toolkit to grow their businesses that we believe is unmatched among digital payments platforms. Our merchants gain access to our marketing efforts that begin with a launch campaign to introduce new brands to Sezzle consumers, and then follow these efforts with bi-weekly promotional support, quarterly “mega campaigns” that promote participating merchants with added incentives, and initiatives that enable consumers to “shop their values”. In addition, we provide select merchants with incentives to grow their sales and introduce Sezzle into new merchant categories, as well as guaranteed incentives, in order to aid them in recognizing the value proposition. We plan to enter into additional incentive-based arrangements with our larger merchant partners in the near-term and beyond.
We offer a powerful value proposition to our merchant partners, and over 90% of our merchant additions are derived from inbound inquiries. Our platform developed by serving merchants in the SMB category, has continued with our mid-size direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) retailers, and now has accelerated through the establishment of an increasing number of partnerships with large retailers.
SMBs
SMBs, which we define as merchants with UMS of less than $10 million per year, have historically comprised the largest segment of our merchant base. Our fast, easy application process makes onboarding simple, and our user-friendly merchant interface streamlines the integration process. Through Sezzle, these merchants are able to offer their consumers an optimized, effortless checkout process that enables them to complete sales.
Mid-Size Retailers
We are increasing our focus on “mid-size” retailers which tend to be DTC brands, which we define as merchants with UMS of between $10 million and $50 million per year. A diverse array of growing DTC brands that are online-first and seek to connect with consumers without the use of secondary retailers naturally fit within our core offering. As we build out a larger consumer base, we believe we also enhance our value proposition to these brands by driving increased visits to their sites. For example, we drive traffic toward DTC brands that may not otherwise gain exposure through traditional retail channels by creating marketing campaigns designed to increase consumer exposure to their brands.
Large Retailers
An ongoing major initiative is greater engagement with large retailers, which we define as merchants with over $50 million in UMS per year. The core Sezzle product helps these merchants to facilitate a sale by providing access to credit for a consumer who has limited-to-no credit history. Without our payments platform, the consumer that lacks credit history may be rejected after applying for the store’s private label or co-brand credit card, which could tarnish the consumer’s view of that retailer’s brand. Importantly, we are not competing with a large retailer’s card offering. Instead, we work collaboratively with these retailers to drive sales, and over time, serve as a lead generator to consumers who are ready to graduate to the retailer’s card program. Our value proposition and engagement strategy have resonated with large retailers, including Target, Sportsman’s Guide, Lamps Plus, Bass Pro Shops, Barstool Sports, and Market America.
Our Consumers
Sezzle focuses on a young consumer base that is tech-savvy and socially-minded and that expects brands to possess ethical and social principles. As of December 31, 2021, 80% of Sezzle’s consumer base is comprised of members of the Gen Z (18-25) and Millennial (26-44) generations which are generally early in their credit journey. For many of these consumers, we believe Sezzle has provided a way to improve financial responsibility, not only through enhanced budgeting and payments capabilities, but also through an opportunity to build credit history and develop a sense of financial empowerment with the Sezzle Up platform.
Source: Internal data as of December 31, 2021 (Gen Z (18-25), Millennials (26-44), Gen X (45-56), Baby Boomers (57-75), and Silent (76 and greater)).
Gen Z and Millennial consumers use credit cards less frequently relative to other generations and in many cases lack access to traditional credit. As a result, they tend to have fewer viable options for budgeting, achieving financial flexibility, and building credit history. Consumers in these generations also tend to transact frequently across e-commerce and brick-and-mortar retail, but spend less on average per transaction than older generations. In doing so, these consumers prefer to avoid loans that are not transparent or require payments that are not affordable. Sezzle’s core product provides these younger generations, who are newer to credit and are likely to move up the FICO score spectrum as they grow older and transact more often, with a unique solution to these payment challenges.
In addition, consumers benefit from our platform’s network effects. As our platform grows and we establish more merchant partnerships, our consumers enjoy a wider variety of shopping options.
Our Business Model
We believe that we have built a sustainable, transparent business model in which our success is aligned with the financial success of our merchants and consumers.
Core product revenue 
We earn fees from our merchants predominately based on a percentage of UMS plus a fixed fee per transaction, collectively referred to as merchant fees. We pay our merchants for the transaction value upfront net of the merchant fees owed to Sezzle and assume all costs associated with the consumer payment processing, fraud and payment default. Merchant-related fees comprised approximately 82% of our Total Income for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Long-term product revenue 
For our long-term financing product where we take no balance sheet or credit risk, we charge a platform fee to our financial partners, which is a fixed percentage of UMS on a monthly basis. We also share a negotiated percentage of the merchant discount revenue with our financial partners. This amount may vary based on our partner and the volume of UMS. Our financial partners earns interest from consumers through this product, but we do not earn any interest or take any credit risk.
Consumer-based revenue 
We do not charge our consumers any interest, finance charges or initiation fees and are not incentivized to profit from our consumers’ errors or financial adversity. Any consumer-based revenue that we earn is derived from fees that we charge to reactivate an account following a failed payment and when consumers elect to reschedule a payment. We permit consumers to reschedule a payment without charging a fee once per order, and reactivation fees are waived if the consumer corrects a failed payment within 48 hours. Additionally, we have a hardship and fee forgiveness program which allows consumers to have fees waived. Consumer-related revenue comprised approximately 19% of our Total Income for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Capital-light strategy
We have created an efficient funding strategy which has allowed us to scale our business and drive rapid growth. We have existing access to revolving credit facilities. Additionally, we also pay merchants a low interest rate if they elect not to receive transaction proceeds upfront and instead leave cash with us.
Our products are entirely funded through our $250 million warehouse facility and merchant account payables. The high-velocity with which we are able to recycle capital due to the short-term nature of our products has a multiplier effect on our committed capital. We do not require equity to directly fund product growth.
History and Public Benefit Corporation Structure
Our founders created the Sezzle Platform in 2016 after observing an increasing trend in the United States of a lack of availability of credit for consumers (particularly younger consumers). Since we launched the Sezzle Platform in August 2017, our activities have principally involved raising money to develop our software, products and services (including the Sezzle Platform), as well as signing merchants to the Sezzle Platform and expanding our service offerings to an increasing base of consumers.
Sezzle is incorporated in Delaware as a public benefit corporation. Public benefit corporations are for-profit corporations intended to produce a public benefit and operate in a responsible and sustainable manner. Under Delaware law, public benefit corporations must identify in their certificate of incorporation the public benefit or benefits they will promote, and their directors have a duty to manage the affairs of the corporation in a manner that balances the pecuniary interests of the stockholders, the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation’s conduct and the specific public benefit or public benefits identified in the public benefit corporation’s certificate of incorporation. Our statement of the public benefits we will promote is included under “Biennial Public Benefit Corporation Statement” below.
Being a public benefit corporation offers advantages, including:
•public benefit corporation status is a clear differentiator in an increasingly growing, and sometimes crowded, industry;
•we are more likely to become an employer of choice as the younger workforce increasingly seek employment from companies which align with their ethical values;
•further opportunities to conduct business with brands that also care about sustainability;
•the potential to expand our consumer base due to conscious consumers;
•added credibility to our mission statement and potential to grow capital through impact investing; and
•further opportunities for positive public relations and marketing.
On March 22, 2021, Sezzle became certified as a B Corporation by B Lab, an independent non-profit organization, and thereby joined a movement of innovative socially-conscious brands. In order to be designated as a Certified B Corporation, we were required to undertake a comprehensive and objective assessment of our environmental and social standards for transparency, accountability and commitment to improved performance. Our actions are part of a movement of innovative brands around the world intent on advancing environmental, social, and economic causes. To maintain our status as a certified B Corporation, we must satisfy re-certification requirements every three years.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive and dynamic industry. Our product offerings face competition from a variety of players, including those who enable transactions and commerce via digital payments. The point-of-sale financing market in which we operate includes several types of products. For example, consumers may make purchases with credit cards that have revolving balances and some of these products offer promotional terms, such as an introductory rate or deferred interest. In addition to traditional credit card products, some revolving balance products do not issue plastic credit cards to consumers (e.g., PayPal Credit). BNPL products, such as the Sezzle Platform, facilitate consumer purchases from retail merchants on installment plans. Credit card providers also offer products that allow consumers to pay for purchases made with their credit cards in installments rather than as a revolving balance (e.g., American Express and J.P. Morgan Chase). Visa and Mastercard, the major payments networks, have also introduced technology that facilitate this functionality. 
We consider our main competitors to be other BNPL service providers. In the U.S. market, this includes Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, PayPal’s Pay in 4, and Zip (formerly QuadPay). In addition, PayBright by Affirm and Afterpay operate in the Canadian market. In July 2021, Apple announced its intention to provide a BNPL platform to its consumers called “Apple Pay Later.” We aim to differentiate our business to consumers by providing a product that is more simple to understand and consumer friendly than our competitors. This includes allowing the consumer to shift their repayment schedule once per order for free, and waiving Account Reactivation Fees where the consumer corrects a failed payment within 48 hours. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Industry - We operate in a highly competitive industry, and our inability to compete successfully would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.”
We face intense competitive pressure on the fees we charge our merchants, particularly our larger merchants. To stay competitive, we may need to adjust our pricing or offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume, enter new market segments, adapt to regulatory changes, and expand their use and acceptance of the Sezzle Platform. These include up-front cash payments, fee discounts, rebates, credits, performance-based incentives, marketing, and other support payments that impact our revenues and profitability. Market pressures on pricing, incentives, fee discounts, and rebates could moderate our growth. We have entered into merchant agreements that require us to make marketing, incentive or other payments to the merchant over the term of the agreement. In addition, if we are unable to fulfill our obligations under these merchant agreements, including any payments we have agreed to make with merchants, the merchant may terminate such agreement or determine not to renew and remain on our platform.
Intellectual Property
Our business depends on our ability to commercially exploit our technology and intellectual property rights, including our technological systems and data processing algorithms. We rely on laws in the United States, Canada and other countries relating to trade secrets, copyright, and trademarks to assist in protecting our proprietary rights. Our core intellectual property asset is the Sezzle Platform and the accumulation of transaction data, rules and consumer insights generated from consumers using the Sezzle Platform, including the proprietary fraud and risk detection systems.
We developed our proprietary fraud and risk detection systems by creating valuable intellectual property that enables us to improve our products. The Sezzle Fraud Detection System was developed by the Company’s data sciences team, which utilizes numerous data points from a transaction to identify the likelihood of a fraudulent attempt. Consumer interactions with the Sezzle Platform are recorded and analyzed along with data points on the consumer and order itself. This data passes through the Sezzle Fraud Detection System, which scores the likelihood of the transaction being fraudulent. The Sezzle Underwriting Engine then assigns a score to each new consumer that passes through the Sezzle Fraud Detection System. Based on data obtained from traditional and non-traditional sources, along with the order data and retailer data, we give some shoppers a higher initial limit than others. As consumers use the Sezzle Platform, Sezzle’s system learns from the behavior of the individual consumers and adapts the consumer’s limit to the appropriate level based on the consumer’s success level within the Sezzle Platform.
We do not currently have any issued patents, but continue to consider the most effective methods of protecting our intellectual property. We currently hold registered trademarks in the United States, the UK, the European Union, and India, and we have pending trademark applications in Canada and Brazil. However, continued operations within our existing markets and expansion into new markets risks conflicts with unrelated companies who may own registered trademarks for and/or otherwise use a similar name. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Other Risks Related to Our Business – Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient.”
Government Regulation
Overview
Various aspects of our business and services are subject to U.S. federal, state, and local regulation, as well as regulation outside the United States including Canada. Certain of our services also are subject to rules promulgated by various card networks and other authorities, as more fully described below. These descriptions are not exhaustive, and these laws, regulations and rules frequently change and are increasing in number.
BNPL and Consumer Protection Regulation
The BNPL segment of the point-of-sale financing market in which we operate is a developing field. There has recently been an increased focus and scrutiny by regulators in various jurisdictions, including the United States and Canada, with respect to BNPL arrangements. We may become subject to additional legal or regulatory requirements if laws or regulations or the interpretation of such laws and regulations change in the future or industry standards for BNPL arrangements change in the future.
United States 
In the United States, we are required to comply with the applicable provisions of the Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder, which require certain disclosures to consumers regarding the terms and conditions of their loans and credit transactions and impose requirements on credit accessed through credit cards, Section 5 of the FTCA, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts or practices (“UDAP”) in or affecting commerce and analogous provisions in each state; the Consumer Financial Protections Act, which prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAP”) in connection with consumer financial products and services; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B promulgated thereunder, which prohibit creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, marital status, the fact that all or part of the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance program, or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act or applicable state law; the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), which promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies; the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the “FDCPA”), which provides guidelines and limitations concerning the conduct of third-party debt collectors in connection with the collection of consumer debts; and the and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the “TCPA”), which regulates the use of telephone and texting technology to contact customers.
We are also subject to the Holder in Due Course Rule of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and equivalent state laws, which requires any holder of a consumer credit contract to include a required notice and become subject to all claims and defenses that a borrower could assert against the seller of goods or services; the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which provides disclosure requirements, guidelines, and restrictions on the electronic transfer of funds from consumers’ bank accounts; the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act and similar state laws, which authorize the creation of legally binding and enforceable agreements utilizing electronic records and signatures; the Military Lending Act and similar state laws, which provide obligations and prohibitions relating to loans made to servicemembers and their dependents; and the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which allows active duty military members to suspend or postpone certain civil obligations. In addition, we are subject to the requirements under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act relating to collection and credit reporting, though many of the implementing regulations under the CARES Act have not yet been issued.
We possess certain state lending licenses and we are currently in the process of applying for others, which subject us to supervisory oversight from these state license authorities and periodic examinations. We currently hold licenses in six U.S. states (California, North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, Montana and Missouri) to operate our business in those states, in particular to originate loans to consumers residing in those jurisdictions. The loans we may originate on our platform pursuant to these state licenses are subject to state licensing and interest rate fee restrictions, as well as numerous state requirements regarding consumer protection, interest rate, disclosure, prohibitions on certain activities, and loan term lengths. Our business may become subject to licensing requirements in states in which we currently do not hold licenses. For instance, in certain states we are currently not required to obtain a lending license because our extension of credit in those states is structured as retail installment transactions. We continue to monitor state licensing regulations and how they may apply to our business, and may be required in the future to apply for additional state licenses, including states in which our loans are structured as retail installment transactions.
Canada
In Canada, we are required to comply with the Canada Anti-Spam Law, which regulates the transmittal of commercial email messages, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and equivalent provincial privacy laws in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec, each of which includes requirements surrounding the use, disclosure, and other processing of certain personal information about Canadian residents. In addition, we are required to comply with the Canada federal and provincial human rights legislation which prohibits discriminatory practices to deny, deny access to, or to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual in respect of the provision of services customarily available to the general public on the basis of a certain prohibited grounds of discrimination. The Canadian provincial consumer protection and cost of credit disclosure laws prohibit late fees, impose limits on default charges, prohibit unfair practices, and include consumer contract disclosure and related process requirements, among other compliance requirements. We are also subject to Canadian provincial and territorial e-commerce laws.
We believe that we are appropriately licensed as a lender and/or have structured our business activities to avoid a licensing requirement in each of the Canadian provinces that require such licenses. In connection with our business activities, we are also generally subject to consumer protection legislation and other laws and, on that basis, our business is also generally subject to regulatory oversight and supervision from federal and/or provincial regulators in respect of those activities, regardless of whether we have a license. These regulators and enforcement agencies generally act on a complaints-basis and may receive consumer complaints about us. Investigations or enforcement actions may be costly and time consuming. Enforcement actions by such regulators and enforcement agencies could lead to fines, penalties, consumer restitution, the cessation of our business activities in whole or in part, or the assertion of private claims and lawsuits against us.
Payment Regulations
We are subject to the rules, codes of conduct and standards of Visa, Mastercard and other payment networks and their participants. In order to provide our payment processing services, we must be registered either indirectly or directly as service providers with the payment networks that we use. As such, we are subject to applicable card association and payment network rules, standards and regulations, which impose various requirements and could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by such associations or networks for certain acts or omissions. Card associations and payment networks and their member financial institutions regularly update and generally expand security expectations and requirements related to the security of consumer data and environments. Failure to comply with the networks’ requirements, or to pay the fees or fines they may impose, could result in the suspension or termination of our registration with the relevant payment networks and therefore require us to limit, suspend or cease providing the relevant payment processing services. We are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”) with respect to the acceptance of payment cards, which provides for security standards relating to the processing of cardholder data and the systems that process such data. The failure of our products to comply with PCI DSS requirements may result in the loss of our status as a PCI DSS certified Service Provider and thereby impact our relationship with our merchant partners and their own ability to comply with PCI DSS. 
In Canada, we are required to comply with the Payments Canada Rule H1- Pre-Authorized Debit Rules in respect of the acceptance of payments from Canadian bank accounts and the Quebec Charter of French Language laws which regulates the language of communication in commerce and business and applies to entities carrying on business in Quebec.
Data Privacy and Data Security Laws 
We are subject to a variety of laws, rules, directives, and regulations, as well as contractual obligations, relating to the processing of personal information, including personally identifiable information. The regulatory framework for privacy and data protection worldwide is rapidly evolving and, as a result, implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to continue to evolve for the foreseeable future. We publicly post policies and documentation regarding our practices concerning the processing of personal information. This publication of our privacy policy and other documentation that provide information about our privacy and security practices is required by applicable law and can subject us to proceedings and actions brought by data protection authorities, government entities, consumers (either individually or in a class action), or others if our policies are alleged to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices.
We are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the “GLBA”) and implementing regulations and guidance thereunder, in addition to applicable privacy and data protection laws in the other jurisdictions in which we carry on business activities or process personal information. Among other requirements, the GLBA imposes certain limitations on the ability to share consumers’ nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties and requires certain disclosures to consumers about information collection, sharing, and security practices and their right to “opt out” of the institution’s disclosure of their nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. Privacy requirements, including notice and opt out requirements, under the GLBA and the FCRA are enforced by the FTC and by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) through UDAAP claims, and are a standard component of CFPB examinations. State entities also may initiate actions for alleged violations of privacy or security compliance under state UDAAP claims, financial privacy, security and other laws.
Furthermore, an increasing number of state, federal, and international jurisdictions have enacted, or are considering enacting, privacy and data security laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) which was based on the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which regulates the collection, processing and use of personal information of data subjects in the European Union and the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronics Document Act. The CCPA gives residents of California expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used, and also provides for civil penalties for violations and private rights of action for data breaches. Meanwhile, the GDPR provides data subjects with greater control over the processing of their personal information (such as the “right to be forgotten”) and has specific requirements relating to cross-border transfers of personal information to certain jurisdictions outside the EEA, including to the United States, with fines for noncompliance of up to the greater of 20 million euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company. From January 1, 2021, we may also have to comply in respect of certain of our activities with the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. In addition, on November 3, 2020, California voters approved a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which significantly modifies the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain personal information and creating a new state agency to oversee implementation and enforcement efforts. Many of the CPRA’s provisions will become effective on January 1, 2023. Additionally, on March 2, 2021, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“CDPA”) was signed into law and multiple other states are considering enacting similar legislation. The Virginia CDPA becomes effective beginning January 1, 2023, and contains similar provisions to the CCPA and CPRA. Other states have recently or may soon pass similar laws and promulgate related regulations, including the Colorado Privacy Act (CoPA) (signed into law in July 2021 with rulemaking currently in progress) and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA) (signed into law March 24, 2022). Most states also have in place data security laws requiring companies to maintain certain safeguards with respect to the processing of personal information, and all states require companies to notify individuals or government regulators in the event of a data breach impacting such information. In addition, most industrialized countries have or are in the process of adopting similar privacy or data security laws enforced through data protection authorities.
Other Applicable Regulations
We are subject to regulations relating to our corporate conduct and the conduct of our business, including securities laws, trade regulations and anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws and anti-corruption legislation. The United States and certain foreign jurisdictions have taken aggressive stances with respect to such matters and have implemented new initiatives and reforms.
We are required to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Foreign Public Officials Act (Canada), the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, which prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the SEC, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals.
AML laws and related KYC requirements generally require certain companies to conduct necessary due diligence to prevent and protect against money laundering. AML enforcement activity could result in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Regulators and enforcement agencies may receive consumer complaints about us. In the United States, these regulators and agencies include the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), which could subject us to burdensome rules and regulations that could increase costs and use of our resources in order to satisfy our compliance obligations. We are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs including Canadian sanctions laws and the sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries, individuals, and entities.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 540 employees across the operations, sales and marketing, and platform development teams. No employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements at this time. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
Our success to date would not be possible without our dedicated people, who we believe are our greatest asset. Bringing together a team of highly-skilled engineering, product, marketing and business development professionals is imperative to executing on our strategy. We do this by creating an inclusive, team-centric culture in which doing the right thing is celebrated.
In light of our commitment to our employees, we upgraded our Human Resources Information Systems during 2021 to ensure state-of-the-art management, operation and oversight of our workforce. Our goals in this upgrade were to:
•ensure that People Operations is equipped with the tools, training and motivation to operate in the most efficient and effective manner;
•continue to promote and recruit the best-qualified people while embracing the value of diversity in the workplace;
•allow for more accurate measurement and accountability on the diversity front;
•provide a competitive salary and benefits package and develop the full potential of our workforce by providing training and development for career enhancement; and
•secure accurate and timely information relating to employee turnover, mobility, retention and the percentage of positions filled internally.
We also updated our Diversity Policy and Ethics Policy to renew and refine our commitment to derive strength from a diverse workforce. We have an active Diversity, Equity and Inclusion group to further ensure communication throughout the organization on issues impacting minorities. Employees are encouraged to participate in company and community activities to secure an improved quality of life for ourselves, our co-workers and the community.
We embrace change and the opportunity it brings. On March 10, 2022 we announced a workforce reduction aimed at positioning the business for long-term growth while establishing a path toward profitability and free cash flow. Combined with normal attrition since the beginning of 2022, the reduction impacts approximately 20% of our North American workforce. We continue to be focused on acting openly, equitably and consistently in our pursuit of uncompromising quality. To meet this goal, we remain committed to recruiting, developing, rewarding and retaining our global workforce.
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)
We are focused on the environmental, social and governance concerns that are important to our consumers, merchant partners, employees and other stakeholders. We are committed to integrating consideration of these concerns into the decisions made across our business with a view to enhancing sustainability, promoting employee equity and wellness, and supporting the communities in which we operate.
Carbon Footprint and Land Regeneration
On July 15, 2021, through a combination of reduction efforts and carbon offsets, we officially became 100% carbon neutral. As a Climate Neutral Certified company, we reduce our carbon emissions by choosing to do business in a way that aids environmental conservation. By taking responsibility for decreasing climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions, we are taking action to affect climate change. During 2020, we also partnered with Trees for the Future, helping the organization by planting one tree per new Sezzle user, contributing to their mission to end hunger and poverty by training farmers to regenerate their land.
Community Engagement 
Sezzle Inc. is proud to make a positive difference in the communities that it serves.
In 2020, we launched Sezzle Up, an upgraded version of the core Sezzle experience which provides a credit-building solution for new-to-credit consumers, helping consumers adopt credit responsibly and build their credit history. We have also collaborated with the University of Minnesota to provide “full-ride” scholarships to underrepresented students pursuing degrees in technology. We also partner with nonprofits on initiatives such as Blacks in Technology, a global platform establishing standards for technical excellence and serving members through community, media and mentorship, to provide financial support, mentoring and free legal advice to their entrepreneurs.
Biennial Public Benefit Corporation Statement
Under Delaware law, a public benefit corporation is required to no less than biennially provide its stockholders with a statement as to the corporation’s promotion of the public benefit or public benefits identified in the certificate of incorporation and of the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation’s conduct. The following is intended to serve as the required statement to stockholders.
As a Delaware public benefit corporation, we have committed to pursuing opportunities for positive change in the community and the planet. Our management team and board of directors strongly believe that our long-standing commitment to financial education and helping young adults with their approach to personal finances, as well as creating alternative means for consumers to purchase items they need without incurring high-interest finance charges, benefit the community and serve as a public good.
When considering Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Sezzle focuses on five primary areas: governance, impact on workers (human capital), environment, customers and the community (“Factors”). These Factors align with the targeted focus of the B Lab, BCorp Impact Assessment.
Each section focuses on a different area and opportunity to maximize value for ESG and CSR initiatives. The governance portion gauges the overall mission, ethics/transparency, and social/environmental impact; including Sezzle’s ability to protect the mission and stakeholder considerations through corporate structure and/or governing documents.
The workers/human capital portion assesses Sezzle’s contributions to its employees through various areas including financial security, health, safety, wellness, career development, engagement and satisfaction. 
The community portion analyzes Sezzle’s relationship with and impact on the community. Focus here includes diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), impact on the economy, community engagement, charity, and supply chain management. 
The environment portion evaluates Sezzle’s management practices as they relate to air, climate, water, land, and biodiversity. This evaluation includes the direct impact of a company’s operations and, when applicable, its supply chain channels. 
The customer portion evaluates Sezzle’s commitment to its customers through the quality of its services, ethical marketing, data privacy/security, and other customer/consumer factors. This initiative recognizes services that improve the social impact of the community.
Sezzle maintains annual Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure its successful progress in achieving and promoting sustainable and meaningful commitment to ESG/CSR. The annual reporting occurs in June of each year. The KPIs are based on the identified Factors derived from the B Lab Impact Assessment which offer the largest opportunity of improvement for Sezzle. The Board of Directors receives annual updates on progress made against such KPIs. Additionally, the Board ensures that social responsibility remains a factor in its decision making process.
Upon initial certification, Sezzle had a B Lab rating of 80.7. To date, Sezzle’s metrics indicate an improvement of at least 8%. While figures may change over time due to new strategic initiatives, changes in operations and external factors, current metrics show a consistent improvement in Sezzle’s commitment to ESG/CSR. We believe that the improvements in our B Lab rating during 2021, in conjunction with the activities described above under “Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)”, support the conclusion that the Company has been successful in promoting our stated public benefits.
