 Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on leveraging our proprietary ImmunoTAC technology platform to develop systemically delivered, tissue targeted therapeutics for the treatment of chronic viral infections, cancer, and other serious diseases. Our ImmunoTAC platform is the result of a focused effort to discover ways to systemically deliver disease-modifying small molecules in a directed fashion to sites of disease. Our platform enables us to strategically pair proprietary linker-payloads that modulate key disease-modifying pathways with monoclonal antibodies directed to specific disease sites. Many potentially promising systemic therapies fail to maximize their therapeutic potential due to toxicities in healthy tissues. Our approach is designed to expand the therapeutic window and avert unacceptable toxicities by directly targeting specific disease sites where our therapeutics are locally active.
In July of 2020, we initiated clinical development of our first ImmunoTAC product candidate, a TLR8 agonist conjugated to a HER2 antibody, SBT6050. Preclinical data suggested that we would be able to demonstrate a therapeutic window and advance SBT6050 through clinical development as a monotherapy and in combination with standard-of-care agents that had a complementary mechanism-of-action. Our Phase 1/1b program was designed to measure safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. On March 28, 2022, we made the decision to discontinue our clinical development program for SBT6050 due to limited monotherapy activity and dose-limiting adverse events when used in combination with pembrolizumab. SBT6290, comprised of the same linker payload conjugated to a Nectin4 antibody, was expected to show a similar clinical profile and, therefore, we also terminated this program prior to dosing patients. We have prioritized our resources to focus on the development of SBT8230 and early-stage discovery programs.
Our understanding of TLR8 conjugates in preclinical species and in the clinic guides our interpretation of the preclinical characteristics of SBT8230, an ASGR1 antibody conjugated to a TLR8 agonist linker payload for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (cHBV), which is currently in preclinical development. ASGR1 is highly expressed in liver and is restricted in its expression to this organ. Other ASGR1-directed agents, such as those used in RNAi therapies, have shown robust liver localization. SBT8230 shows biodistribution profiles in non-human primates (NHP) consistent with these agents, which is distinct from SBT6050 and SBT6290. We believe that efficient liver targeting of SBT8230 via ASGR1 binding has the potential to lead to markedly lower serum exposures of SBT8230 in patients compared to those observed with SBT6050 in the clinic at any dose evaluated. We believe the preclinical to clinical experience for SBT6050, coupled with the NHP PK, PD, and tolerability data for SBT8230, suggest that the clinical safety, PK and PD profiles for SBT8230 has the potential to be notably different than those for SBT6050, given the large differences in serum exposures and overall conjugate disposition for SBT8230 that are expected in patients due to its efficient liver targeting. SBT8230 is designed to elicit an anti-viral immune response by targeting TLR8 activation to the liver. The anti-viral immune response is achieved through activation of myeloid cells and subsequent activation of immune cells that drive an IFNγ signal, which has been observed in the clinic with SBT6050. This has been shown by others to drive seroconversion, an important determinant of a functional cure. We see a significant opportunity in liver-localized immunotherapies as a potential way of achieving durable responses in these patients. We are focused on advancing SBT8230, our liver-targeted conjugate designed to potently activate human myeloid cells in the liver for the treatment of cHBV.

Further support for investigating TLR8 agonism for the treatment of cHBV comes from selgantolimod (GS-9688), an existing untargeted, orally administered TLR8 agonist being developed by Gilead Sciences. Selgantolimod has generated anti-viral immune responses in a cHBV animal model. The clinical development of this untargeted TLR8 agonist has shown promise, but we believe that toxicity prevented the use of a sufficient dose to elicit optimal clinical activity. We believe liver-localized TLR8 agonism could better realize the potential for effective therapy and potentially lead to functional cure, which is defined as sustained loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in the blood, in patients suffering from cHBV. We presented a preclinical update on SBT8230 in the fourth quarter of 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, we began a Phase 1-enabling toxicology study. We plan to complete a Phase 1 regulatory submission in the fourth quarter of 2022 and begin a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) study in healthy volunteers in the first half of 2023. After completing the SAD study, we anticipate initiating a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in patients with chronic HBV, who are virally suppressed on nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) therapy.
 In addition, our internal discovery programs are focused on evaluating and developing new antigen binding domains specific for targets of interest (including antibodies), next-generation linker technologies, and both agonist and antagonist small molecule payloads, that may be combined to create novel tissue-targeted antibody conjugates. The integration of medicinal chemistry, bioconjugation, protein engineering, bioinformatics, pharmacology, and translational medicine expertise focused on developing tissue-targeted therapies allows us to leverage key learnings from our previous clinical program to bring forward the next generation of therapeutics. We anticipate providing an update on our discovery pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2022.
 Our ImmunoTAC Platform 
Our ImmunoTAC platform is the result of a focused effort to systemically deliver disease-modifying small molecules in a directed fashion to sites of disease. Many potentially promising systemic therapies fail to maximize their therapeutic potential due to toxicities in healthy tissues. Our approach is designed to localize disease-modifying payloads to specific sites of disease where our therapeutics are locally active.
   Our Development Pipeline 
Our ImmunoTAC platform drives our development pipeline of tissue targeted therapeutic candidates as summarized in the chart below:


Our Strategy 
Our goal is to transform the treatment of cHBV, cancer and other serious diseases with unmet need using our ImmunoTAC platform to deliver a new class of systemically delivered, tissue-directed, and locally active therapies. The key elements of our business strategy are to:
•Demonstrate anti-viral properties of TLR8 in cHBV. We are applying learnings from our TLR8 agonist oncology programs and clinical experience to maximize the potential of SBT8230. Our understanding of TLR8 conjugates in preclinical species and in the clinic guides our interpretation of the preclinical characteristics of SBT8230, an ASGR1 antibody conjugated to a TLR8 agonist linker payload for the treatment of cHBV that is currently in preclinical development. 
 •Maximize the therapeutic potential of SBT8230. The immune activating mechanism of SBT8230 is complimentary to other treatments for cHBV that interfere with components of the viral life cycle such as nucleoside and nucleotide analogs, capsid inhibitors, and RNAi-based therapies. Furthermore, our ASGR1 antibody does not cross block GalNAc, allowing for combinations with RNAi-based therapies. 


•Leverage our ImmunoTAC platform for promising new antibody-linker-payload combinations. We are strategically pairing our disease-modulating payloads with tissue targeted binding domains to create new therapeutic agents with the goal of providing benefits to patients. We plan to continue to leverage our ImmunoTAC platform, discovery of antigen binding domains (including antibodies), new linker technologies and therapeutic discovery infrastructure to discover and develop novel small molecule therapeutics conjugated to antibodies. 
 •Internally and externally source potentially transformative assets and technologies that align with our mission to develop tissue-targeted therapies. We have extensive expertise in protein engineering, small molecule linker and payload chemistry, and translational medicine that we apply to the discovery and advancement of new tissue-targeted agents to the clinic. Our clinical development team is a seasoned group with experience in developing antibody-drug conjugates and other therapeutics across all phases of development. While we have robust internal discovery capabilities, we also believe that innovative technologies can be acquired through business development activities. We therefore plan to continue to pursue synergistic, in-licensing opportunities to augment our internal discovery efforts. 
 •Evaluate opportunities to accelerate development timelines and/or enhance the commercial potential of our programs in partnership with third parties. We plan to selectively explore potential strategic partnerships on a program-by-program basis with biopharmaceutical partners whose research, development, commercial, and/or geographic capabilities complement our own. We believe strategic partnerships can help mitigate clinical and commercial risk, accelerate timelines, and/or maximize global commercial potential. 
 Our Team
We have an accomplished management team with a proven track record of therapeutic research and development expertise and of generating meaningful stockholder value. The members of our team have deep experience in discovering and developing therapeutics, including acalabrutinib, brentuximab vedotin, entrectinib, etanercept, ibrutinib, lisocabtagene maraleucel, sunitinib, tezepelumab, tucatinib, and venetoclax.
Activating the Myeloid Cell Compartment Through Liver-Targeted TLR8 Agonism 
As shown in the figure below, TLR8 activation of human myeloid cells plays an important role in the anti-viral immune response in cHBV. HBV-infected liver is highly immunosuppressive and the activation of macrophages and other myeloid cells in the liver can serve to overcome this immunosuppression. We believe TLR8 is the optimal target for activating these myeloid cell types due to its restricted expression and function within these cells. TLR8 is also highly expressed in conventional dendritic cells which promote antigen presentation and the production of cytokines important for the generation of T and B cell responses against hepatitis B virus. TLR8 is not expressed in T or B lymphocytes, but TLR8 activation in human myeloid cells secondarily induces IFNγ production by T cells and antibody production by B cells, both shown to be associated with the generation of functional cure in cHBV.

Silverback’s Preclinical and Clinical Development Experience with a HER2-Directed TLR8 Agonist Conjugate, SBT6050
We have gained pre-clinical and clinical experience with TLR8 conjugates through our recently discontinued SBT6050 program. In this program, a HER2-TLR8 agonist conjugate was administered to 58 patients as monotherapy and in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor at dose levels ranging from 0.15 mg/kg through 1.2 mg/kg with the length of patient experience ranging from 2 weeks through 41 weeks. We observed a dose response for adverse events related to immune activation, serum PK, serum pharmacodynamic markers, tumor exposure and intratumoral pharmacodynamic markers inclusive of data that demonstrates activation of immune mechanisms in biopsies collected from patients after treatment. However, antitumor activity was limited in the monotherapy arm, and increased toxicity in combination with checkpoint inhibitors limited dose escalation beyond 0.3 mg/kg. In the 18 patients treated in combination with pembrolizumab, while we observed decreasing volume stable disease in some patients, we did not see responses meeting RECIST criteria. Furthermore, at 0.3 mg/kg in combination with pembrolizumab, although there were no DLTs with additional patients and longer follow-up, it was determined that long-term tolerability was challenging. Several patients experienced grade 3 adverse events in later cycles, including grade 3 hypotension. Finally, PK and PD at 0.3 mg/kg were suboptimal.
 On the other hand, there were important learnings from the SBT6050 clinical program that we are applying to SBT8230. In the SBT6050 clinical trial, exposures increased with dose and the data demonstrated that the conjugate was stable in circulation. Free payload was undetectable in ~98% of blood samples evaluated and in the few samples in which payload was detectable, the levels were at least an order of magnitude below the lowest active concentrations of payload. SBT6050 induced PD activity indicative of myeloid and natural killer (NK) and/or T cell activation at all dose levels, confirming the proposed mechanism of action of TLR8 agonism, and PD activity was maintained with repeat dosing.
Our understanding of TLR8 conjugates in preclinical species and in the clinic guides our interpretation of the preclinical characteristics of SBT8230, an ASGR1 antibody conjugated to a TLR8 agonist linker payload for the treatment of cHBV currently in preclinical development. ASGR1 is highly expressed in liver and is restricted in its expression to this organ. Other ASGR1-directed agents, such as those used by RNAi therapies, have shown robust liver localization. SBT8230 shows biodistribution profiles in NHP consistent with these agents and is distinct from SBT6050 and SBT6290 in this regard.
SBT8230: TLR8 Agonist Conjugated to an ASGR1 Antibody 
We have engineered SBT8230 to treat cHBV by eliciting an anti-viral immune response through targeting TLR8 activation to the liver. SBT8230 is comprised of an ASGR1 monoclonal antibody conjugated to the same TLR8 linker-payload as SBT6050, but with an average drug antibody ratio (DAR) of about 2 as opposed to the average DAR of about 4 used in SBT6050.  
cHBV infection remains a worldwide problem affecting approximately 257 million people and contributing to an estimated 887,000 deaths in 2015. In the United States alone, approximately 860,000 people suffer from cHBV. cHBV is estimated to be the cause of 60-80% of the world’s primary liver cancers. There is a significant unmet need for therapies that can elicit a functional cure for the disease, which is defined as sustained loss of HBsAg in the blood. Many of the approved therapies for cHBV have low functional cure rates or lack durability over time.
Clinical and preclinical evidence by third parties have demonstrated that IFNg-mediated immune responses, including the activation of IFNg+ T cell and IgG B cell anti-viral responses, can lead to a functional cure in cHBV patients and animal models of HBV. In HBV transgenic mice, HBV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells have exhibited the ability to inhibit hepatocellular replication by a noncytopathic process that is mediated primarily by IFNg. In acutely infected chimpanzees, viral replication was almost completely abolished soon after CD3 and IFNg mRNA increased in the liver. Evidence by third parties has demonstrated that HBV-specific IFNg producing CD4 T cells were associated with viral clearance in patients with cHBV infection. Additionally, these studies have demonstrated that TLR8 agonists were particularly effective in activation of myeloid cells and the induction of IFNg. The figure below shows IFNg production after human blood or liver-derived mononuclear cells were stimulated with the indicated TLR agonist. TLR8 was unique in its ability to induce IFNg. 

TLR8 Drove IFNg Production from Liver Mononuclear Cells in Third Party Preclinical Studies 


   In addition, the figures below show concentrations of individual cytokines quantified in the supernatant of purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or isolated mononuclear cells from the liver after stimulation with either a TLR8 or TLR7 agonist. TLR8 agonism, but not TLR7 agonism, induced IFNγ production, along with the production of other cytokines important in the generation of anti-viral immunity such as TNFα, IL-1ß, and IL-6, from both liver and blood immune cells. We believe these data from third parties demonstrate that TLR8 is the agonist of choice for improving the outcome for patients with cHBV. 
TLR8 Agonism Drove Cytokine Production

In a preclinical woodchuck model of cHBV conducted by a third party, oral administration of a TLR8 agonist small molecule, GS-9688 (selgantolimod), was shown to drive seroconversion and reduce woodchuck hepatitis virus S antigen and woodchuck hepatitis B viral levels. Selgantolimod’s effectiveness in cHBV patients has been limited, however. We believe (i) this is due to not achieving necessary exposures because of DLTs associated with activation of myeloid cells outside of the liver and (ii) that systemically delivered but liver localized TLR8 agonism could improve the potential for effective therapy and lead to functional cures in cHBV. 
SBT8230 is a Liver-Localized TLR8 Agonist Designed to Combine with other cHBV Drugs to Achieve Functional Cure in cHBV
As shown in the figure below, we designed SBT8230 to be comprised of an ASGR1 monoclonal antibody conjugated to a TLR8 linker-payload with the goal of activating the myeloid cell compartment in liver tissue only. The conjugate is designed to be internalized in myeloid cells in an FcR-mediated manner when ASGR1 is present on adjacent liver cells. In addition, the ASGR1 mAb of SBT8230 was designed to bind to an epitope distinct from that recognized by GalNAc to allow for combination with GalNAc-based therapies.

Background on ASGR1 
As with all ADC-based therapeutics, an expression profile differential of the target antigen on healthy tissue relative to target tissues is critical. As shown in the figure below, the expression of ASGR1 is a liver-restricted scavenger receptor that is highly restricted to this organ. Furthermore, it is a clinically validated target that has been successfully targeted by GalNAc-based therapeutics.

ASGR1 Expression is Restricted to the Liver


   The antibody backbone of SBT8230 has been designed to possess high affinity and specificity for ASGR1 and is not an efficient binder to ASGR2 or CLEC10A. The specificity and binding profile of the SBT8230 antibody is identical between human and monkey (not shown).
SBT8230’s Backbone Antibody is Highly Specific to ASGR1
       The SBT8230 antibody has also been designed to recognize an epitope distinct from that bound by the ASGR1 ligand, GalNAc, allowing for possible combination of SBT8230 with GalNAc-targeted RNAi therapies currently in development for cHBV.

      Potential Mechanism of Action: SBT8230 is Designed to Localize TLR8 Activation of Myeloid Cells in the Liver Via a Directed ASGR1 Antibody 
The diagram below walks through the potential mechanism of action of SBT8230. SBT8230 is designed to be administered subcutaneously. In the liver, the ASGR1 binding domain engages hepatocytes and the Fc domain of the conjugate binds to the FcgR receptors on myeloid cells. The increase in FcgR binding avidity is a result of ASGR co-binding and results in the internalization of the conjugate into the endo-lysosome where TLR8 resides. SBT8230 directly activates myeloid cells, and these cells in turn activate anti-viral IFNg+ T cell and anti-viral B cell immune responses.

   As shown in the figures below, ASGR1-TLR8 induced IFNγ-promoting activity through activation of myeloid cells in our preclinical studies utilizing human PBMCs ex vivo. 

ASGR1-TLR8 Potently Activated Human Myeloid Cells, Resulting in a Robust IFNg Response
        Activation of human myeloid cells by TLR8 was mirrored in mouse myeloid cells by TLR7 as was previously demonstrated in our SBT6050 program. Therefore, to evaluate the ability of a liver-targeted myeloid cell agonist conjugate to drive seroconversion in a mouse model of cHBV, we engineered a surrogate for SBT8230 comprised of an anti-mouse ASGR1 monoclonal antibody conjugated to a TLR7 agonist (SBT8230-S). The antibody contained an IgG2a Fc domain to facilitate uptake into mouse myeloid cells. 
Seroconversion, together with reductions in HBsAg levels and expansion of IFNg-producing anti-viral T cells, is associated with achievement of functional cures in cHBV. The AAV-HBV (adenovirus-hepatis B virus) mouse model is a commonly used preclinical model for cHBV. Paralleling their inability to drive seroconversion in cHBV patients, cHBV standard-of-care therapies and other agents that target the HBV life cycle such as capsid inhibitors, have not resulted in seroconversion in this or similar models. In contrast, statistically significant increases in seroconversion and reductions in HBsAg were demonstrated with SBT8230-S as compared to the vehicle and unconjugated antibody control groups in the AAV-HBV model, as shown in the figures below. 

SBT8230-S Reduced HBsAg and Drove Seroconversion in Mouse AAV-HBV Model
      In addition, SBT8230-S treatment generated potent anti-viral T cell and B cell immune responses, as indicated by the significantly increased anti-HBV core and S antigen IFNg+ T cells and anti-HBsAg+ B cells, as shown in the figures below. 
SBT8230-S Increased IFNg+ Anti-Viral T Cells 

        
SBT8230-S Increased B Cells Producing Anti-HBs Antigen Antibodies 


   Importantly, as shown in the figures below, no changes in serum ALT or body weight were noted after treatment with SBT8230-S as compared to controls. In addition, there were no findings in the liver by histopathology after treatment with SBT8230-S. Together, these data indicated that SBT8230-S was well tolerated in the mouse AAV-HBV model. 
SBT8230-S was Well Tolerated in Mice
   
SBT8230 is Highly Localized to the Liver in Non-Human Primates, Suggestive of Pharmacological Activity at Low Doses in the Clinic
 SBT8230 demonstrates comparable activity on NHP immune cells, supporting the use of NHP to characterize its tolerability, efficiency of liver uptake, and ability to produce robust and localized PD effects. As shown in the figure below, SBT8230 was targeted to the liver with high efficiency in NHP. SBT8230 liver exposures (area under the curve, AUC) were over 300 times greater than serum exposures, the latter of which also displayed a very short half-life. 

SBT8230 concentration in NHP liver vs serum
       Because of the robust liver-localization of SBT8230, the systemic (serum) exposure of SBT8230 is distinct from SBT6050. As shown in the figure below, when SBT8230 and SBT6050 are dosed at equivalent dose levels, SBT8230 has far lower serum exposure than SBT6050 due to its efficient localization to liver. The mean estimated liver SBT8230 concentration at this dose in NHP was ~300-fold the maximum serum exposure, which is consistent with the reported liver to plasma exposure ratio of ~260 in NHP for the approved GalNAc-siRNA givosiran (US FDA Pharmacology Review, Givlaari). 

Serum exposures of SBT8230 vs SBT6050 in NHP

   Liver PD assessments demonstrate that the highly efficient liver uptake of SBT8230 in NHP leads to robust liver-localized PD effects. The figures below illustrate that RNA levels for multiple markers of myeloid cell activation in liver are markedly increased with SBT8230 treatment. Of note, PD effects at 0.5 mg/kg are similar overall to those at higher doses, indicating that maximal liver PD effects are achieved at this dose level. Based on the totality of our preclinical data, we believe that SBT8230 has the potential to induce pharmacological effects in the liver at doses as low as 0.03 mg/kg. This is below the lowest dose level evaluated for SBT6050, 0.15 mg/kg, that was found to be well-tolerated in patients.

SBT8230 Induced Cytokine mRNA in the Liver but not in Serum
         The non-clinical safety and tolerability of SBT8230 has been assessed in two NHP toxicity studies. In a dose range finding non-GLP study, dose levels of 6, 12 and 25 mg/kg were administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 4 doses. The 6 and 12 mg/kg dose levels were well-tolerated. At the 25 mg/kg dose level the first dose was well tolerated, but the second or third doses were associated with toxicities that included injection site reactions. This dose level is >800-fold higher than the dose noted above (0.03 mg/kg) that is expected to be pharmacologically active in patients with HBV. Across all dose levels, there were transient, dose-related hematological, clinical chemistry, and cytokine and chemokine changes reflective of the potential mechanism of action of SBT8230. There was no evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or liver enzyme elevations observed at any dose level.
SBT8230 Phase 1-Enabling Study Update
We initiated a Phase 1-enabling GLP toxicology study in the first quarter of 2022. Dose levels of 6, 12 and 18 mg/kg were evaluated on a Q2W schedule for 4 doses. The in-life portion has recently completed, and bioanalytical assessments are now in progress. SBT8230 was generally well-tolerated. Two animals out of 26, one in the 12 mg/kg group and one in the 18 mg/kg group, displayed clinical signs consistent with ADA-mediated toxicity after the fourth and third doses, respectively, and were euthanized. Repeat administration of fully human or humanized proteins, such as the mAb in SBT8230, to NHP can frequently lead to the generation of ADA and development of associated toxicities, which have been extensively investigated over the years and found to generally not be predictive of toxicities in humans (van Meer 2013; Kronenberg 2017). Similar toxicities were also observed with SBT6050 in NHP studies (at 12 mg/kg dose level), but acute ADA-mediated toxicities were not observed in patients dosed with SBT6050.
 As noted above, we believe that SBT8230 has the potential to be pharmacologically active in the liver at doses as low as 0.03 mg/kg in humans. Additional assessments (e.g., histopathology, PK, PD) are ongoing in the GLP toxicology study, and we believe that overall results of the study has the potential to provide favorable safety margins in support of the first-in-human study.


SBT8230 Next Steps
Upon completion of the GLP toxicology studies and GMP manufacturing of SBT8230, we plan to complete a Phase 1 regulatory submission in the fourth quarter of 2022, which includes an umbrella trial with a Phase 1 SAD study in healthy volunteers anticipated to start in the first half of 2023. GMP manufacturing of the antibody intermediate and ADC drug substance have been completed, with release testing in progress. Manufacturing and release of lyophilized SBT8230 drug product is on track to be completed in the third quarter of 2022. After completing the SAD study, we anticipate initiating a Phase 1 MAD study in patients with chronic HBV, who are virally suppressed on NRTI therapy.
 Additional ImmunoTAC conjugates 
In addition, our internal discovery programs are focused on evaluating and developing new antigen binding domains specific for targets of interest (including antibodies), next-generation linker technologies, and both agonist and antagonist small molecule payloads, that may be combined to create novel tissue-targeted antibody conjugates. The integration of medicinal chemistry, bioconjugation, protein engineering, bioinformatics, pharmacology, and translational medicine expertise focused on developing tissue-targeted therapies allows us to leverage key learnings from our previous clinical program to bring forward the next generation of therapeutics. We anticipate providing an update on our discovery pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2022.
 Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and dynamic, owing to rapidly advancing technologies. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that may become available in the future.
We compete with other companies working to develop immunotherapies and tissue targeted therapies for the treatment of hepatitis B virus infections, cancer, and other serious diseases, including divisions of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies of various sizes. These companies are developing therapies of many different modalities including small molecules, monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, bi-specific antibodies, cell therapies, oncolytic viruses and vaccines.
Specifically, there are many companies pursuing a variety of approaches to immune modulation and more specifically TLR-directed therapies. Companies engaging in TLR-directed therapies include Ambrx, Apros Therapeutics, Ascendis, BioNTech, Bolt Biotherapeutics, Bristol Myers Squibb, Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, CureVac, Exicure, Galderma, Gilead, Idera, Mologen, Nektar, Novartis, Primmune Therapeutics, Roche, Seven&Eight Biopharmaceuticals, Shanghai De Novo, Sumitomo Dainippon, Tallac Therapeutics, TriSalus, and UroGen. Other companies using antibody-drug conjugates to target innate immune receptors include Actym Therapeutics, Mersana, and Takeda Pharmaceuticals. Immunotherapy and validated pathway approaches are further being pursued by many smaller biotechnology companies as well as larger pharmaceutical companies. We also face competition from (i) validated pathway therapy treatments offered by companies such as AstraZeneca, Byondis, Daiichi Sankyo, Klus Pharma, MacroGenics, Pieris, Puma, RemeGen, Seagen, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, and Zymeworks; (ii) companies that continue to invest in innovation in the antibody-drug conjugate field, including but not limited to AbbVie, ADC Therapeutics, Astellas, BioAtla, Bicycle Therapeutics, Celldex, CytomX, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline, Genmab, ImmunoGen, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, MorphoSys AG, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi, Seagen, and Sutro Biopharma; and (iii) companies that are developing assets for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, which include 3SBio, AICuris, Albireo, Aligos, Allovir, Alnylam, Altimmune, Antios, Arbutus, Arcus, Arrowhead, Ascentage, Assembly Biosciences, Blue Jay Therapeutics, Bristol Myers Squibb, Door Pharmaceuticals, Enanta, ENYO Pharma, Excision Bio, Finch Therapeutics, GC Pharma, Gilead, GlaxoSmithKline, Golden Biotechnology Group, Grifols, HEC Pharm, Hepion, Immunocore, ISA pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson, Kineta, Lupin Limited, Merck, Nucorion, Replicor, Roche, SciClone Pharma, Shanghai Henlius Group, Spring Bank, Tasly, TeneoTen, TRACON, Vaccitech, VBI Vaccines, VenatoRx, Vir, VLP Biotech, and Zydus Cadila.
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, preclinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, and marketing than we do. Future collaborations and mergers and acquisitions may result in further resource concentration among a smaller number of competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.

Our commercial potential could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or make our development more complicated. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be efficacy, safety and convenience.
Manufacturing
Our antibody-drug conjugate is produced by chemical conjugation of a non-cytotoxic linker-payload to a monoclonal antibody. We have significant internal expertise in engineering and humanization of antibodies and designing linker-payloads to customize the drug conjugate for a desired target profile. The small molecule linker-payload is chemically synthesized, and the antibody is produced by conventional biological process technology. The manufacturing process involves production of the linker-payload and antibody process intermediates, the conjugation of the intermediates to produce bulk therapeutic substance, and fill/finish of the therapeutic product.
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities subject to compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). We operate on an outsourced model and rely on contracts with third-party development and manufacturing organizations designed to comply with cGMPs to produce and test the intermediates, therapeutic substance and therapeutic product to support clinical development, and commercialization, if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We are working with these manufacturers to scale up our manufacturing capabilities to support our clinical plans. We also rely on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our product candidates, as well as for our commercial products if marketing approval is obtained. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest on our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the design and development of our product candidates.
 Commercialization Plan
We intend to retain significant development and commercial rights to our product candidates and, if we obtain marketing approval, to commercialize our product candidates on our own, or potentially with a partner, in the United States and other regions. We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company commercializing products. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time for the United States, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our product candidates. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population, the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence or alter our commercialization plans.

In October 2019, we entered into a cell line license agreement with WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited (WuXi Bio), pursuant to which we received a non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain of WuXi Bio’s intellectual property rights, know-how and biological materials (WuXi Bio Licensed Technology), to make, use, sell, offer for sale and import a product developed through the use of the WuXi Bio Licensed Technology (WuXi Bio Licensed Product). The WuXi Bio Licensed Technology is used to manufacture a component of our ImmunoTAC platform.
In January 2020, we paid a license fee of $100,000 to WuXi Bio. In December 2020, we incurred an additional license fee of $50,000 to WuXi Bio. Additionally, if we do not engage WuXi Bio to manufacture the WuXi Bio Licensed Products for our clinical and commercial supplies, we are required to make milestone payments to WuXi Bio upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. Under such scenarios, upon achieving certain thresholds for the aggregate annual net sales of a WuXi Bio Licensed Product, we would owe WuXi Bio aggregate milestone payments of up to $10.8 million.
The WuXi Bio Agreement will continue indefinitely unless terminated in accordance with the agreement. The WuXi Bio Agreement may be terminated (i) by us upon six months’ written notice provided we pay all amounts due to WuXi Bio through the effective date of termination, (ii) by either party for the other party’s material breach that remains uncured for 30 days after written notice, and (iii) by WuXi Bio after 45 days’ written notice if we fail to make a payment within 30 days after receiving notice of such failure.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We own the issued patents and patent applications relating to our ImmunoTAC platform and SBT8230. Our policy includes seeking to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications, in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States, directed to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continued innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of immunotherapy. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions when available. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and know-how; to obtain and maintain licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including any patents that we may own in the future; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
As of February 28, 2022, our licensed and owned patent portfolio included five owned U.S. patents, 30 owned U.S. provisional and non-provisional patent applications, eight owned patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), 19 owned foreign patents, 118 owned foreign patent applications filed in a number of different foreign jurisdictions, including in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, European region, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Africa, directed to TLR8 agonists and conjugates, including SBT8230, TGFßR1 antagonists and conjugates, TGFßR2 antagonists and conjugates, TLR7 agonists and conjugates, and various applications of our proprietary antibody conjugates and antibodies, including antibodies specific for ASGR1, as well as certain of our other proprietary antibodies, compounds, conjugates, formulations, technology, inventions, improvements, and other product candidates. Any patents that issue from these pending patent applications will expire between March 2038 and November 2042, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. We also possess and/or in-license substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, including related manufacturing processes and technology.
Specifically, our patent portfolio includes the following families and/or groups of families:
•TLR8 Agonists and Conjugates and Combination Therapies. We have four issued U.S. patents with composition of matter, method of treatment, and method of making claims to TLR8 agonist payloads, linker-payloads and conjugates. The issued U.S. patents are projected to expire in March 2038, absent any patent term extensions. As of February 28, 2022, we have eight pending U.S. patent applications, one pending PCT application, 19 granted foreign patents, and 56 pending foreign patent applications filed in a number of different foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, European region, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan and South Africa, with composition of matter claims directed to TLR8 agonists, conjugates and formulations, including substituted TLR8 agonist variants and conjugates, as well as claims to methods of administering TLR8 agonists and conjugates, to methods of treatment with TLR8 agonists and conjugates, in combination with other therapies. Any patents that issue from these pending patent applications are projected to expire between March 2038 and October 2040, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. We own all the issued U.S. patents and all the pending patent applications in these patent families. 
 •Anti-ASGR1 Antibodies and Conjugates in Viral Infections. As of February 28, 2022, we have five pending U.S. patent applications, one pending PCT application, and 37 pending foreign patent applications filed in a number of different foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, European region, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, and South Africa, with composition of matter claims and method of treatment claims directed to our product candidate, SBT8230, including claims directed to anti-ASGR1 antibodies, anti-ASGR1 antibody conjugates to TLR8 or TLR7 agonists, as well as to methods for treating viral infection, such as chronic HBV infections. Any patents that issue from these pending patent applications will expire between December 2038 and July 2041, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. We own all the pending patent applications in these patent families.
 With respect to our product candidates and processes, we intend to develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, and we intend to pursue patent protection directed to, when possible, compositions, methods of use, methods of making, dosing, and formulations. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing, therapeutic development processes and technologies, and therapeutic delivery technologies.

Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for applications filed in the United States can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued U.S. patent that is directed to or claims an FDA approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called patent term extension. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its claims, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of immunotherapy has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and enforce the patent rights that we license, which could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, even the issued patents that we license do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and the issued patents that we in-license and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents that we own or exclusively in-license. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products, such as our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including imposition of a clinical hold, refusal to approve marketing applications, withdrawal of an approval, import/export delays, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties.
Regulatory Approval in the United States
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post- approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDCA, except the section of the FDCA that governs the approval of new drug applications, NDAs. Biological products, such as our ImmunoTAC product candidates, are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), via a biologics license application (BLA). However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
Our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines must be approved by the FDA pursuant to a BLA before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical laboratory and animal studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP requirements; 
 •submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an institutional review board (IRB) or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be commenced; 
 •completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, GCP requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
 •submission to the FDA of a BLA; 
 •payment of any user fees for FDA review of the BLA; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the filing for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic, or components thereof, will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •satisfactory completion of any potential FDA audits of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA to assure compliance with GCPs and integrity of the clinical data; 
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee; and 
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including REMS, where applicable, and post- approval studies required by the FDA as a condition of approval. 
 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.

Preclinical Studies
Before testing any biological product candidates in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product candidates and formulations, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCPs, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated in the trial. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Information about certain clinical trials, including clinical trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Disclosure of the results of these clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA. The FDA will accept a well- designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the clinical trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3:
•Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability, safety of the product candidate, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2 clinical trials generally involve studies in disease-affected patients to evaluate proof of concept and/or determine the dosing regimen(s) for subsequent investigations. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. 
 •Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the biologic. 
 These Phases may overlap or be combined. For example, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial may contain both a dose-escalation stage and a dose expansion stage, the latter of which may confirm tolerability at the recommended dose for expansion in future clinical trials (as in traditional Phase 1 clinical trials) and provide insight into the anti-tumor effects of the investigational therapy in selected subpopulation(s).

Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 and other types of clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the trial.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the investigational medicines do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
FDA Review Process
Following completion of the clinical trials, the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic or drug may be marketed in the United States. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. Under the PDUFA, each BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. The applicant under an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee.
The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA for a new molecular entity and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the BLA and may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months, depending on the type of information included. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.

   As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a REMS to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks to patients. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure a product’s safe use (ETASU). An ETASU can include, but is not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing the product, dispensing the product only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient-specific registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation on its own does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same product for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication. In the latter case, because healthcare professionals are free to prescribe products for off-label uses, the competitor’s product could be used for the orphan indication despite another product’s orphan exclusivity.
FDA’s determination of whether two ADCs are the same product for purposes of orphan drug exclusivity is based on a determination of sameness of the monoclonal antibody element and the functional element of the conjugated molecule. Two ADCs are deemed to be the same product if the complementarity determining region sequences of the antibody and the functional element of the conjugated molecule are the same. A difference in either of those two elements can result in a determination that the molecules are different.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.
Fast track designation may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic candidate can request the FDA to designate the candidate for a specific indication for fast track status concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the biologic candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s BLA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.

Breakthrough therapy designation may be granted for products that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the biologic candidate. The FDA must determine if the biological product qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review process, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to design the clinical studies in an efficient manner.
Priority review may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
Accelerated approval may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and that generally provide a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments. A product eligible for accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of diseases in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large studies to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. The accelerated approval pathway is contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. These confirmatory trials must be completed with due diligence and, in some cases, the FDA may require that the trial be designed, initiated and/or fully enrolled prior to approval. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
   Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
Additional Controls for Biologics
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), BLAs or supplements to BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. PREA generally does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted but does apply to BLAs for orphan-designated biologics if the biologic is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that the FDA has determined is substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (the BPCA) provides a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a biologic if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new biologic in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in a manner consistent with the provisions of the approved labeling. Physicians, on the other hand, may prescribe products for off-label uses. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician’s choice of drug treatment made in the physician’s independent medical judgment, they do restrict promotional communications from companies or their sales force with respect to off-label uses of products for which marketing clearance has not been issued. Companies may only share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic safety summary reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects a biologic product’s manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with required regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning or other enforcement-related letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 


Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, informally known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent term extension (PTE), however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The PTE period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA, plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for such an extension, only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any PTE or restoration. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, we or our licensors may apply for PTE for our owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. However, an extension might not be granted because of, for example, our or our licensors’ failure to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failure to apply within applicable deadlines, failure to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or any other failure to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than requested. There is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether any extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA) created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch.
A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency.
The BPCIA is complex and only recently implemented by the FDA. Recent government proposals have sought to reduce the twelve-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, a variety of foreign regulations govern clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country and the time to approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations and Legislative Reform
Healthcare and Privacy Laws and Regulations
Healthcare providers, including physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our operations, including any arrangements with healthcare providers, including physicians, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws that may affect the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would market, sell and distribute our products. Our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to CMS, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (including the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. The healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has also been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. 
 •Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, such as the FCA, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false, fictitious or fraudulent claims for payment of federal funds, and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the FCA in connection with their alleged off-label promotion of drugs, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, and allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. 
 •The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), among other things, imposes criminal liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and their respective implementing regulations, impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them, and their covered subcontractors, that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of such individually identifiable health information. 
 •Federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers. 


•The federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act), which requires, among other things, certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests, including such ownership and investment interests held by a physician’s immediate family members. 
 •Federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs. 
 •Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers. 
 •State and foreign laws that are analogous to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may impose similar or more prohibitive restrictions, and may apply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information. 
 •State and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs, comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians and other healthcare providers; state laws that require the reporting of marketing expenditures or drug pricing, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state laws that prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals; state laws that require the posting of information relating to clinical trials and their outcomes. 
 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Legislative Reform
We operate in a highly regulated industry, and new laws, regulations and judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations and decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery and payment for healthcare products and services could negatively affect our business, financial condition and prospects. There is significant interest in promoting healthcare reforms, and it is likely that federal and state legislatures within the United States and the governments of other countries will continue to consider changes to existing healthcare legislation.
For example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs such as:
•increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; 
 •established a branded prescription drug fee that pharmaceutical manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs must pay to the federal government; 
 •expanded the list of covered entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; 
 •established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 
 •extended manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; 
 •expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability; 


•created a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including our product candidates, that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 
 •established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; 
 •established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending; and 
 •created a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products. 
 There have been executive, judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, in 2017, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the Affordable Care Act will remain in effect in its current form. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. It is possible that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act. It is difficult to predict the future legislative landscape in healthcare and the effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

In addition, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In 2011, the U.S. Congress enacted the Budget Control Act, which included provisions intended to reduce the federal deficit. The Budget Control Act resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare payments to providers beginning in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, absent additional Congressional action. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In addition, in 2012, the U.S. Congress enacted the American Taxpayer Relief Act, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Moreover, any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented, or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broader deficit reduction effort or legislative replacement to the Budget Control Act, could have an adverse impact on our anticipated product revenues.


Furthermore, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA released a final rule and guidance in September 2020 providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed until January1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the Trump administration’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 27, 2021, CMS issued a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. Congress is also considering additional health reform measures. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future. It is also possible that additional governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations
We and our third-party contractors are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment, remediation and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Hazardous chemicals, including flammable and biological materials, are involved in certain aspects of our business, and we cannot eliminate the risk of injury or contamination from the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. In the event of contamination or injury, or failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, fines and penalties associated with such liability could exceed our assets and resources. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent. We may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
The availability and extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement by governmental and private third-party payors are essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive medical treatments. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our product candidates will depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors decide which products will be covered and establish reimbursement levels for those products.
Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a product is:
 a covered benefit under its health plan;
 safe, effective and medically necessary;
 appropriate for the specific patient;
 cost-effective; and
 neither experimental nor investigational.

Obtaining coverage approval and reimbursement for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost- effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement at a satisfactory level. If coverage and adequate reimbursement of our future products, if any, are unavailable or limited in scope or amount, such as may result where alternative or generic treatments are available, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. Adverse coverage and reimbursement limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in our product candidates, even if such product candidates obtain regulatory approval. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such products. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization.
There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. There is no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement in the United States and, as a result, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. In the United States, private payors often, but not always, follow Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies with respect to newly approved products. It is difficult to predict what third- party payors will decide with respect to coverage and reimbursement for fundamentally novel products such as ours, as there is no body of established practices and precedents for these new products. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for that product. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates. There can be no assurance that our product candidates will be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. In addition to third-party payors, professional organizations and patient advocacy groups can influence decisions about reimbursement for new medicines by determining standards for care. Therefore, it is possible that any of our product candidates, even if approved, may not be covered by third-party payors or the reimbursement limit may be so restrictive that we cannot commercialize the product candidates profitably.
In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics. Additionally, if any companion diagnostic provider is unable to obtain reimbursement or is inadequately reimbursed, that may limit the availability of such companion diagnostic, which would negatively impact prescriptions for our product candidates, if approved.
 Reimbursement agencies in Europe may be more restrictive than payors in the United States. In Europe, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. For example, some countries provide that products may be marketed only after an agreement on reimbursement price has been reached. Such pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Other countries require the completion of additional health technology assessments that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Within the European Union legislation relating to and regulation of the reimbursement of medicinal products, and to control the prices of such products, is a matter for individual member states. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product, may adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market or monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. Furthermore, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceutical products, and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, and prescription products in particular, has become increasingly intense. As a result, there are increasingly higher barriers to entry for new products. There can be no assurance that any country that has reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries. Accordingly, the reimbursement for any products in Europe may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits.

Furthermore, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of foreign and domestic governments as well as private third-party payors. The prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments and private third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, which could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. We also expect to experience pricing pressures due to the trend towards managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. These and other cost-control initiatives could cause us to decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in lower-than-anticipated product revenues. In addition, the publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels or if coverage and adequate reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, our revenues and the potential profitability of our product candidates in those countries would be negatively affected.
