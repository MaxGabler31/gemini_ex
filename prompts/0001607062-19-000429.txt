Corporate History 
 Generex Biotechnology Corporation (the “Company,” “Generex,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is based in Miramar, Florida, with offices in Dallas, Texas, Toronto, Canada and Wellesley, Massachusetts. The Company was originally incorporated in the state of Delaware on September 4, 1997, for the purpose of acquiring Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Canadian (Province of Ontario) corporation formed in November 1995 to engage in pharmaceutical and biotechnological research and development and other activities. The Company’s acquisition of Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc. was completed in October 1997 in a transaction in which the holders of all outstanding shares of Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc. exchanged their shares for shares of Generex common stock.
 
In January 1998, Generex participated in a “reverse acquisition” with Green Mt. P.S., Inc, (“Green Mt.”), an inactive Idaho corporation formed in 1983. As a result of this transaction, the shareholders of Generex (the former shareholders of Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc.) acquired a majority (approximately 90%) of the outstanding capital stock of Green Mt., and Generex became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Green Mt.; Green Mt. changed its corporate name to Generex Biotechnology Corporation ("Generex Idaho"), and Generex changed its corporate name to GBC - Delaware, Inc. Because the reverse acquisition resulted in GBC - Delaware, Inc. shareholders (formally Generex shareholders) becoming the majority holders of Generex Idaho, GBC Delaware, Inc. was treated as the acquiring corporation in the transaction for accounting purposes. Thus, our, GBC - Delaware, Inc. (formally Generex), historical financial statements, which essentially represented the historical financial statements of Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc., were deemed to be the historical financial statements of Generex Idaho.
 
In April 1999, we completed a reorganization in which GBC - Delaware, Inc. merged with Generex Idaho. In this transaction, all outstanding shares of Generex Idaho were converted into shares of GBC - Delaware, Inc.; Generex Idaho ceased to exist as a separate entity, and we, GBC - Delaware, Inc., changed our corporate name back to "Generex Biotechnology Corporation." This reorganization did not result in any material change in our historical financial statements or current financial reporting.
 
Following our reorganization in 1999, Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc., which was incorporated in Ontario, Canada, remained as our wholly-owned subsidiary. All of our Canadian operations are performed by Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc. is the 100% owner of 1097346 Ontario Inc., which was also incorporated in Ontario, Canada. In August 2003, we acquired Antigen Express, Inc. (“Antigen”), a Delaware incorporated company. Antigen is engaged in the research and development of technologies and immunomedicines for the treatment of malignant, infectious, autoimmune and allergic diseases. Antigen also does business under the name NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology. On February 28, 2019 Generex issued a dividend of Antigen to Generex shareholders in the amount of 1 share of Antigen for every 4 shares of Generex common stock. Generex still maintains majority control of Antigen.
 
We formed Generex (Bermuda), Inc., which is organized in Bermuda, in January 2001 in connection with a joint venture with Elan International Services, Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Elan Corporation, plc, (“Elan”) to pursue the application of certain of our and Elan's drug delivery technologies, including our platform technology for the buccal delivery of pharmaceutical products. In December 2004, we and Elan agreed to terminate the joint venture. Under the termination agreement, we retained all of our intellectual property rights and obtained full ownership of Generex (Bermuda), Inc.; Generex (Bermuda), Inc. does not currently conduct any business activities. We have additional subsidiaries incorporated in the U.S. and Canada which are dormant and do not carry on any business activities.

On November 1, 2018, we consummated the acquisition of Veneto assets (the “Second Closing Assets”), consisting primarily of Veneto’s management services organization business and other assets. The aggregate price for the First Closing Assets and the Second Closing Assets was $30,000,000. We issued a promissory note in the principal amount of $35,000,000 (the “New Note”) consisting of the $30,000,000 purchase price and a $5,000,000 original issue discount, as the sole consideration payable on the Second Closing Date. On January 15, 2019, the parties entered into an amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Amendment”) restructuring payment of the New Note.
 
On March 28, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment, a “Restructuring Agreement” with Veneto and the equity owners of Veneto to restructure the payment of the New Note that provided, in lieu of any cash payments, the Company delivered on May 23, 2019 8,400,000 shares of our common stock; plus an aggregate 5,500,000 shares of the common stock of our subsidiary, Antigen. The Veneto assets acquired by Generex included management services operations, systems, facilities, and other services.
 
On January 7, 2019, we acquired a majority interest in Regentys Corporation (“Regentys”) for an aggregate of $15,000,000, among which $400,000 was paid in cash and the remainder was paid by the issuance of a promissory note with a fair value of $14,342,414 for a total net purchase price of $14,742,414. The total fair value of the assets acquired totaled $907,883 and goodwill of $13,834,581. Installments payable under the note were tied to specific business development objectives and dates. As of October 26, 2019, an additional $850,000 was paid for a total of $1,250,000 against the note. Regentys is developing a non-surgical treatment for inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.
 
On January 7, 2019, we acquired a majority interest in Olaregen Therapeutix Inc. (“Olaregen”) for an aggregate of $12,000,000, among which $400,000 was paid in cash and the remainder was paid by the issuance of a promissory note with a fair value of $11,472,334 for a total net purchase price of $11,872,663. The total fair value of the assets acquired totaled $2,461,439 and goodwill of $9,411,224. $1,291,500 principal was paid against the note as of July 31, 2019 and an additional $500,000 was paid subsequently for a total aggregate of $1,791,500 of principal payments in addition to the $400,000 initial payment. Olaregen is launching an FDA-510(k) cleared wound care product.
 
On May 10, 2019, we acquired from a third party the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock in Olaregen in exchange for 4 million shares of the Company’s common stock, plus the issuance of a $2 million promissory note increasing our interest in Olaregen to approximately 62% of the Olaregen’s outstanding voting shares.

Business Overview 
 Our management team has embarked upon a complete strategic reorganization and transformation of the entire corporate structure, leveraging our legacy assets which have applied over $400 million dollars in developmental activities over the years, providing the Company with net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards from both United States and Canadian sources. As of July 31, 2019, the Company has significant NOL carryforwards that are described in detail in the Notes to our Financial Statements included in this 10-K. We have also formulated an acquisition strategy and identified targets to build a specialized healthcare platform with both scalability and the ability to leverage across the organization in an effort to achieve higher profit margins.
 
Since the new management team has taken over in January 2017, Generex has been reorganized as a strategic, diversified life science holding company that is actively involved in building a modern organizational platform for the financing, development,  commercialization, and distribution of promising devices, biologics, therapeutic, and diagnostic products to improve human health and return value to its investors. As the foundation for the reorganization, we are acquiring operating companies that provide multiple and significant revenue streams through delivery of patient-focused healthcare products and services, including specialty pharmacy, orthopedic implants, surgical supplies, biologics, medical devices, and regenerative medicines. These foundational acquisitions service unique market channels that provide end-to-end healthcare solutions in partnerships with patients, physicians, health systems, and payors. The synergistic business models of the combined organization offer cross channel sales opportunities for rapid growth, with significant revenues and profits projected going forward.
 Details of the Generex business strategy are provided following the discussion of the Generex historical business and our legacy assets.
 
Historical Business
 Historically, we have been a research and development company focused on the commercialization of Oral-lyn buccal insulin spray for diabetes. Additionally, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Antigen Express, we have a deep intellectual property portfolio of immunotherapy assets relating to the “Ii-Key” technology that activates the immune response for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases. We have completed a Phase IIb clinical trial of AE37 immunotherapeutic peptide vaccine with the Ii-Key technology in over 300 women with breast cancer.
 
In 2017, we acquired HDS (now NuGenerex Diagnostics) and their diagnostic product portfolio of rapid point-of-care EXPRESS test kits and cassettes for infectious disease testing.
 
We believe that these legacy diagnostics, diabetes and cancer assets are may have significant value which is not being recognized due to missteps in the clinical development process by previous management, resulting inability to raise capital necessary to fund further development. We think the products and IP portfolio retain significant value. A recently signed co-development deal with a major pharmaceutical company for AE37 in triple negative breast cancer, and a licensing deal in China for AE37 in prostate cancer illustrate the potential for AE37 immunotherapeutic vaccine. Additionally, Oral-lyn has been reformulated to enter clinical trials for Type II diabetes. The HDS EXPRESS diagnostic technology has been expanded with the new, patent-pending EXPRESS II technology and a new product pipeline. We filled our first international commercial order for 40,000 units of its NGDx -Malaria PF/PV Cassette Test Kit to Imres, BV, a Netherlands-based medical distribution company, and was recently granted a CE Mark Certification under the European Medical Devices Directive (MDD) for its The Express II Syphilis Treponemal Assay, a rapid point-of-care diagnostic assay for the detection of syphilis antibodies in primary and secondary syphilis. As part of the reorganization plan, we placed our legacy assets into separate subsidiaries under the NuGenerex family of companies, including NuGenerex Diagnostics, Nugenerex Immuno-Oncology (Antigen Express), and NuGenerex Therapeutics (Oral-Lyn and RapidMist buccal delivery technology). Our strategy is to spin out NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology as a separately traded public company, to reignite the Oral-Lyn development program with a reformulated buccal insulin spray, and to build out the diagnostics business, as detailed in the following paragraphs, however there are no assurances that we will be able to accomplish our strategic objectives.

Treatment of Legacy Assets
 Generex and its subsidiary companies have extensive patent portfolios, with intellectual property for composition of matter, formulation, design, and use in a number of therapeutic areas, across multiple indications. As described, we plan to build our legacy assets with the ultimate goal to spin-out such assets at the appropriate time, which have been incorporated into NuGenerex subsidiary companies in an effort to unlock the potential unrealized value of the intellectual property and commercial opportunities for these development companies in major markets for immuno-oncology, diabetes, and infectious disease testing:

NuGenerex
Therapeutics: Oral-lyn (Buccal Insulin) and RaidMist Buccal delivery technology
NuGenerex
Immuno-Oncology: Phase II AE37 + Keytruda in TNBC; Antigen Express (Ii-Key), Licensing, Partnerships, investor dividend
paid (1:4) for spin-out
NuGenerex
Diagnostics: NGDx Express II rapid diagnostic tests for infectious disease

 NuGenerex Therapeutics
 NuGenerex Therapeutics houses the legacy diabetes assets, Oral-Lyn and RapidMist buccal delivery technology. We believe that our buccal delivery technology is a platform technology that has application to many large molecule drugs and designed to provide a convenient, non-invasive, accurate and cost-effective way to administer such drugs. We have identified several large molecule drugs as possible candidates for development, including cannabinoid medicines. To that end we have entered into a licensing agreement with Scientus Pharmaceuticals for the use of the RapidMist technology for the administration of cannabinoids.
 
Buccal Delivery Technology and Products 
 Our buccal delivery technology involves the preparation of proprietary formulations in which an active pharmaceutical agent is placed in a solution with a combination of absorption enhancers and other excipients classified “generally recognized as safe” ("GRAS") by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) when used in accordance with specified quantities and other limitations. The resulting formulations are aerosolized with a pharmaceutical grade chemical propellant and are administered to patients using our proprietary RapidMist™ brand metered dose inhaler. The device is a small, lightweight, hand-held, easy-to-use aerosol applicator comprised of a container for the formulation, a metered dose valve, an actuator and dust cap. Using the device, patients self-administer the formulations by spraying them into the mouth. The device contains multiple applications, the number being dependent, among other things, on the concentration of the formulation. Absorption of the pharmaceutical agent occurs in the buccal cavity, principally through the inner cheek walls. In clinical studies of our flagship oral insulin product Generex Oral-lyn™, insulin absorption in the buccal cavity has been shown to be efficacious and safe. 
Buccal Insulin Product – Generex Oral-Lyn™ 

Insulin is a hormone that is naturally secreted by the pancreas to regulate the level of glucose, a type of sugar, in the bloodstream. The term “diabetes” refers to a group of disorders that are characterized by the inability of the body to properly regulate blood glucose levels. When glucose is abundant, it is converted into fat and stored for use when food is not available. When glucose is not available from food, these facts are broken down into free fatty acids that stimulate glucose production. Insulin acts by stimulating the use of glucose as fuel and by inhibiting the production of glucose. In a healthy individual, a balance is maintained between insulin secretion and glucose metabolism.

According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there are two major types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (juvenile onset diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes) refers to the condition where the pancreas produces little or no insulin. Type 1 diabetes accounts for 5-10 percent of diabetes cases (CDC). It often occurs in children and young adults. Type 1 diabetics must take daily insulin injections, typically three to five times per day, to regulate blood glucose levels. Generex Oral-lyn™ provides a needle-free means of delivering insulin for these patients.
 
According to the American Diabetes Association, in Type 2 diabetes (adult onset or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), the body does not produce enough insulin, or cannot properly use the insulin produced. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease and accounts for 90-95 percent of diabetes cases, according to the American Diabetes Association. In addition to insulin therapy, Type 2 diabetics may take oral drugs that stimulate the production of insulin by the pancreas or that help the body to more effectively use insulin. Generex Oral-lyn™ provides a simple means of delivering needed insulin to this major cohort of individuals.
 
Studies in diabetes have identified a condition closely related to and preceding diabetes, called impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). People with IGT do not usually meet the criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. They have normal fasting glucose levels but two hours after a meal their blood glucose level is far above normal. With the increase use of glucose tolerance tests the number of people diagnosed with this pre-diabetic condition is expanding exponentially. Per the 2017 Diabetes Atlas Update, published by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), approximately 40 million people in the United States and more than 425 million people world-wide suffer from IGT. Generex Oral-lyn™ is an ideal solution to providing meal-time insulin to the millions of IGT sufferers. This therapeutic area is currently being investigated.
 
There is no known cure for diabetes. The IDF estimates that there are currently approximately 382 million diabetics worldwide per their 2017 Diabetes Atlas Update and is expected to affect over 592 million people by the year 2035. There are estimated to be over 37 million people suffering from diabetes in North America alone and diabetes is the second largest cause of death by disease in North America.
 
A substantial number of large molecule drugs (i.e., drugs composed of molecules with a high molecular weight and fairly complex and large spatial orientation) have been approved for sale in the United States or are presently undergoing clinical trials as part of the process to obtain such approval, including various proteins, peptides, monoclonal antibodies, hormones and vaccines. Unlike small molecule drugs, which generally can be administered by various methods, large molecule drugs historically have been administered predominately by injection. The principal reasons for this have been the vulnerability of large molecule drugs to digestion and the relatively large size of the molecule itself, which makes absorption into the blood stream through the skin inefficient or ineffective. The RapidMist technology provides a recognized and proven drug delivery system for the delivery of large molecules directly into the blood stream with the attendant advantages.
 
Oral-lyn History
 In May 2005, we received approval from the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health for the commercial marketing and sale of Generex Oral-lyn™ for treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. We have successfully completed the delivery and installation of a turnkey Generex Oral-lyn™ production operation at the facilities of PharmaBrand in Quito, Ecuador. The first commercial production run of Generex Oral-lyn™ in Ecuador was completed in May 2006. While Ecuador production capability may be sufficient to meet the needs of South America, it is believed to be insufficient for worldwide production for future commercial sales and clinical trials.
 
On the basis of the test results in Ecuador and other pre-clinical data, we made an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) submission to Health Canada (Canada's equivalent to the FDA) in July 1998, and received permission from the Canadian regulators to proceed with clinical trials in September 1998. We filed an IND application with the FDA in October 1998, and received FDA approval to proceed with human trials in November 1998.

We began our clinical trial programs in Canada and the United States in January 1999. Between January 1999 and September 2000, we conducted clinical trials of our insulin formulation involving approximately 200 subjects with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and healthy volunteers. The study protocols in most trials involved administration of two different doses of our insulin formulation following either a liquid Sustacal meal or a standard meal challenge. The objective of these studies was to evaluate our insulin formulation's efficacy in controlling post-prandial (meal related) glucose levels. These trials demonstrated that our insulin formulation controlled post-prandial hyperglycemia in a manner comparable to injected insulin. In April 2003, a Phase II-B clinical trial protocol was approved in Canada. In September 2006, a Clinical Trial Application relating to our Generex Oral-lyn™ protocol for late-stage trials was approved by Health Canada. The FDA’s review period for the protocol lapsed without objection in July 2007.
 
In late April 2008, we initiated Phase III clinical trials in North America for Generex Oral-lyn™ with the first subject screening in Texas. Other clinical sites participating in the study were located in the United States (Texas, Maryland, Minnesota and California), Canada (Alberta), European Union (Romania, Poland and Bulgaria), Eastern Europe (Russia and Ukraine),) and Ecuador. Approximately 450 subjects were enrolled in the program at approximately 70 clinical sites around the world. The Phase III protocol called for a six-month trial with a six-month follow-up with the primary objective to compare the efficacy of Generex Oral-lyn™ and the RapidMist™ Diabetes Management System with that of standard regular injectable human insulin therapy as measured by HbA1c, in patients with Type-1 diabetes mellitus. The final subjects completed the trial in August 2011. After appropriate validation, the data from approximately 450 patients was tabulated, reviewed and analyzed. Those results from the Phase III trial along with a comprehensive review and supplemental analyses of approximately 40 prior Oral-lyn clinical studies were compiled and submitted to the FDA in late December 2011 in a comprehensive package including a composite metanalysis of all safety data. We do not currently plan to expend significant resources on additional clinical trials of Oral-lyn™ until after such time that we secure additional financing. However, we have undertaken a formulation enhancement project with the University Health Network at the University of Toronto and the University of Guelph, Ontario to increase the amount of insulin reaching the blood stream. We believe that the preliminary results from an animal study are encouraging,
 
In the past, we engaged a global clinical research organization to provide many study related site services, including initiation, communication with sites, project management and documentation; a global central lab service company to arrange for the logistics of kits and blood samples shipment and testing; an Internet-based clinical electronic data management company to assist us with global data entry, project management and data storage/processing of the Phase III clinical trial and regulatory processes. In the past, we have contracted with third-party manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of the RapidMist™ components, the insulin, and the raw material excipients required for the production of clinical trial batches of Generex Oral-lyn™.
 
Future Plans
 We have reformulated the original Oral-Lyn buccal insulin as a new patentable Oral-Lyn 2 that requires only 2 - 3 pre-prandial (before meal) sprays for the treatment of Type II diabetes. The reformulated Oral-lyn 2 was made possible by new techniques in protein chemistry and pharmaceutical formulation science, that with minimal changes in the production process and content of the components, allow the development of a new and improved, concentrated insulin formulation for improved diabetes management.
 
NuGenerex has engaged the University of Toronto’s Center for Molecular Design and Pre-formulations (CMDP) through the University Health Network with the goal of enhancing the Oral-lyn™ 2 formulation to make it more attractive to patients and prospective commercialization partners by increasing the bioavailability of insulin in the product and reducing the number of sprays required to achieve effective prandial metabolic control for patients with diabetes. Under the supervision of NuGenerex consultant Dr. Lakshmi P. Kotra, B.Pharm. (Hons), Ph.D., of CMDP, preliminary efforts succeeded in increasing the insulin concentration in the product by approximately 400 - 500% as confirmed by a variety of in vitro testing procedures, while preserving the solubility, stability, biologic activity, and potency of the insulin in the formulation.
 
NuGenerex subsequently entered into a Research Services Agreement with the University of Guelph pursuant to which Dr. Dana Allen, DVM, MSc. and Dr. Ron Johnson, DVM, Ph.D. of the Ontario Veterinary College of the University of Guelph conducted a study of the relative bioavailability of the enhanced formulation in dogs in the University’s Comparative Clinical Research Facility. The University had previously conducted the studies of the original formulation of Generex Oral-lyn™ for proof of concept, safety, and toxicity.

In the new studies, the enhanced NuGenerex Oral-lyn™ 2 formulation was compared with the original formulation in a blinded, parallel controlled study involving fasted, awake, healthy mature beagle dogs. Each dog received three sprays of either the enhanced formulation or the original formulation. Each dog was observed with assessments of serum insulin and glucose measured over a two-hour period. There were no adverse events observed in any of the animals.
 
In the dogs given the enhanced Generex Oral-lyn™ formulation (5X), there was a greater than 20-fold increase in serum insulin at 15 minutes (excluding one dog who had little response at any time point; (with dog included it was greater than 5-fold)) and almost 500% greater absorption of insulin over the two-hour test period compared to dogs given the original formulation (1X). There was a 33% decrease in serum glucose at 30 minutes in dogs treated with the enhanced Generex Oral-lyn™ formulation, compared to a 12% increase in serum glucose in dogs treated with the original formulation.
 
The results of the dog studies coupled with the positive findings from the in vitro work provide support and confidence to move forward with the remaining clinical and regulatory work necessary to achieve FDA approval of the enhanced NuGenerex Oral-lyn™ formulation through a 505(b)2 NDA.
 
The combined results provide evidence that the enhanced NuGenerex Oral-lyn™ 2 will be able to be used by people with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus as a safe, simple, fast, flexible, and effective alternative to pre-prandial insulin injections with dosing of only two to four sprays required before meals.
 
The Oral-lyn Safety Database contains information on 1,496 subjects. Eight hundred sixty-nine (869) subjects were exposed to Oral-lyn, while 627 served as Control subjects and were exposed to commercially available oral antihyperglycemics, injected insulin, or Oral-lyn placebo. There were 695 subjects in pK/pD studies (368, Oral-lyn; 327, Control) and 801 subjects in efficacy trials (501, Oral-lyn; 300, Control).
 
Two hundred seventy-two (272) Oral-lyn subjects reported at least one adverse event (132 in pK/pD studies; 140 in efficacy studies) while 278 Control subjects reported at least one adverse event (111 in pK/pD studies; 167 in efficacy studies). With respect to adverse events by Maximum Severity there appeared to be no significant differences between Oral-lyn and the Control groups in either the Efficacy or the pK studies.
 
In summary, there appear to be no indications of any significant unexpected adverse events. The expected events of hypoesthesia oral, throat irritation, dry throat, and cough were for the most part mild and could be consistent with the Oral-lyn therapy especially during the learning phase of administration. There was an indication of overlap of some of these events with multiple event terms in the constellation of upper respiratory tract infection that appeared to be balanced across therapy groups.
 
Our strategy is to revitalize our diabetes program by advancing the reformulated buccal spray Oral-lyn 2 for the treatment of Type II diabetes, and to integrate Oral-Lyn 2 therapy into our end-to-end solution for disease management through our MSO model.
 
Beyond Oral-lyn 2 for Type II diabetes, NuGenerex Drug Delivery Solutions will advance the RapidMist buccal delivery technology with additional small and large molecule drugs which will benefit from an alternative route of administration.
 
NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology (NGIO, formerly Antigen Express)
 NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology is developing immunotherapeutic products and vaccines based on our proprietary, patented platform technology, Ii-Key. The Ii-Key is a peptide derived from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II associated invariant chain (Ii) that regulates the formation, trafficking, and antigen-presenting functions of MHC class II complexes, essential for the activation of T cells in the immune response. T cells recognize antigenic epitopes when they are 'presented' to them by specific molecules, termed (MHC) on the surface of infected or malignant cells. This interaction activates the T cells, stimulating a multicellular cascade of actions that eliminates the diseased cell and protects against future disease recurrence.

--

 

When the Ii-Key peptide is linked to an antigenic epitope, it can bind to MHC Class II molecules, displacing resident antigens from the antigen binding groove, essentially 'hijacking' the MHC class II complex to present the Ii-Key epitope to selectively activate T-Cell Th1 responses, thereby increasing the intensity and duration of the immune response.
 
NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology has developed a number of Ii-Key Hybrid peptides for the immunotherapeutic targeting of tumor associated antigens (TAAs) in cancer and for vaccines against infectious diseases.
 
Ii-Key hybrid peptides can also be used to selectively activate Th2 responses and thereby induce tolerance to antigens involved in harmful immune reactions, e.g. autoimmunity, allergy, and transplant rejection.
 
AE37 – Ii-Key/HER2/neu Hybrid Immunotherapeutic Vaccine
 Our most advanced immunotherapy vaccine is AE37, an Ii-Key-Hybrid molecule that contains the HER2/neu antigenic peptide linked to the Ii-Key to enhance immune stimulation against HER2, which is expressed in numerous cancers, including breast, prostate, and bladder cancers. We have completed a Phase I clinical trial of AE37 in breast cancer: A phase Ib safety and immunology study of AE37 and GM-CSF in 16 breast cancer patients who had completed all first-line therapies and who were disease-free at the time of enrollment to the study (Holmes et al. Results of the first phase I clinical trial of the novel Ii-Key hybrid preventive HER-2/neu peptide (AE37) vaccine. J Clin Oncol 2008;26:3426-33). Furthermore, we completed a Phase IIb trial of AE37 in the prevention of cancer recurrence in women who were at high risk of recurrence after undergoing successful primary standard of care breast cancer therapies and were disease free at time of enrollment. Though the study enrolled 300 subjects, the results were not statistically significant due to a complete lack of recurrence in the 160 women with HER2-3+ positive tumors who were treated with Herceptin during primary therapy. Though the trial was not powered to evaluate the prevention of recurrence in subgroups, the trial indicated efficacy in the subset of patients diagnosed with HER2 1+, 2+, and triple negative breast cancer.
 
Based on the results from this trial, NuGenerex has entered into a collaborative agreement with Merck Sharpe & Dohme B.V. (Merck) and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Prostate Program (NSABP) to conduct a Phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AE37 in combination with the anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The trial is scheduled to begin enrolling patients in the second quarter of 2019.
 
In addition to the breast cancer program, NuGenerex has conducted a Phase I clinical trial in prostate cancer, enrolling thirty-two HER-2/neu+, castrate-sensitive, and castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients to demonstrate safety and strong immunological response to AE37. We are advancing AE37 for the treatment of prostate cancer through a licensing and  research agreement with Shenzhen BioScien  Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., for which NuGenerex has received a $700,000 upfront payment, with additional future milestone and royalty payments.
 
In exchange for exclusive rights to AE37 for prostate cancer in China, Shenzen is financing and conducting the Phase II trials in the European Union and Phase III trials globally under International Commission on Harmonisation (“ICH”) guidelines, with NuGenerex retaining the rights to all clinical data for regulatory submissions and commercialization in the rest of the world outside China.
 
Future Plans
 NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology has been established to not only to advance the NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology core technology, but also to expand our portfolio in the field of immunotherapy and personalized medicine through partnerships and acquisitions. As part of our strategy, we are planning to spin-out NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology as a separate, publicly traded entity to unlock the true value of the Ii-Key technology for our stockholders as it creates a pure play in immunotherapy, which will foster investment and collaboration.

As an initial step in accomplishing the spin-out of NGIO, on February 25, 2019, we issued a stock dividend to our shareholders, whereby our shareholders received 1 share of NGIO for every 4 shares of our stock held on the dividend date. The stock dividends will enable our stockholders to directly participate in the potentially promising future of NGIO, while creating a large shareholder base with the potential for substantial liquidity immediately upon spin-out to a national exchange, which will provide NGIO with ready access to the capital markets to finance its on-going clinical and regulatory initiatives.
 
Additionally, we are in discussions with multiple academic institutions and biotechnology development companies to acquire products and technologies to augment the NGIO development pipeline and product portfolio.
 
We plan to finalize our corporate acquisition strategy and to initiate the spin-out process for NGIO in the second quarter of 2020.
 
NuGenerex Diagnostics (formerly Hema Diagnostic Systems LLC)
 Our wholly-owned subsidiary, NuGenerex Diagnostics (formerly Hema Diagnostic Systems LLC or HDS) is in the business of developing, manufacturing, and distributing rapid point-of-care in-vitro medical diagnostics for infectious diseases. These are commonly referred as rapid diagnostic tests (“RDTs”). We manufacture and sell RDTs based upon our own proprietary EXPRESS platforms as well as standard “cassette” devices.
 
Since its founding, NuGenerex Diagnostics has been developing and continues to develop an expanding line of RDTs for infectious disease diagnosis. These include products for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, and others. These assays are all qualitative in nature and provide a simple positive or negative result directly at the clinical site. They can be used for definitive diagnosis, triage or in combination with other assays depending on which disease is being considered.
 
Each device incorporates a test strip containing reagent lines (stripes) that have been impregnated with specific antigens or antibodies that detect the target molecules specific to an infectious disease. The test strips are incorporated into our proprietary EXPRESS platforms which are easy-to-use and user-friendly diagnostic devices. There are two EXPRESS platforms; the EXPRESS and the EXPRESS II. The EXPRESS II is an upgraded version of the original EXPRESS and its use involves fewer operator steps, making it of higher clinical utility value. The Express II platform is designed to be used in a broad range of clinical and laboratory medical settings and for direct use by consumers in the home. It is simple to use, with fewer steps of operation than other rapid point-of-care tests. A single drop of blood taken by a simple finger stick is added directly to the device and the assay is activated by placing a pod of buffer solution onto the device. Results can be read in as early as 5 minutes, and no longer than 30 minutes. The accuracy of the Express II Syphilis Treponemal Assay is equal to or better than standard laboratory assays for syphilis antibodies with sensitivities and specificities of over 99%.
 
We believe that each system delivers its own advantages which enhance the use, application and performance of each diagnostic. This ease of use in the EXPRESS delivery systems is designed to ensure that our RDTs perform efficiently and effectively providing the most accurate and repeatable test results available while, at the same time, minimizing the transference of a potentially infected blood sample. The EXPRESS and cassette diagnostic kits for infectious disease testing are designed for use in resource-poor countries throughout the world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where the World Health Organization coordinates population screening for infectious diseases. We recently filled our first international commercial order for 40,000 units of its NGDx -Malaria PF/PV Cassette Test Kit to Imres, BV, a Netherlands-based medical distribution company.
 
NuGenerex Diagnostics was recently granted a CE Mark Certification under the European Medical Devices Directive (MDD) for its The Express II Syphilis Treponemal Assay, a rapid point-of-care diagnostic assay for the detection of syphilis antibodies in primary and secondary syphilis. The assay is based upon NuGenerex Diagnostic’s innovative patent pending point-of-care diagnostic platform, the Express II. The accuracy of the Express II Syphilis Treponemal Assay is equal to or better than standard laboratory assays for syphilis antibodies with sensitivities and specificities of over 99%.

With the receipt of the CE Mark Certification for its rapid point-of-care Express II Syphilis Treponemal Assay, we believe NuGenerex Diagnostics is well situated to enter into this growing syphilis testing market and will now pursue marketing efforts in Europe and, in parallel, begin plans for the filing of a 510k application with the United States FDA for marketing clearance in the United States. To this end, NuGenerex Diagnostics is fully qualified as a diagnostic test developer and manufacturer under FDA Good Manufacturing Procedures (GMP) and is certified by the International Standards Organization for the manufacture of medical devices under ISO 13485-2016 regulations.
 
NuGenerex Diagnostics has just begun a new initiative which revolves around the development of quantitative rapid diagnostic assays. These assays allow laboratory personnel and clinicians to assess the absolute amount of specific target molecules in blood or serum samples as opposed to “yes” or “no” results of qualitative RDTs. The first assay to be developed is a multiplex biomarker test for the diagnosis of sepsis and the potential differentiation of infectious sepsis from systemic immune response syndrome (SIRS).
 
We maintain an FDA registered facility in Miramar, Florida and are certified under both ISO9001 and ISO13485 for the Design, Development, Production and Distribution of the in-vitro devices. Approval of our HIV rapid test has been issued by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Additionally, some of our products qualified for and carry the European Union “CE” Mark, which allows us to enter into CE Member countries subject to individual country requirements. Currently, we have two malaria rapid tests approved under World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. This process allows expedited approval of rapid tests, reducing the current 24 -30-month process down to approximately 6-9 months. WHO approval is necessary for our products to be used in those countries which rely upon the expertise of the WHO, as well as for non-governmental organizations (“NGO”) funding for the purchase of diagnostic products.
 
We maintain current U.S. Certificates of Exportability that are issued by two FDA divisions-CBER and CDRH. CBER (Center for Biologicals Evaluation and Research) is the FDA regulatory division that oversees infectious disease diagnostic devices, including our HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C EXPRESS and EXPRESS II kits. The other division, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), is responsible for the oversight of other HDS devices which include Tuberculosis, Syphilis, and the remaining product line. Our HDS facility maintains FDA Establishment Registration status and is in accord with GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) as confirmed by the FDA.
 
We do not currently have FDA clearance to sell our products in the United States. We intend to submit selected devices to the FDA under a Pre-Market Approval Application (PMA) or through the 510K process. The 510K would require the appropriate regulatory administrative submissions as well as a limited scientific review by the FDA to determine completeness (acceptance and filing reviews); in-depth scientific, regulatory, and Quality System review by appropriate FDA personnel (substantive review); review and recommendation by the appropriate advisory committee (panel review); and final deliberations, documentation, and notification of the FDA decision. The PMA process is more extensive, requiring clinical trials to support the application. We expect to apply to the FDA for clearance of our first RDT (Express II Syphilis Treponemal Assay) for FDA 510K approval in early 2020. We anticipate the FDA process will be completed within 9 months after submission. During this timeline, we will be preparing documentation for additional rapid tests to undergo either the FDA PMA or 510k process. 
 
Future Plans 
 Generex plans to use the NuGenerex Diagnostics subsidiary to build a multi-faceted diagnostics business focused on personalized medicine. To that end, we are exploring opportunities in multiplex assays for point-of-care infectious disease testing, pharmacogenomic testing for medication management, and biomarker analysis for personalized cancer treatment, including immunotherapy.

Those organizations which invest in our new MSO model will be aligned solely with our GNBT shareholders and will receive discount codes to procure our products such as Excellagen.
 
DME-IQ

NuGenerex Distribution Solutions is planning a launch DME-IQ, a novel software as a service (SaaS) solution for physicians to manage in-office distribution of durable medical equipment (DME). DME-IQ supports the development and management of compliant and profitable in-office DME programs. DME-IQ focuses on several key areas which include negotiating on behalf of the physicians with key vendors to decrease the COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), increasing insurance collections by providing oversight of the coding during the billing process, providing the necessary personnel to manage the appeals processes, and ensuring compliance with state and federal regulations.
 
DME-IQ will automate and provide the orthopedic practices with a proprietary, tablet-based software package that immediately verifies patient benefits and eligibility. This unique system manages DME inventory, collects patient copays and deductibles, and links patient information with the DME products and necessary patient forms all in one easy to use platform.
 
The DME Market
 The US market for DME is large and growing, a result of several factors including the rising prevalence of chronic diseases requiring long-term care, the rapidly growing geriatric population, and the trend toward home healthcare services. Chronic disorders such as diabetes, diabetic foot & pressure ulcers, chronic pain, and cancer that require long-term patient care and postoperative recovery are driving demand for DME. According to a 2018 market report by Grand View Research, Inc., the US DME market is expected to reach $70.8 billion by 2025, growing at a 6.0% CAGR during the forecast period.
 
DME-IQ tracks and maintains DME inventory to ensure an adequate supply and product mix for orthopedic patient populations, and the system facilitates insurance claim submissions and adjudication to help achieve optimal reimbursements. With the DME-IQ system, the practice gains control of their DME program from an operations and financial perspective, while patients gain access to a wider variety of DME products that are custom fitted for their needs.
 
The explosion of high deductible insurance plans has resulted in a dramatic increase of patient out-of-pocket payments for care, and the subsequent requirement that physicians spend more time as collection agents rather than doctors. DME-IQ provides practice workflow solutions for DME with custom, tablet-based software that removes the administrative burden from the practice, facilitating patient eligibility review, collection of patient co-pay and deductibles, centralized insurance adjudication, DME product procurement, and other support services that allow physician practices to increase revenue and service quality. The launch of DME-IQ advances the mission of NDS to provide physicians with end-to-end solutions for patient centric care.”

Regentys Corporation
 Our majority-owned subsidiary, Regentys Corporation (formerly Asana Medical, Inc.) is a regenerative medicine company developing a tissue engineered therapy for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis. 
 
Overview
 In January 2019, we acquired a majority interest in Regentys Corporation, a Florida corporation, a development-stage regenerative medicine company. Since its formation in May 2013 as Asana Medical Inc., Regentys has been developing a first-in-class tissue engineered therapies for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and other inflammatory bowel diseases.

Ulcerative Colitis
 According to an article that was published in The Lancet on December 23, 2018 named worldwide incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease in the 21st century: a systematic review of population-based studies. (2018 Dec 23;390(10114):2769-2778), Ulcerative Colitis affects an estimated 3.2 million patients in Europe, the United States and Japan. It is a chronic, inflammatory disease that causes sores or ulcers in the lining of the large intestine (the colon). Immunological in nature, UC is thought to be facilitated by a variety of hereditary, genetic and environmental factors and it is increasingly being diagnosed in more urbanized areas. Symptoms, including urgency, bleeding, and diarrhea, that substantially affect quality of life.
Regentys™ Extracellular Matrix Hydrogel (“ECMH”)
 Regentys’ initial product, ECMH™ Rectal Solution, is a first-in-class, non-pharmacologic, non-surgical treatment option for millions of patients suffering from mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis.  Its product candidate is a powder that is reconstituted with saline and delivered as a liquid via enema. As ECMH reaches body temperature, it gels and coats the mucosal lining of the GI tract. 
 
The core technology is derived from ECM, a safe and effective FDA-approved base now extensively used for surgical applications and wound treatment. ECMH acts as a bio-scaffold, separating the damaged tissue from waste flow, covering ulcerations to limit the inflammatory response, and facilitating a healing environment using endogenous (the body’s own) stem cells.
 
Pre-Clinical Results
 Published pre-clinical results in the Journal of Crohn’s and Colitis highlight the promise of Regentys technology. Animal data show the ECMH therapy can both alleviate clinical symptoms and facilitate healing in UC patients. Previous pre-clinical ECM animal data for approved products has been shown to have a high correlation with human data.
 
Competition
 Currently four biologics are FDA-approved, including top-selling antibody medicines Humira® (adalimumab), Simponi® (golimumab), Remicade® (infliximab) and Entyvio® (vedolizumab), all of which act to suppress the pro-inflammatory protein, TNF-a (Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha), a leading cause of the proliferation of ulcerative colis and other forms of IDB. However, even with these options, more than half of all UC patients do not achieve long-term remission. Moreover, 20-30% of non-responsive patients will undergo colon removal surgery in an attempt to remediate the disease.
Regentys Advantages
 We expect our product to offer a true alternative to patients non-responsive to first line therapies such as 5-ASA. Unresponsive patients will then need to choose among therapies that alter the body’s immune system or pose long term health risks or perhaps both. Regentys’ technology is expected to enable targeted tissue healing but pose none of the health risks of more expensive market-leading biologics that generally suppress the immune system. We expect to provide our therapy at a cost less than other therapies.
Market 


18
--

 

In 2023, when we expect to receive approval, the projected drug costs for UC alone are expected to exceed $7.5B globally according to a 2017 report by Allied Market Research; including other inflammatory bowel disease indications, the global market is expected to be double the UC market. Based upon the nature of IBD, and the characteristics of Regentys’ technology, management believes variations of Regentys’ core technology will also be effective in treating IBD diseases such as Crohn’s, rectal mucositis, proctitis and anal fissures.
 
Intellectual Property 
 Regentys in-licensed patents and co-developed its technology platform with the University of Pittsburgh. It now holds patent rights in US and foreign jurisdictions, and has other global filings pending; as well, it has patent applications pending for similar indications predicated on its existing technology in other major global markets. 
Regulatory Path 

The FDA has affirmed our approach to file a 510(k) de novo application on its ECM hydrogel. We have developed a protocol and has engaged a clinical research organization to manage the conduct of its first-in-human clinical trials expected to start in Q2/Q3 2020 in Australia.  Additionally, we have engaged consultants to assist in managing the trials and regulatory approval process in Australia, the US and Europe, jurisdictions in which we initially expect to undertake clinical trials and, among other markets, where it will first seek governmental approval to promote and sell medical devices.
Product Development 
 Since 2013, we have maintained a research and development agreement with the University of Pittsburgh supplemented with personnel from the affiliated McGowan Institute of Regenerative Medicine. In February 2018, Regentys entered into a development agreement with (and has received a co-investment by) Cook Biotech, Inc., a global leader in ECM manufacturing technology (CookBio). Product batches now on hand are expected to be sufficient for additional development and testing. A larger clinical batch with finalized specifications will be generated in the coming months for use in clinical trials. There are alternate providers of development services who can assist with product development activities. Notwithstanding these options, management believes that because of the nature of ongoing development activities, and the reliance upon certain bench and manufacturing processes and ECM product expertise and technology, any interruption in the development relationship with CookBio would subject the Company to substantial expenditures of time and cost to duplicate the product.
Manufacturing 

Regentys has an exclusive manufacturing agreement with CookBio for the production of biomaterial and use of its proprietary technology conditioned upon the completion of final product development work. Management has negotiated an agreement with a third-party manufacturer for product components and kitting. We believe that there are alternate sources of these manufacturing and supply services. However, because of the nature of regulation in the medical device industry, and the reliance upon the collection, reporting and management of medical device manufacturing data, a change of manufacturer would substantially impact the time and cost required for clinical product production and regulatory compliance.
Financing 
 In January 2019, Regentys was acquired by Generex for an aggregate purchase price of $15,000,000, with $400,000 paid in upfront cash up-front and a promissory note of $14,600,000. Installments payable under the note were tied to specific business development objectives and dates. As October 3, 2019, an additional $850,000 was paid for a total of $1,250,000 against the note. Regentys entered into an accommodation agreement dated March 14, 2019 with Generex to provide longer time to pay. While Generex has not timely made the required payments as of the date this 10-K is filed, Management believes that payments now due will provide sufficient and timely funding to undertake and finalize its first-in-human clinical trials and to acquire one or more regulatory approvals to market and sell our products in Australia, the US and/or the EU.

Operations 
 Currently, Regentys employs four full-time contract employee and several part-time consultants. We supplement our business operations by engaging external legal (intellectual property, corporate and health care), accounting and tax professionals. We also have contracted with information services, regulatory and clinical trial companies who make available professionals to manage the information services, regulatory, clinical, and compliance aspects of the business. Upon payment of the interim note, Regentys will formally add two contract employees, additional administrative staff and a third-party provider to assist with employee payroll and benefits as well as undertake clinical trial activities suing external support.
NuGenerex Surgical Products
 Pantheon Medical – Foot & Ankle, LLC and MediSource Partners, LLC
 Pantheon Medical is a manufacturer of orthopedic foot & ankle surgery kits that offer physician friendly “all-in-one,” integrated surgical kits that include plates, screws, and tools required for orthopedic surgeons and podiatrists conducting foot and ankle surgeries.
 
MediSource Partners is a 10-year old private company that is an FDA registered distributor of surgical, medical, and biologic supplies, with over 25 vendor contracts for nationwide distribution of implants and devices for spine, hips, knees, foot, ankle, hand, and wrist surgeries. Additional product lines include biologics (blood, bone, tissue, stem cells), durable medical equipment, and soft goods. We maintain partnerships and contracts with hospital systems for ordering, billing and inventory management.
 
The acquisitions of Pantheon and MediSource were finalized on August 1, 2019, immediately subsequent to the end of our 2019 fiscal year. MediSource Partners has contracts with over 25 vendors (including Pantheon Medical) for distribution of:
 
• | Implants and devices 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | Biologics (blood, bone, tissue, and stem cells) 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Durable medical equipment 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Soft Goods 
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Kits to process bone marrow aspirates and platelet rich plasma biologics 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Historical Background
 MediSource Partners was founded in 2009 and designed to be unique amongst its competitors by operating as a service-focused, “one stop shop” for the healthcare professionals it serves. With over 25,000 products in its catalogue, including thirteen (13) lines dedicated to spine, MediSource prides itself on its ability to service everything from small private practices across several disciplines, to entire hospital systems. The large and broad-based inventory allows our client physicians to “customize” their operating environment by selecting and implementing the hardware, biologics, soft goods and ancillary tools they feel most confident in and comfortable with. In addition, the “one stop shop” model reduces the burden placed on support staff tasked with managing multiple reps from multiple vendors and shortens the distribution chain to reduce costs and potential redundancies. The success of this model is demonstrated in MediSource’s ability to offer this client-focused, low-impact service at a pricing matrix often below even standard GPO pricing, thus increasing client profitability and productivity.
 
Pantheon Medical was founded in 2014 to build a manufacturing company with proprietary product lines that offer convenience and cost effectiveness to physicians. Pantheon is contracted with MediSource Partners for nationwide distribution of its proprietary “All-in-One” Foot & Ankle Surgery Kit.

Product Development
 Pantheon Medical – Foot & Ankle, LLC is developing proprietary surgical systems to expand the product line. Over the next three years Pantheon will be developing three new product lines for submission to the FDA for 510K clearance, including Cannulated Screws, a Hammertoe System and Surgical Staples. Additionally, MediSource Partners will distribute a line of regenerative medicine products under development by an affiliated organization licensed for the production of biologics, including umbilical cord blood and Wharton’s Jelly (rich sources of stem cells), mesenchymal stem cells, and human placental derived tissue factors, primarily exosomes.
 
The acquisitions of Pantheon and MediSource Partners expands the commercial product portfolio of Generex into the surgical field, adding revenues and profits with their current product line and significant upside opportunities for new FDA-approved product introductions over the next several years. The MSO partners in NuGenerex Distribution Solutions, many of whom are orthopedic surgeons and podiatrists, will immediately benefit from Pantheon’s Foot & Ankle surgery kit.
 
NuGenerex Health, LLC
 In addition to our efforts in orthopedic medicine, we are currently in the process of setting up NuGenerex Health MSO to provide ancillary health services in partnership with Arizona Endocrinology Center and Paradise Valley Family Medicine, two major physician practices that care for a population of ~65,000 patients, approximately 25,000 of whom are insulin dependent diabetics with chronic care needs. With an initial focus on the management of complex diabetes patients, NuGenerex Health will offer ophthalmology, podiatry, chronic care management (CCM) services to provide patients with integrated, concierge care to improve outcomes and reduce costs. NuGenerex Health will employ ophthalmologists, podiatrists, and medical staff to provide ancillary health services for chronic care diabetes patients in support of the endocrinology and family medicine practices. By bringing the specialty ancillary care directly to the patients who regularly visit the clinic, NuGenerex Health provides an integrated, collaborative care model to not only enhance patient wellbeing, but also to comply with CMS guidelines for diabetes and chronic care management that can lead to 5-star ratings and increased reimbursements.
 
Ophthalmology
 Regular eye exams for persons diagnosed with diabetes mellitus are important for detecting potentially treatable vision loss. Monitoring, surveillance, and evaluation of visual health are widely recognized as prerequisites for effective, accessible, and high-quality individual and population-based health services.
 
Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) covers preventive and diagnostic eye exams as part of a comprehensive diabetes care plan, with reimbursements averaging $215 per patient for standard eye exam with accompanying tests for glaucoma and macular degeneration.
 
Podiatry
 According to an article that was published in Therapeutics Advances Endocrinology & Metabolism, Financial burden of diabetic foot ulcers to world: a progressive topic to discuss always(2018 Jan; 9(1): 29–31.), as diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are the leading cause of non-traumatic lower extremity amputation costing an estimated $13 billion annually, CMS promotes preventive and diagnostic foot exams by a podiatrist, with reimbursement rates averaging $175 for a new patient evaluation, and $150 for follow up. Under the CMS guidelines, patients are eligible for diabetic foot exams every six months.
Chronic Care Management (CCM)
 According to the CDC an estimated 117 million adults have one or more chronic health conditions, and 2/3 of Medicare patients have 2 or more chronic conditions. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) made benefit payments of $583 billion in 2018, with chronic care patients accounting for 99% of expenditures. Recognizing chronic care management (CCM) as a critical component of health care, CMS has established reimbursement codes to promote adoption in the marketplace, including significant improvements in 2017 that increased payment amounts and introduced new billing codes. NuGenerex Health is designed to provide comprehensive ancillary services to fill the current gaps in care that lead to significant morbidity and astronomical costs of diabetes.

 GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 Regulatory Considerations for Generex
 
Our research and development activities and the manufacturing and marketing of our medical device, biologic, and pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States, Health Canada in Canada, the EMEA in Europe, and comparable designated regulatory authorities in other countries. Among other things, extensive regulations require us to satisfy numerous conditions before we can bring products to market. While these regulations apply to all competitors in our industry, having a technology that is unique and novel extends the requisite review period by the various divisions within the FDA and other regulators. Also, other companies in our industry are not limited primarily to products which still need to be approved by government regulators, as we are now.

If requisite regulatory approvals are not obtained and maintained, our business will be substantially harmed. In many cases, we expect that extant and prospective development partners will participate in the regulatory approval process. The following discussion summarizes the principal features of food and drug regulation in the United States and other countries as they affect our business. 
 United States 
 All aspects of our research, development and foreseeable commercial activities relating to medical device, biologic, and pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States. United States federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products. The regulatory approval process, including clinical trials, usually takes several years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. If regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may include significant limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed.
 
The steps required before a medical device, biologic or pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States include:
 

• | Conducting appropriate pre-clinical laboratory evaluations, including animal studies, in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) requirements, to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product, and to characterize and document the product’s chemistry, manufacturing controls, formulation and stability; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submitting the results of these evaluations and tests to the FDA, along with manufacturing information, analytical data, and protocols for clinical studies, in an IND Application, and receiving approval from the FDA that the clinical studies proposed under the IND are allowed to proceed; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Obtaining approval of Institutional Review Boards (“IRBs”) to administer the product to humans in clinical studies; conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in compliance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements that establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the intended use; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing manufacturing processes which conform to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, as confirmed by FDA inspection; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submitting to the FDA the results of pre-clinical studies, clinical studies, and adequate data on chemistry, manufacturing and control information to ensure reproducible product quality batch after batch, in an NDA, a 510(k), PMA or Biologics License Application (“BLA”); and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Obtaining FDA approval of the NDA, BLA, PMA, or 510(k) including inspection and approval of the product manufacturing facility as compliant with cGMP requirements, prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the pharmaceutical agent. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Quality and pre-clinical tests and studies include: laboratory evaluation of Drug Substance and Drug Product chemistry, formulation/manufacturing, and stability profiling, as well as a large number of animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of each product. 
 

23
--

 

The results of the quality and pre-clinical tests/studies, in addition to any non-clinical pharmacology, are submitted to the FDA along with the initial clinical study protocol (see descriptive of process below) as part of the initial IND and are reviewed by the FDA before the commencement of human clinical trials. Unless the FDA objects to it, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. The FDA reviews all protocols, protocol amendments, adverse event reports, study reports, and annual reports in connection with a new pharmacological product.
 
The IND for our oral insulin formulation became effective in November 1998. Amendments are also subsequently filed as new Clinical Studies and their corresponding Study Protocols are proposed. In July 2007, we received a no objection clearance to initiate our Phase III study protocol for our oral insulin product.
 
The Physician’s Investigational New Drug Application for the Phase I and Phase II trial of AE37, Antigen’s synthetic peptide vaccine designed to stimulate a potent and specific immune response against tumors expressing the HER-2/neu oncogene, in patients with stage II HER-2/neu positive breast cancer became effective in March 2006. 
 
The Investigational New Drug Application for the Phase II trial of AE37 in combination with pembrolizumab (Merck’s Keytruda) for treatment of triple negative breast cancer became effective in December 2018, and the trial is expected to begin enrolling patients in the second quarter of 2019.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of a new drug to humans under the supervision of qualified investigators. The protocols for the trials must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Also, each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an IRB, which considers, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution conducting the clinical trials.
 
Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases (Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III), but the phases may overlap. Phase I clinical trials test the drug on healthy human subjects for safety and other aspects, but usually not effectiveness. Phase II clinical trials are conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the efficacy of the drug for specific purposes, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosages, and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. When a compound has shown evidence of efficacy and acceptable safety in Phase II evaluations, Phase III clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate and confirm clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at clinical trial sites in different geographical locations.  The FDA and other regulatory authorities require that the safety and efficacy of therapeutic product candidates be supported through at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials (known as “Pivotal Trials”).  The successful completion of Phase III clinical trials is a mandatory step in the approval process for the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of products.
 
In the United States, the results of quality, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, if successful, are submitted to the FDA in an NDA to seek approval to market and commercialize the drug product for a specified use. The NDA is far more specific than the IND and must also include proposed labeling and detailed technical sections based on the data collected. The FDA is governed by the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) regarding response time to the application, which is generally 12 months (and shorter for a priority application). It may deny a NDA if it believes that applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. The FDA also may require additional clarifications on the existing application or even additional testing for safety and efficacy of the drug. We cannot be sure that any of our proposed products will receive FDA approval. The multi-tiered approval process means that our products could fail to advance to subsequent steps without the requisite data, studies, and FDA approval along the way. Even if approved by the FDA, our products and the facilities used to manufacture our products will remain subject to review and periodic inspection by the FDA.
 
To supply drug products for use in the United States, foreign and domestic manufacturing facilities must be registered with, and approved by, the FDA. Manufacturing facilities must also comply with the FDA's cGMPs, and such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA. Products manufactured outside the United States are inspected by regulatory authorities in those countries under agreements with the FDA.  To comply with cGMPs, manufacturers must expend substantial funds, time and effort in the area of production and quality control.  The FDA stringently applies its regulatory standards for manufacturing. Discovery of previously unknown problems with respect to a product, manufacturer or facility may result in consequences with commercial significance. These include restrictions on the product, manufacturer or facility, suspensions of regulatory approvals, operating restrictions, delays in obtaining new product approvals, withdrawals of the product from the market, product recalls, fines, injunctions and criminal prosecution.

One final hurdle that is closely associated with the cGMP inspections is the pre-approval inspection that the FDA carries out prior to the issuance of a marketing license. FDA inspectors combine cGMP compliance with a review of research and development documents that were used in the formal NDA. A close inspection of historic data is reviewed to confirm data and to demonstrate that a company has carried out the activities as presented in the NDA. This is generally a long inspection and requires a team of individuals from the Company to “host” the FDA inspector(s).
 
Foreign Countries

Before we are permitted to market any of our products outside of the United States, those products will be subject to regulatory approval by foreign government agencies similar to the FDA.  These requirements vary widely from country to country. Generally, however, no action can be taken to market any drug product in a country until an appropriate application has been submitted by a sponsor and approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. Again, similar to the FDA, each country will mandate a specific financial consideration for the Marketing Application dossiers being submitted. Although an important consideration, FDA approval does not assure approval by other regulatory authorities. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. We have received a number of foreign regulatory approval for the first generation Oral-lyn buccal insulin and over-the-counter products in the past, however, Oral-Lyn was never launched, and we are not manufacturing, marketing, nor distributing products in these regions based upon these approvals.
 
In May 2019, NuGenerex Diagnostics (formerly HDS) filled an international order for 40,000 units of its malarial diagnostic product, The NGDx -Malaria PF/PV Cassette Test Kit to Imres, BV, a Netherlands-based medical distribution company. The kits were part of a World health Organization contract. That contract is fulfilled, and the contract has expired.
 
We have relocated our headquarters from Canada to the United States, but we maintain our Canadian entity, Generex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. This entity contains all the intellectual property (IP) for the entire history of our Oral-Lyn diabetic products and patents for buccal delivery. There are no live operations in Canada, but we continue with an office. Also, temporarily, as we continue to transition GNBT into a major company again, our Banking Operations are housed at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and will be replaced by a USA based public company treasury platform with JP Morgan Chase. This entity also holds a significant Canadian NOL of value to be used upon the reactivation of operations once funded.
 
We have a few international initiatives that we continue to pursue in regard to development of new drugs, however, no international clinical trials are currently being conducted. Moving forward, we will pursue international development of promising drug candidates, with the goal of out-licensing those products to local companies or to international pharmaceutical companies for marketing and distribution in those countries, particularly in the European Union and Japan represent major markets for pharmaceutical and diagnostic products. To that end, we are in frequent contact with international countries with interests in licensing agreements with us on some of our products. Currently we have a licensing agreement with Shen Zhen BioScien for the rights to our cancer vaccine AE37 for the treatment of prostate cancer in China.

NuGenerex Diagnostics Regulatory Considerations 
 The manufacturing and marketing of our existing and proposed diagnostic products are regulated by the FDA and comparable regulatory bodies in other countries. Our products are also regulated by, subject to approval by, or must meet standards set by, of certain non-governmental organizations involved in the purchase and distribution of products like ours. These regulations and standards govern almost all aspects of development, production and marketing, including product testing, authorizations to market, labeling, promotion, manufacturing and record keeping.  
 
Commercialization of medical devices in the European Union requires meeting the regulatory guidelines of the European Medical Devices Directive (MDD) and fulfillment of those requirements allows a device to carry the “CE-Mark” as verification of its diagnostic authenticity.
 
FDA regulated products require some form of action by that agency before they can be marketed in the United States, and, after approval or clearance, we must continue to comply with other FDA requirements applicable to marketed products, e.g. Quality Systems (for medical devices).  Failure to comply with the FDA’s requirements can lead to significant penalties, both before and after approval or clearance.
 
There are two review procedures by which medical devices can receive FDA clearance or approval.  Some products may qualify for clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, in which the manufacturer provides a pre-market notification that it intends to begin marketing the product, and shows that the product is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed product (i.e., that it has the same intended use and is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness).  In some cases, the submission must include data from human clinical studies.  Marketing may commence when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding such substantial equivalence.  
 
If the medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) procedure (either because it is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device or because it is required by statute and the FDA’s implementing regulations have an approved application), the FDA must approve a Pre-Marketing Application (“PMA") before marketing can begin.  PMA’s must demonstrate, among other matters, that the medical device provides a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.  A PMA application is typically a complex submission, including the results of non-clinical and clinical studies.  Preparing a PMA application is a much more expensive, detailed and time-consuming process as compared with a 510(k) pre-market notification.  
 
In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices that have not been cleared for marketing in the United States.  The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act contains general requirements for any medical device that may not be sold in the United States and is intended for export.  Specifically, a medical device intended for export is not deemed to be adulterated or misbranded if the product: (1) complies with the specifications of the foreign purchaser; (2) is not in conflict with the laws of the country to which it is intended for export; (3) is prominently labeled on the outside of the shipping package that it is intended for export; and (4) is not sold or offered for sale in the United States.  However, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act does permit the export of devices to any country in the world, if the device complies with the laws of the importing country and has valid marketing authorization in one of several " listed " countries under the theory that these listed countries have sophisticated mechanisms for the review of medical devices for safety and effectiveness.

We are also subject to regulations in foreign countries governing products, human clinical trials and marketing, and may need to obtain approval or evaluations by international public health agencies, such as the World Health Organization, in order to sell diagnostic products in certain countries.  Approval processes vary from country to country, and the length of time required for approval or to obtain other clearances may in some cases be longer than that required for United States governmental approvals.  On the other hand, the fact that our HIV diagnostic tests are of value in the AIDS epidemic may lead to some government process being expedited.  The extent of potentially adverse governmental regulation affecting HDS that might arise from future legislative or administrative action cannot be predicted.
 
Our products may rely on international regulatory approvals for sale into markets outside of the USA, and, domestically, our devices would require US FDA clearance and, in some cases, WHO Listings.
 
It is our intent to focus on both the domestic and international regulatory approvals. 
 
Domestically, we intend on submitting our devices to the FDA under a Pre-Market Approval Application (PMA) or through the 510K process. The 510K would require the appropriate regulatory administrative submissions as well as a limited scientific review by the FDA to determine completeness (acceptance and filing reviews); in-depth scientific, regulatory, and Quality System review by appropriate FDA personnel (substantive review); review and recommendation by the appropriate advisory committee (panel review); and final deliberations, documentation, and notification of the FDA decision. The PMA process is more extensive, requiring clinical trials to support the application. We expect to apply to FDA for approval of our first Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) to be submitted to the FDA for 510K approval within the next 3 months. We anticipate the FDA process will be completed within 12-18 months after submission. 
 
Internationally, we intend on submitting our EXPRESS devices and cassettes to the WHO procurement listing process which requires a full regulatory and quality documentation dossier, produced and compiled by the Company. WHO process requires laboratory testing and evaluation and then may require clinical trials for public deployment and documentation throughout the whole process. 
 
        Once the WHO process is complete and documented, there is a submission into the Global Fund, which is a partnership between governments, civil society, the private sector and people affected by infectious diseases specifically HIV/AIDs, tuberculosis, and malaria.
 
The Global Fund raises and invests nearly $4 billion a year to support programs run by local experts in countries that are most in need.
 
        It is our intent to submit selected cassettes and EXPRESS RTDs to the FDA, WHO and the Global Fund for regulatory review.
 
Currently, both our cassette malaria pF and malaria pF/pV have been listed under the WHO procurement process. 
 
Regulatory considerations for the NuGenerex Family of Companies
 Our business is subject to highly complex United States federal and state regulations that may impact our ability to fully implement our strategic plans and initiatives. We are required to obtain and hold licenses and permits and to comply with the regulatory requirements of various governmental agencies. If we fail to comply with such regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply with such regulations, the economic viability of our Company may be adversely affected.

FDA Regulations
 The manufacturers and suppliers of the products we market are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, other federal governmental agencies, and state authorities. These laws and regulations govern the approval of, clearance of, or license to commercialize medical devices (such as Orthopedic Implants), Biologics, and drugs. This includes compliance with the standards and requirements related to the design, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, and sales of the products, record keeping requirements, tracking of devices, reporting of potential product defects and adverse events, conduct of corrections, and recalls and other matters. As a distributor, marketer, and now, an FDA-registered medical device specification developer and repackager/relabeler of such FDA-regulated products, we are subject to independent requirements to register and list certain products. We may be required to obtain state licensure or certifications and we may be subject to inspections, in addition to complying with requirements that apply to the manufacturers of the products we market. Failure to comply with those applicable requirements could result in a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from warning letters to more severe sanctions such as fines, civil penalties, operating restrictions, injunctions, and criminal prosecutions. To support our Biologics product lines, we are a registered establishment with the FDA for the storage and distribution of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps).
 
Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 We are required to comply with federal and state healthcare laws and regulations. Such healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to the relationships that we and our distributors have with healthcare professionals and entities, such as physicians and hospitals. U.S. federal health care laws including laws related to false claims, health care fraud and abuse, physician self-referrals, and anti-kickbacks apply when we or are customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federally-funded health care programs (such as Medicare or Medicaid). In comparable fashion, state health care laws of a similar nature apply to state-funded health care programs and may also apply with private third-party payors. The requirements of these laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to federal or state government investigations, substantial fines, exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs, and civil or criminal sanctions. Such sanctions and damages could adversely affect the economic viability of our Company.
 
We instituted a company-wide compliance program for all employees, vendors, and contractors. During 2018, we hired a compliance officer who is responsible for developing compliance programs, reviewing our policies, overseeing adherence to those policies, and advising management on possible risks. Our policies related to this realm include general ethical business practices as well as specific operating policies and training to ensure compliance with relevant and applicable healthcare laws and regulations that include the laws referenced above in addition to other applicable laws, such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPPA”) and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act.
 
NuGenerex Distribution Solutions and MSO Regulatory Considerations
 NuGenerex Distribution Solutions has operated under strict federal and state guidelines across several of the product and service lines offered by the Company. In particular, the NuGenerex MSO is regulated at the state level, where the physician-owned management services organization (MSO) has been deemed by our healthcare attorneys to be legally compliant in 27 states. The NuGenerex MSO operates in compliance with all laws and regulations as detailed below:
 
We believe that the following statements support an assertion that the ownership structure of the Company and the proposed arrangement as a whole is structured to comply with some of the recommendations set forth by the OIG in the Bulletin, the Special Fraud Alert and other guidance:
 

• | Each investor will have made a financial investment in a bona fide business venture organized for the primary purpose of performing certain contracted services for the benefit of a Contracted Ancillary Provider; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If an investor receives any distributions, such distributions will be made solely on the basis of such investor’s proportionate ownership of the Company, and not on the basis of referrals by any individual or class of investors or the revenues generated by referrals from such investor; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Subscriptions for ownership of the Company will not be accepted or rejected on the basis of expected volume of referrals or amount of business otherwise generated for the Company or indirectly a Contracted Ancillary Provider by the subscriber; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There is no requirement that an investor make referrals to, or otherwise generate business for, a Contracted Ancillary Provider, NuGenerex or the Company as a condition of participation in the Company. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


28
--

 

Some of the most applicable health care related laws, rules, and regulations to the company are, including but not limited to, the following:
 
Stark Laws
 
The types of financial arrangements between a physician and an entity that trigger the self-referral prohibitions of the Stark Law are broad and include direct and indirect ownership and investment interests and direct and indirect compensation arrangements. We do not believe that the Stark Law will be applicable to the Company or any Physician Member because neither we nor any Physician Member intends to make any referral to a Contracted Ancillary Provider (as hereinafter defined) for the furnishing of any ancillary healthcare services for which payment may be made under the Medicare or Medicaid programs.
 
We do not believe the Subcontracted Services Agreement creates a direct financial relationship between the Physician Members (or their professional organizations) and a Contracted Ancillary Provider because (i) the Vendor Services Agreement is between NuGenerex on the one hand, and a Contracted Ancillary Provider on the other and (ii) the Subcontracted Services Agreement is between the Company on the one hand and NuGenerex on the other. Further, we believe that the Subcontracted Services Agreement, as structured, complies with the Stark Law exception for personal services should any enforcement authorities or agencies take the position that the Physician Members have a direct financial relationship with a Contracted Ancillary Provider. Further, we believe the arrangements meet the Stark Law exception for personal services.
 
The Anti-Kickback Statue
 
The federal anti-kickback statute, (the “Anti-Kickback Statute”), makes it a felony to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive any remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in exchange for, referrals of business reimbursed under federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
         We do not believe that the Anti-Kickback Statute will be applicable to the Company or any Physician Member because neither we nor any Physician Member intends to make any referral of business to a Contracted Ancillary Provider reimbursed under any federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. 
 
False Claims Act
 
The False Claims Act is a civil statute used as a primary tool for recovering monies from health care entities who have committed fraud against the federal government.
 
We do not intend to receive any compensation that is related to the referral of patients covered by any federal healthcare program, including Medicare and Medicaid. We also plan to take precautions to avoid any activity that could be considered civil or criminal false claims.
 
Civil Monetary Penalty Statute
 
The Civil Monetary Penalty Statute prohibits a health care provider from knowingly making a payment, directly or indirectly, to a physician as an inducement to reduce or limit services to Medicare or Medicaid patients under the physician’s direct care. We do not believe that the Civil Monetary Penalty Statute will be applicable to the Company or any Physician Member because neither we nor any Physician Member intends to make any referral of business to a Contracted Ancillary Provider reimbursed under the Medicare or Medicaid programs.

NuGenerex Distribution Solutions Other Regulatory Considerations
  Each state has its own statutes and regulation governing relationships among healthcare providers, including ant-kickback, limitations on referral fees and similar issues. Other states may have more restrictive laws which would make pursuing our business plan more difficult. Given that we stared in Texas the following are examples of the types of state by state regulations which will govern us.
Texas Patient Non-Solicitation Act
 
The Texas Patient Non-Solicitation Act prohibits anyone from intentionally or knowingly offering to pay or agreeing to accept any remuneration (directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, or in cash or in kind) to or from anyone else for securing or soliciting patients for or from a person licensed, certified or registered by a Texas healthcare regulatory agency. Unlike the Stark Law and the Anti-Kickback Statute that only apply to payments by federal government programs, the Texas Patient Non-Solicitation Act applies to all payers, including private insurance companies. As a means of balancing this broad application, however, the Texas Patient Non-Solicitation Act provides that compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes compliance with the Texas Patient Non-Solicitation Act.
 
Because the Texas statute provides that compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes compliance with the Texas Patient Non-Solicitation Act, the analysis of the Company under the Texas Patient Non-Solicitation Act is essentially the same as the analysis under the Anti-Kickback Statute.
 
Texas Fee Splitting
 
The Texas Medical Practice Act prohibits fee-splitting and other unprofessional conduct. Any physician who is found to have violated the Texas Medical Practice Act may be subject to criminal sanctions or loss of such physician’s license to practice medicine. Prospective physician investors are advised to consult their personal counsel regarding the potential impact of this statute on their individual circumstances.
Texas Commercial Bribery Statute
 
The Texas Commercial Bribery Statute makes it a criminal violation for anyone, including a physician, acting without the consent of their patient, to accept any benefit from another person or entity to influence such physician’s conduct toward the patient. A violation of the commercial bribery law could result in a physician’s loss of license to practice medicine in Texas.
 
The risk of violation of both the commercial bribery and the non-solicitation of patient’s statutes will be significantly reduced if the patient of a Physician Member, prior to receiving services from a Contracted Ancillary Provider, is informed of the Physician Member’s ownership in the Company and its indirect financial relationship with a Contracted Ancillary Provider.
 MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION 
 Generex Historical Business Marketing & Distribution 
 Historically, Generex had marketing agreements with international distribution companies for distribution of Oral-Lyn in approved territories. Those agreements are no longer in effect.
 
Currently, as clinical stage development companies, neither NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology (formerly Antigen Express) nor NuGenerex Therapeutics (Oral-Lyn and RapidMist buccal delivery system) markets or distributes any products.

NuGenerex Diagnostics Marketing & Distribution
Sales of the NuGenerex Diagnostics EXPRESS line of diagnostic kits for infectious diseases is dependent on regulatory approvals issued by such agencies as the WHO, FDA and registration with the Global Fund. These approvals are a key element in the sales and marketing effort on an international basis. We will work with these organizations as well as governmental agencies in target countries and commercial companies.
 
WHO-Listed 
 Following the successful fulfillment of previous PFSCM (Partnership for Supply Chain Management) and WHO shipments, HDS continues to participate in requests for proposals from PFSCM for our currently WHO-approved HDS Malaria test. All of the HDS Malaria RDT’s are on the WHO procurement list.
 
We will also participate in the newly designed and recently announced WHO Pre-Qualification Program for Malaria RDTs. It is our intention to present the new Malaria EXPRESS II devices for Pf, Pf/Pv and Pf/Pan for this Pre-Qualification Program. 
 
NGDx EXPRESS II - Syphilis
 In January 2019, NuGenerex Diagnostics received CE Marking Certification for its rapid point-of-care Express II Syphilis Treponemal Assay from the European Union. We are currently seeking a distribution partner to launch the test in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 
Olaregen Marketing & Distribution
 Olaregen has established a team of internal sales and marketing professionals who oversee the marketing, sales & distribution for Excellagen. Currently the product is sold and marketed in the United States. Olaregen Therapeutix Inc. plans to focus its efforts on selling to the Veterans Affairs (VA) system, surgeons, dermatologists, and in phase II to wound care centers and nursing homes. These are important market segments since approximately ~80-90% of patients that qualify for using Excellagen are treated in these centers and nursing homes. Excellagen can be used for nearly all wound indications but management plans to focus on difficult to manage wounds including Diabetic, Venous and Arterial ulcers initially as well as Post Moth’s surgery, Operating Rooms (OR) and Ambulatory Care Surgeries with all these indications being extremely prevalent, most significantly amongst the elderly.
 
Olaregen is signing intra-company agreements with partner companies in the NuGenerex family of companies for distribution of Excellagen through both our proprietary market channels, and through our national distribution footprint.
 Manufacturing 
 Generex Historical Business

NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology (formerly Antigen Express) Manufacturing
 NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology manufactures AE37 immunotherapeutic vaccine, a nineteen amino-acid peptide referred to as AE37 (Ii-Key/HER2 776-790 hybrid) under contract with PolyPeptide Laboratories, San Diego, CA. The suspended substance (lypophilized peptide suspended in sterile, normal saline) is formulated into 2 mL glass vials containing 500 micrograms of peptide in 0.5 mL of 0.45% saline. All manufacturing of AE37 is conducted under FDA cGMP compliance.

31
--

 

We have produced, packaged and shipped AE37 for the upcoming clinical trial of AE37 in combination with pembrolizumab (Merck’s Keytruda) for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer.
 
The Company will require additional manufacturing for future trials with AE37 or any other Ii-Key hybrid immunotherapeutic peptide for the treatment of cancer, and plans to use PolyPeptide Laboratories for future production work. In the event that PolyPeptide Laboratories is unable to meet the manufacturing requirements of NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, there are multiple contract manufacturers that can provide cGMP peptide synthesis, purification, and packaging services.
 
NGDx Diagnostic Manufacturing
NGDx manufactures it RTD devices in our Miramar, Florida facility. Based on order size, delivery requirements and current orders in process, the Miramar facility can manufacture up to 1 million RTD devices, all of which are currently hand assembled. We have long-standing relationships with subcontractors to handle additional production requirements. 
 
Cassette production is conducted through subcontractors in India and China. Each site operates under GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) as well as being compliant with ISO 9001 and ISO13485. All HDS cassettes are included in our U.S. Certificate of Exportability and European Union CE Mark registrations. All of our cassette malaria tests are approved by the WHO.
 
We have established Quality and Assembly Agreements as well as confidentiality agreements with our subcontractors. All are subject to our inspection at a moment’s notice.
 
The quality of final assembly of each of our products is maintained under the strict guidelines of our internal Quality System, which forms the basis for our ISO13485 rating. 
 
Full quality oversight is mandatory and final batch release testing is conducted on each lot of products assembled prior to shipment release. 
 
With full automation, we anticipate producing up to 10 million EXPRESS devices annually. Expanded production would allow for additional expansion beyond this volume. Additionally, it is anticipated that subcontractors would provide approximately 60 million cassette tests per year.

 Olaregen contracts with a third-party specialty manufacturer in the United Kingdom to manufacture Excellagen. Excellagen is an aseptically manufactured, flowable dermal matrix consisting of a stabilized formulation of renatured atelopeptide bovine fibrillar tropocollagen supplied in prefilled, ready to use syringes. Excellagen is manufactured according to Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and requires controlled temperature storage (2-8°C) to maintain structural integrity and bioactivity.
 
During manufacture, the collagen component of Excellagen is purified using a specialized, validated aseptic process that effectively inactivates potential contaminating viruses, eliminates impurities, and removes denatured molecules and collagen fragments. Excellagen consists almost exclusively of high molecular weight, intact, fibrillar collagen and is formulated at a concentration of 2.6% (26 mg/mL) in a physiologic buffer with protein stabilizing agents.

Regentys Manufacturing
 Regentys has contracted with Cook Biotech Incorporated (CBI), West Layette, IN on the development and manufacture of the Regentys ECMH™ (Extracellular Matrix Hydrogel) Rectal Solution, an extracellular matrix hydrogel derived from small intestinal submucosa (SIS) of pigs. All manufacturing is conducted according to FDA cGMP standards.
Pantheon Medical Manufacturing
 Pantheon manufacturers foot & ankle surgical kits including plates and screws under contract with a third-party contract manufacturer. The FDA has granted 510(k) clearance (“510(k) Approval”) to the Pantheon plates and screws, authorizing Pantheon to commercially distribute the foot & ankle surgical kit. The 510(k) Approval process, also known as pre-market notification, requires demonstrating that the new medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally U.S. marketed medical device. Once a device receives a 510(k) Approval, maintaining that status is based on compliance with annual requirements set by the FDA. All manufacturing is conducted under FDA GMP compliance.
RAW MATERIAL SUPPLIES 
 Generex Historical Business Raw Materials 
 The excipients used in our formulation are available from numerous sources in sufficient quantities for clinical purposes, and we believe that they will be available in sufficient quantities for commercial purposes when required, although we have not yet attempted to secure a guaranteed commercial supply of any such products. Components suitable for our RapidMist™ brand metered dose inhaler are available from a limited number of potential suppliers, as is the chemical propellant used in the device. The components which now comprise the device are expected to be used in the commercial version of our insulin product in countries where the product has been approved. We do not currently have supply arrangements for commercial quantities with manufacturers for the components and the propellant that we presently use in our RapidMist™ brand metered dose. Reputable and reliable suppliers for these components exist and we believe that we can enter into arrangements for commercial supply with these suppliers when we are ready to commence commercial production.
 
Insulin is available worldwide from multiple sources. We do not currently have any agreements for the long-term supply of insulin, but we expect that we will be readily able to negotiate such an agreement before further clinical trials or commercial sales commence.
 
AE37 and other Ii-Key hybrid immunotherapeutic peptides are produced via standard peptide synthesis and purification methods requiring readily available amino acids and standard chemicals.
 
NuGenerex Diagnostics Raw Materials 
 A number of our components and critical raw materials are provided by third-party suppliers. Some of our supplies, including antigens and antibodies may be available from only one or a limited number of sources. This may impact our ability to manufacture or sell product if our suppliers cannot or will not deliver those materials in a timely fashion, or at all, due to an interruption in their supply, quality or technical issues, or any other reason. The absence of any one or more of these supplies could prevent us from being able to commercially produce and market the affected product or products.

Immunotherapy Intellectual Property Portfolio
 Platform Patents
 The foundational “Platform Patents” for Ii-Key technology focus on methods of increasing the antigen-specific activation of CD4+ T cells. This cell type is a critical component of the immune system, involved both in the recognition of new pathogenic agents as well as in autoimmune syndromes. The first technology platform (Ii-Key hybrid) relates to a means for increasing the vaccine potency of virtually any protein and while the second (Ii-suppression) relates to generation of an effective cell-based vaccine (REH-2007, REH-2014, REH-2015, REH-2017).
Oncology Patents
 This group of patents relate more specifically to the use of the platform technologies for generating anti-cancer vaccines. We have generated Ii-Key hybrid compounds specifically for patients with breast, prostate, bladder, melanoma and HPV-related cancers (AEX-2001, AEX-2006, AEX-2007, REH-2005).
 
NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology holds 9 U.S. patents and 1 worldwide patent covering:
 

• | Compositions and Methods Related to Ii Technology 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ii hybrid peptides used for the enhancement of antigen presentation 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Constructs for the expression of Ii-Key/antigen epitope fusion peptides 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hybrid Ii-Key/antigen epitope fusion peptides 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Methods for inhibiting Ii expression 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Although some U.S. patents on the Ii-Key technology have expired, we are in discussions with third parties to extend the patent coverage of the Ii-Key technology for cancer immunotherapy. The expiration dates of the immune-oncology applications of the Ii-Key hybrid technologies extend to 2031.
 
Our long-term success will substantially depend upon our ability to obtain patent protection for our technology and our ability to protect our technology from infringement, misappropriation, discovery and duplication. We cannot be sure that any of our pending patent applications will be granted, or that any patents which we own or obtain in the future will fully protect our position. Our patent rights and the patent rights of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in general, are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues. We believe that our existing technology and the patents which we hold or for which we have applied do not infringe anyone else's patent rights. We believe our patent rights will provide meaningful protection against others duplicating our proprietary technologies. We cannot be sure of this, however, because of the complexity of the legal and scientific issues that could arise in litigation over these issues.
 
We also rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information. We seek to protect this information, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators.

On June 2018, we filed for patent protection for the Express II format with the US Patent and Trademark Office. This patent is still pending.
 
We believe NGDx’s long-term success will substantially depend upon our ability to obtain patent protection for our technology and our ability to protect our technology from infringement, misappropriation, discovery and duplication. We cannot be sure that any future patents will be granted, or that any patents which we now own or obtain in the future will fully protect our position. Our patent rights and the patent rights of medical device companies in general, are uncertain and con include complex legal and factual issues. We believe that our existing technology and the patents which we hold or for which we have applied do not infringe anyone else's patent rights. We believe our patent rights will provide meaningful protection against others duplicating our proprietary technologies. We cannot be sure of this, however, because of the complexity of the legal and scientific issues that could arise in litigation over these issues.

Seasonality
 
The products and services provided by the organization are not subject to seasonality.
 Competition 
 Generex Historical Business Competition
         We expect that products based upon our buccal delivery technology and any other products that we may develop will compete directly with products developed by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, government agencies and public and private research organizations.
 
Products developed by our competitors may use a different active pharmaceutical agent or treatment to treat the same medical condition or indication as our product or may provide for the delivery of substantially the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as our products using different methods of administration. For example, a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are engaged in various stages of research, development and testing of alternatives to insulin therapy for the treatment of diabetes, as well as new methods of delivering insulin. These methods, including nasal, transdermal, needle-free (high pressure) injection and pulmonary, may ultimately successfully deliver insulin to diabetic patients. Some biotechnology companies also have developed different technologies to enhance the presentation of peptide antigens. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific research and product development capabilities, as well as financial, marketing and human resources, than we do.
 
Where the same or substantially the same active ingredient is available using alternative delivery means or the same or substantially the same result is achievable with a different treatment or technology, we expect that competition among products will be based, among other things, on product safety, efficacy, ease of use, availability, price, marketing and distribution. When different active pharmaceutical ingredients are involved, these same competitive factors will apply to both the active agent and the delivery method.
 
We consider other drug delivery and biotechnology companies to be direct competitors for the cooperation and support of major drug and biotechnology companies that own or market proprietary pharmaceutical compounds and technologies, as well as for the ultimate patient market. Of primary concern to us are the competitor companies that are known to be developing delivery systems for insulin and other pharmaceutical agents that we have identified as product candidates and technologies to enhance the presentation of peptide antigens.
 
Large pharmaceutical companies, such as Merck & Co., Inc., GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Novartis, Inc., MedImmune Inc. (a subsidiary of Astra-Zeneca, Inc.) and others, also compete in the oncology, immunomedicine and vaccine markets. These companies have greater experience and expertise in securing government contracts and grants to support research and development efforts, conducting testing and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals to market products, as well as manufacturing and marketing approved products. As such, they are also considered significant competitors in these fields of pharmaceutical products and therapies. There are also many smaller companies which are pursuing similar technologies in these fields and are considered to be our competitors.
 
There are also a number of companies developing alternative means of delivering insulin in the form of oral pills, transdermal patches, and intranasal methods, which are at early stages of development. In addition to other delivery systems for insulin, there are numerous products, such as sulfonylureas (Amaryl® and Glynase®), biguanides (branded and generic metformin products), thiazolidinediones (Avandia® and Actos®), glucagon-like peptide 1 (Byetta® and Victoza®), and dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors (Januvia® and Onglyza™), which have been approved for use in the treatment of Type 2 diabetics in substitution of, or in addition to, insulin therapy. These products may also be considered to compete with insulin products.

In addition, there are a number of companies which are pursuing cancer treatments using immunotherapy technologies which have products in various clinical trial stages.  Some of these companies are Argos Therapeutics Inc., Celldex Therapeutics Inc., Northwest Therapeutics Inc., Immatics Biotechnology GmbH, Immunocellular Therapeutics Ltd., TVAX Biomedical Inc. and Newlink Genetics Corporation.  These companies can also be considered to be competitors.
 
NuGenerex Diagnostics Competition
         The diagnostics industry is a multi-billion dollar international industry and is intensely competitive.  Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial, research, manufacturing and marketing resources.  Industry competition in general is based on the following:

• | Scientific and technological Capability; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proprietary know-how and intellectual protection; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ability to develop and market products and processes; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ability to obtain FDA or other regulatory clearances; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ability to manufacture products that meet applicable governmental and NGO requirements; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ability to manufacture products cost-effectively; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Access to adequate capital; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ability to find and retain qualified personnel. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe our scientific and technological capabilities as well as our proprietary technology and know-how relating to our rapid tests, particularly for the development and manufacture of tests for the detection of antibodies to infectious diseases are, indeed, very strong and will allow us to compete in this market.
 
Main Competitors

In the diagnostic space, Alere Inc., which was acquired by Abbott Laboratories in 2017, is our main competitor and one of the major players in RTDs for infectious diseases. Standard Diagnostics is a strong competitor on an international basis, incorporating a cassette design into each of their products. Our competitors also include Chembio Diagnostic Systems Inc., a publicly traded diagnostic company that develops, manufactures and commercializes diagnostic solutions. There are a number of point-of-care strip manufacturers in China which serve the market in that country. As of yet most of these companies have not made a significant impact on the overall global market but could be considered as a future source of competition. As infectious diseases are epidemic and in the minds of the public, there will be more competitors coming into the marketplace. However, competition will be based upon the implementation of a cassette or a “dipstick” format. 
Competitive Advantage
         We believe our unique and simple EXPRESS product design delivers significant advantages over our competition. 
 
Due to the potential infectious character of the whole blood test sample, our EXPRESS series of RDTs are designed to perform and deliver test results while sealed within the EXPRESS housing, carefully controlling the potentially infectious test sample. This design helps to increase our ability to control the possibility of cross-contamination. Most of our competitors’ products, while inexpensive, are not as user-friendly, require substantially more training and have greater risk of cross- contamination. And, the simplicity of use of our EXPRESS platforms fits directly into the necessities of World Health Organization Rapid Disease Testing Algorithms and individual country disease reduction goals and priorities.

38
--

 

Our products are more intuitive and self-explanatory than our competitors making it easier and safer to use. Our products require less training and education. Each EXPRESS is configured to operate in the same way regardless of the type of disease being tested.
 
With ease of use, simple design and faster results, our products allow for more tests administered at the patient point of care level.
 
We will compete on the basis these advantages. Most of our competitors’ products, while inexpensive, are not as user-friendly, require substantially more training and have greater risk of cross- contamination.
 
NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology Competition
 The cancer immunotherapy space is crowded as the scientific mechanisms of cancer and immunity become better understood. According to the Cancer Research Institute, there are 3,394 immuno-oncology therapies in the current global development pipeline, with 1,287 of them in clinical studies. The major pharmaceutical companies, including Novartis, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Sanofi, and Pfizer, among others have significant research and development efforts in the immune-oncology field.
 
Neon Therapeutics is a leading immune-oncology biotechnology company. TapImmune and Marker Therapeutics recently merged to advance innovative neoantigen and immunotherapy products.
 
NuGenerex Surgical Products Competition
 As a national distributor, we primarily compete with other distributors, as well as large, vertically-integrated medical device manufacturers that enjoy well-established distribution channels, national sales networks, direct sales models, and participation in large group purchasing organizations contracted with major hospitals and surgery centers.
 
We believe that our status as the manufacturer and distributor of FDA-approved Maxim X-Treme System, sets us apart from other distributors and gives us a competitive advantage against distributors who are not able to manufacture their own products.
 
Generally, we view Stryker Corporation, Smith & Nephew, and Orthofix International, N.V., as examples of our vertically-integrated competitors. We believe those competitors, and companies like them, only distribute products they manufacture and have significant costs related to research and development and organizational support. Conversely, we sell a broad portfolio of specialized third-party manufacturers’ products and have no costs related to research and development for such third-party products, nor do we have similar costs for organizational support since we are not vertically-integrated. Thus, we believe our competitive advantage lies primarily with our single-source fulfillment sales model, allowing us to offer a broader assortment of several manufacturers’ products. Furthermore, as a manufacturer for some medical devices, we do not have significant costs associated with research and development or organizational support. Thus, we generally see immediate increases in revenues because of the increased gross margins afforded by the lower costs associated with being a manufacturer. Accordingly, the compensation packages we offer to our employed sales team have higher-earning potentials than the compensation packages our competitors offer, allowing us to attract and retain talented and experienced employees.
 
We contract primarily with small- and medium-sized manufacturers of Orthopedic Implants that are subject to FDA compliance and approval standards. These manufacturers are highly innovative and cost effective because of their streamlined sales infrastructures. Because of our organizational structure, large distribution footprint, and our sales model, we tend to align well with our specialized suppliers’ competitive strategies, which we believe results in more partnerships with such suppliers than our competitors, because we can purchase large quantities of their product as a wholesale customer.
 

39
--

 

We believe the competition in our industry is primarily caused by continued mergers and acquisitions of smaller distributors by larger, vertically-integrated companies that produce, market and distribute medical devices, Orthopedic Implants, and Biologics. Our vertically-integrated competitors benefit from their ability to control costs for the devices they manufacture and distribute. Moreover, the market in which we operate is sensitive to changes in third-party and government reimbursements and, to a lesser degree, competitive discount pricing. We believe that our industry will continue to see increased mergers and acquisitions because the market is significantly fragmented with numerous medical device distributors and specialized suppliers offering similar product portfolios throughout the United States.
 
Environmental Compliance
 Our research and development activities have involved the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We believe that our procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with all applicable government regulations. However, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. If an accident occurred, we could be held liable for damages, and these damages could severely impact our financial condition. We are also subject to many environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, particularly those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens, and the handling of hazardous biological materials. Violations and the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could adversely affect us. However, we do not believe that compliance with applicable environmental laws will have a material effect on us in the foreseeable future.
Research and Development Expenditures 
 NuGenerex Diagnostics Research & Development Expenditures
 A substantial portion of our activities to date have been in research and development. Generex expended $381,030 in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 and $315,318 in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 on research and development related to its buccal delivery products and Antigen’s immunotherapy products.
 
NGDx research and development expenditures were $598,000 in the 12 months ended July 31, 2019 and $524,000 in the 12 months ended July 31, 2018. NGDx research and development is primarily related to development of the EXPRESS II and testing of existing products for stability and accuracy and development of new test parameters.
 
NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology (formerly Antigen Express) Research & Development Expenditures

NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology is engaged in a clinical trial to evaluate the use of AE37 immunotherapeutic peptide vaccine in combination with pembrolizumab (Merck’s Keytruda) for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer. We have expended roughly $450,000 to date to finance the trial, including the cost of clinical supplies and packaging. The trial will require additional funding estimated at roughly $1.5 million over the next three years.
 
Regentys research and development expenditures were $770,000 from January 8, 2019 through July 31, 2019.
 Employees
 The Generex management team has been working without contracts or employment agreements since taking over the Company in January 2017. Upon financing, we expect to engage the management team as employees with terms to be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Generex Board of Directors.
