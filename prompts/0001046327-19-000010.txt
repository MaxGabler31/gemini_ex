Item 1. | Business

Overview
RealNetworks creates innovative technology products and services that make it easy to connect with and enjoy digital media. We invented the streaming media category in 1995 and continue to connect consumers with their digital media both directly and through partners, aiming to support every network, device, media type and social network. We provide our digital media products and services to consumers, mobile carriers, device manufacturers and other businesses.
Consumers use our digital media products and services to store, organize, play, manage and enjoy their digital media content, either directly from us or through our distribution partners. Our consumer products and services include our casual games, our ringback tone and messaging tools, and RealPlayer, our widely distributed media player. Our video compression technology is licensed primarily to OEMs, including manufacturers of mobile devices, smart TVs, and set-top boxes. The monetization, distribution, and licensing of our technology products and services are heavily dependent on contracts with third parties, such as mobile carriers and device manufacturers. 
We were incorporated in 1994 in the State of Washington. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol “RNWK.”
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("10-K") for the year ended December 31, 2018, RealNetworks, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is referred to as “RealNetworks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our.” “RealPlayer,” “RealMedia,” and other trademarks of ours appearing in this report are our property.
Segments
We report revenue and operating income (loss) in three segments: (1) Consumer Media, (2) Mobile Services, and (3) Games. We allocate to our reportable segments certain corporate expenses which are directly attributable to supporting the business, including but not limited to a portion of finance, IT, legal, human resources and headquarters facilities. Remaining expenses, which are not directly attributable to supporting the business, are reported as corporate items. Also reported in our corporate segment are restructuring charges, lease exit and related charges, and stock compensation charges. 
Consumer Media
In our Consumer Media segment, revenue is primarily derived from the licensing of our portfolio of video codecs. Codecs are an encoding and decoding technology which are designed to reduce the amount of bits required to stream or store media content, and modern codecs achieve significant savings in streaming bandwidth and storage costs. Our latest codec technology, RealMedia High Definition, which we refer to as RealMedia HD or RMHD, offers significant compression advantages over our prior-generation codec, RealMedia Variable Bitrate, or RMVB, which is still widely used. Our codec technologies business is primarily focused in the Chinese market, where RMVB is a popular format and also where we continue to focus most of our efforts to date regarding RMHD. 
We continue to develop and innovate our codec technology to meet or exceed user demands for increasing compression efficiency and visual quality. We license our codec technology to a variety of electronic equipment, microchip, and integrated circuit manufacturers who embed our codec in their products, including mobile devices, laptops, smart TVs and other devices. To ensure a robust ecosystem for our codec technologies, we also promote the use of our codec technology to producers of media content and users of RealPlayer, thus encouraging the widespread adoption by device manufacturers.
We also generate revenue through online sales to consumers of our PC-based RealPlayer subscription products, including our SuperPass service, which provides consumers with access to digital entertainment content for a monthly fee. The RealPlayer media player, our enduring yet continually evolving software product, includes features and services that enable consumers to discover, play, download, manage and edit digital video, stream audio and video, download and save photos and videos from the web, transfer and share content on social networks, and edit their own photo and video content. As part of our RealPlayer download process, we also offer distribution of third-party software products to consumers, which generates additional revenue.
Mobile Services
Mobile Services consists of the various digital media services we provide to mobile and online service providers as software as a service (SaaS) offerings. Included in our SaaS offerings are our messaging products, which include our intercarrier messaging service, Kontxt (our text message management, anti-spam, and classification product), and our ringback tone service. We provide these services to a large number of mobile carriers around the world, although a significant portion of our revenue for this segment results from contracts with a few mobile carriers and one service partner. Also included in this segment are our recently introduced facial recognition and our RealTimes platforms. Our facial recognition platform, SAFR (Secure Accurate Facial Recognition), detects and matches millions of faces by leveraging artificial intelligence-based machine

learning. We offer our RealTimes platform to mobile carriers for incorporation in their hosted cloud solutions. We also offer business intelligence, subscriber management and billing for the carriers who make our offerings available to their customers. 
Our intercarrier messaging platform enables operators to send and receive SMS messages worldwide between networks and service providers, regardless of network technology, typically processing billions of SMS messages per day between users on hundreds of different networks. We earn revenue from our intercarrier messaging service based on a revenue-sharing arrangement with one service partner. Our next-generation mobile messaging platform, Kontxt, evaluates message streams sent from an application to a person (A2P) and classifies those messages into various categories. This allows network operators and other service providers to create policies for prioritization and delivery of messages and blocking spam and fraudulent messages, resulting in more efficient text message delivery. 
Our ringback tone services enable callers to hear subscriber-selected music or messages instead of the traditional electronic ringing sound while waiting for the person they have called to answer. We primarily offer ringback tone services via mobile carriers, where, in return for providing, operating and managing the ringback tone service for the carrier customers, we generally enter into revenue-sharing arrangements with the carriers based on monthly subscription fees, content download fees or a combination of such fees paid by subscribers. 
Our photo and video sharing platform, RealTimes, is offered to wireless carriers for integration in their hosted cloud solutions. Within our Mobile Services group, we focus on leveraging current and prospective wireless carrier relationships to increase integration of the RealTimes platform.
As disclosed in our 2017 10-K, in December 2017, we exited our low-margin music on demand service in Korea. As the profits generated from this business had significantly declined over time, we did not seek renewal of the sole contract for this service. Accordingly, this business is reported as discontinued operations in our financial statements for the periods disclosed in this 10-K.
Games
Our Games segment is focused on the development, publishing, and distribution of casual games, which are offered via mobile devices, digital downloads, and subscription play. Casual games typically have simple graphics, rules and controls, are quick to learn, and often include time-management, board, card, puzzle, word and hidden-object games. In the mobile market, we are focused on creating a large and diverse portfolio of products that combine casual game play and storytelling. We call this product line GameHouse Original Stories (Original Stories). Our Original Stories are based on a series of characters including Emily (Delicious Franchise), Amanda (Heart's Medicine) and Angela (Fabulous). The portfolio continues to grow as new characters and story lines are developed. Original Stories are primarily developed by our in-house game studios or through partnerships with external game developers for both mobile and PC play. Also offered to our customers are games licensed to us by third parties.
Our mobile games are digitally distributed through third-party application storefronts, such as the Apple App Store and Google Play, and are principally offered in North America, Europe and Latin America. As they are released, new games are typically introduced to consumers through offering a free trial before purchase on an individual basis. After reaching a certain level in game play, consumers then have the option to purchase the full game. In addition to the sale of mobile games, we also generate revenue from player purchases of in-game virtual goods and through advertising shown to consumers during play. 
PC consumers can access and play both our Original Stories and hundreds of third party games through individual purchases or a subscription service offered through our GameHouse and Zylom websites, and through websites owned or managed by third parties. Consistent with our mobile offerings, we typically introduce new games by offering a free trial before purchase on an individual basis or as part of one of our subscription services. 
See Note 20. Segment Information, in this 10-K for additional details on our segments and geographic concentrations.
Napster (formerly branded as Rhapsody)
At December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 42% of the issued and outstanding stock of Napster. Since the Rhapsody streaming music service has been re-branded as Napster, all references to Napster in this 10-K refer to Rhapsody International, Inc., d/b/a Napster. See Note 5. Napster Joint Venture, in this 10-K for additional details. As described in more detail in Note 22. Subsequent Event, on January 18, 2019 RealNetworks acquired an additional 42% stake in Napster from its former joint venture partner.
Napster provides music products and services that enable consumers to have access to digital music content from a variety of devices. The Napster unlimited subscription service offers unlimited access to a catalog of tens of millions of music tracks by way of on-demand streaming and conditional downloads. Napster also operates a radio-like service, branded as "UnRadio" in the U.S., through which users can listen to online radio stations based on selected artists or genres and download favorite tracks played on those stations for offline playback. Napster currently offers music services worldwide (under the 
5

Napster brand) and generates revenue primarily through subscriptions to its music services either directly to consumers or through distribution partners, such as mobile carriers.
Customers 
Our customers include consumers and businesses located throughout the world. Sales to customers outside the U.S., primarily in Europe and Asia, were 48%, 48% and 49% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Note 20. Segment Information, for details on geographic concentrations and see Note 7. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable and Sales Returns, for details on customer revenue concentrations.
Research and Development
We devote a substantial portion of our resources to developing new products, enhancing existing products, expanding and improving our fundamental technology, and strengthening our technological expertise in all our businesses. 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Our marketing programs are aimed at increasing brand awareness of our products and services and stimulating demand. We use a variety of methods to market our products and services, including paid search advertising, affiliate marketing programs, electronic and other online media, and email offers to qualified potential and existing customers, and providing product specific information through our websites. We also cross-market products and services offered by some of our businesses through the RealPlayer and Games marketing and distribution channels. We have subsidiaries and offices in several countries that market and sell our products outside the U.S.
Our products and services are marketed through direct and indirect channels. We use public relations, trade shows, events and speaking opportunities to market our products and services. We also use a variety of online channels, including social media, to promote and sell our products and services directly.
In our Consumer Media business, we market and sell our various RealPlayer services directly through our own websites such as Real.com, as well as indirectly through third party distribution partners. We also employ a sales team in China which works with distribution partners on marketing of our codec technologies. 
Our Mobile Services sales, marketing and business development team works closely with many of our enterprise, infrastructure, wireless, broadband and media customers to identify new business opportunities for our entertainment applications, services and systems. Through ongoing communications with the product and marketing divisions of our customers, we tailor our SaaS offerings to their strategic needs and the needs of their subscribers. 
Our games are marketed directly from our GameHouse and Zylom websites and through third-party distribution channels, such as application storefronts, search engines, online portals, and content publishers.
Customer Support
Customer support is integral to the provision of nearly all of our consumer products and services. Consumers who purchase and use our consumer software products and services can get assistance primarily via the Internet or email, depending on the product or service. For most of our consumer products, we contract with third-party outsource support vendors to provide the primary staffing for our first-tier customer support globally. We also provide various support service options for our business customers and for software developers using our software products and associated services. Support service options include online support services and on-site support personnel covering technical and business-related support topics.
Competition
The market for software and services for digital media delivery over the Internet and wireless networks is intensely competitive. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition or brand awareness, more employees or significantly greater resources than we do.
In our Consumer Media segment, our codec technology faces competition from other next-generation video codecs, and many of our competitors have come together in patent pools to market and license competing codecs. In order to be successful, we must withstand the inherent market penetration that arises when multiple companies promote a shared codec solution. Our RealPlayer media player also continues to face competition from alternative streaming media playback applications which have obtained very broad market penetration. 
In our Mobile Services segment, our SaaS business competes with a large and diverse number of domestic and international companies, and each of our SaaS offerings tends to face competitors specific to that product or service. Our SaaS business continues to experience significant competitive pricing pressure from carriers and the proliferation of smartphone applications and services, some of which do not depend on our carrier customers for distribution to consumers. Many of our SaaS services require a high degree of integration with carrier or service provider networks and thus require a high degree of 
6

operational expertise. In addition, our ability to enhance services with new features as the digital entertainment market evolves is critical to our competitive position, as is our knowledge of the consumer environment to which these services are targeted.
Our Games business competes with a variety of distributors and publishers of casual games for PC and mobile platforms. Our in-house game development studios compete with other developers and publishers of mobile games based on our ability to create high quality games that resonate with consumers, and our ability to secure broad distribution. 
Intellectual Property
As of December 31, 2018, we had 19 U.S. patents, 27 patents in other countries and more than 55 pending patent applications worldwide relating to various aspects of our technology. We regularly analyze our patent portfolio and prepare additional patent applications on current and anticipated features of our technology in various jurisdictions across the world, or sell or abandon patents or applications that are no longer relevant or valuable to our operations.
In addition to our patent portfolio, we have assembled, over time, an international portfolio of trademarks and service marks that covers certain of our products and services. We also have applications pending for additional trademarks and service marks in jurisdictions around the world, and have several unregistered trademarks. Many of our marks begin with the word “Real” (such as RealPlayer). We are aware of other companies that use “Real” in their marks alone or in combination with other words, and we do not expect to be able to prevent all third-party uses of the word “Real” for all goods and services.
Our ability to compete across our businesses partly depends on the superiority, uniqueness and value of the technology that we both develop and license from third parties. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. These efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our technology, or may not prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with those we develop.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 441 employees, of which 129 were based in the Americas, 107 were based in Asia, and 205 were based in Europe. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. 
Position on Charitable Responsibility
In periods when we have achieved sustained profitability, we intend to donate 5% of our net income to charitable organizations, which will reduce our net income for those periods. The non-profit RealNetworks Foundation, established in 2001, manages a substantial portion of our charitable giving efforts. Through the Foundation, we support our employees' philanthropic efforts by matching their donations of time and money to charitable organizations.

We make available free of charge on www.investor.realnetworks.com our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
