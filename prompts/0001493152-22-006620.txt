Item 1. Business.
 
Business Introduction/Summary
 
References herein to “we,” “us,” “Sunworks,” and “the Company” are to Sunworks, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Sunworks United Inc. (“Sunworks United”), and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Solcius, LLC (“Solcius”) and Commercial Solar Energy Inc. (“CSE”).
 
We provide photovoltaic (“PV”) and battery based power and storage systems for the residential and commercial markets. Commercial projects include commercial, agricultural, industrial and public works projects.
 
We were originally incorporated in Delaware on January 30, 2002 as MachineTalker, Inc. In July 2010, we changed our company name to Solar3D, Inc. On January 31, 2014, we acquired 100% of the stock of Solar United Network, Inc., a California corporation. On March 2, 2015, we acquired MD Energy. On December 1, 2015, we acquired Plan B through a merger of Plan B Enterprises, Inc. into our wholly owned subsidiary, Elite Solar Acquisition Sub., Inc. On March 1, 2016 we changed our name to Sunworks, Inc. with simultaneous Nasdaq stock symbol change from SLTD to SUNW.
 
On April 8, 2021, Sunworks, Inc., through its operating subsidiary Sunworks United (the “Buyer”), acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests (the “Acquisition”) of Solcius, from Solcius Holdings, LLC (“Seller”). Located in Provo, Utah, Solcius is a full-service, residential solar systems provider. The transaction creates a national solar power provider with a presence now in 15 states, including California, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and South Carolina. The Company believes the transaction enhances economies of scale, leading to better access to suppliers, vendors and financial partners, as well as marketing and customer acquisition opportunities.
 
The Acquisition was consummated on April 8, 2021 pursuant to a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 8, 2021 (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and between Buyer and Seller. The purchase price for Solcius consisted of $51.75 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments related to working capital, cash, indebtedness and transaction expenses.
 
Sunworks
 
Through our Sunworks operating subsidiaries, we design, arrange financing, integrate, install, and manage systems ranging in size from 2kW (kilowatt) for residential projects to multi-MW (megawatt) systems for larger commercial and public works projects. Commercial installations have included installations at office buildings, manufacturing plants, warehouses, service stations, churches, and agricultural facilities such as farms, wineries, and dairies. Public works installations have included school districts, local municipalities, federal facilities and higher education institutions. Commercial solar represented 23% of our 2021 revenue, compared to 74% of our revenue in 2020. Commercial Solar primarily operates primarily in California. 
Solcius
 
Through our Solcius operating subsidiary, we design, arrange financing, integrate, install, and manage systems, primarily for residential homeowners. We sell residential solar systems through multiple channels, including our network of sales channel partners, and our growing direct sales channel strategy. We operate in several residential and commercial markets including California, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota, Wisconsin and South Carolina. We have direct sales or operations personnel in California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, South Carolina, Wisconsin and Minnesota.

Company Strategy
 
We intend to capitalize on the growth outlook for commercial and residential solar markets in North America. Our strategic objectives include the following, of which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are, and potentially will be, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and its related effects and any negative economic downturn:

○ | Capitalize on industry growth. Over the last decade, solar power has become the lowest cost new energy generation source as the industry matured and as technology has evolved. With solar, both residential and commercial customers can realize short pay back periods and can reduce their exposure to traditional energy sources. Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) considerations are factored into customer buying patterns, as consumers want less reliance on grid participation and focus on renewable forms of energy generation. Additionally, the regulatory environment is generally positive, as the Biden administration continues to pursue incentives directed to clean energy generation. As a result, the solar industry is expected to grow at a rapid rate and become a significant source of new power generation, displacing some carbon-based alternatives.

○ | Leverage Solcius acquisition to expand into new geographies. Solcius has operations within 10 states and has plans to grow in new markets, where solar power is becoming more prevalent or is underserved. The Solcius acquisition has not only provided platforms of growth within the residential market, but also within our commercial business. It is our plan to leverage the Solcius footprint to expand our commercial operations over time. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | Pursue acquisitions to build scale. We intend to pursue acquisitions that develop scale, expand our geographic reach, increase our product offerings or improve our customer acquisition costs. We view scale as important in the solar industry, as larger competitors can leverage technology and supply chain economies of scale; reducing costs to consumers and improving the company’s cash flow generation. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | Expand multi-channel sales network. In our residential business in 2021, relationships with authorized dealers were the primary lead generation source. We intend to grow our authorized dealers and sales channel partner network in the future, by leveraging our IT platforms and history of providing best in class installation services. Additionally, we are developing internal methods of acquiring customers through in-house sales and tele-sales in markets where we do not have a significant presence today. We expect a sale to installation offering will allow us to expand our services and product offerings and reduce our customer acquisition costs over time. Our view is that both internal and external channels allow for an effective, scalable and cost-efficient growth.

Company Operations
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 511 employees of which 495 were full-time employees with 16 of those employees on temporary layoff, medical, family or disability leave. We also utilize outside subcontractors to assist with installing commercial solar systems for our commercial customers. Our direct installation labor is a combination of employees and contract labor.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 122 full-time employees with 38 of those employees on temporary layoff, medical, family or disability leave plus two part-time employees.

Sales and Marketing
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 35 employees primarily focused on sales, sales support and marketing.
 
We are adding to our in-house direct residential sales force and marketing capabilities while we continue to partner with authorized dealers and select third-party sales originators. Reducing our residential customer acquisition costs and managing the customer experience throughout the process of sales and installation is part of our goal to minimize the fixed costs and financial risk of customer acquisition while improving the entire customer experience.
 
We have an advantage in the commercial solar market given our extensive contact list, resulting from our experience in the construction market, which provides access to customers. Through our network of vendors, participation in a variety of industry trade associations and independent sales consultants, we now have a growing list of repeat clients, as well as an active and loyal referral network.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 16 employees primarily focused on sales, sales support and marketing.
 
Financing
 
To promote sales, we assist customers in obtaining financing through our network of lenders that offer leases, loans or Power Purchase Agreements (“PPAs”). A PPA is a contract between two parties, one which generates electricity and the other purchases the electricity.
Suppliers
 
We purchase solar panels, inverters, batteries and materials from multiple manufacturers both directly and through distributors. We intend to further coordinate purchases and optimize supply relationships to realize advantages of greater scale. Section 201 tariffs on solar modules were imposed beginning in 2018 and were extended through 2026. While these tariffs have not had a material negative impact on our business, we believe the tariffs were a contributing factor to smaller decreases to equipment costs than we would have otherwise experienced in 2021.


If one or more of our suppliers fail to meet our anticipated demand, ceases or reduces production due to its financial condition, acquisition by a competitor or otherwise, it may be difficult to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative products on commercially reasonable terms, and our ability to satisfy this demand may be adversely affected. We do not, however, rely on any single supplier and, we believe, we can obtain needed solar panels and materials from a variety of different suppliers. Accordingly, we believe that the loss of any single supplier would not materially affect our business.
 
We also utilize strategic partnerships with subcontractors for carport construction, and electrical installations, for racking and solar panel installations, as well as subcontractors for roofing, grading, landscaping, and construction for our larger commercial projects.
 
Installation
 
We are a licensed contractor in the markets we serve, and we are responsible for every customer installation. We manage the entire process from permitting through inspection to interconnection to the power grid, thereby making the system installation process simpler and as seamless as possible for our customers. Controlling every aspect of the installation process allows us to minimize costs, ensure quality and deliver high levels of customer satisfaction.

Even with controlling every aspect of the installation process, the ability to perform on a contract is subject to limitations. Jurisdictional approval processes are outside of our immediate control including, but not limited to, approval processes required by cities, counties, states or the federal government or one of their agencies. Other aspects outside of our direct control include approvals from various utility companies and weather conditions.
 
After-Sales Support
 
We offer continuing operational and maintenance services for our installed residential and commercial PV systems by providing extended factory equipment technical support and acting as a service liaison using our proprietary knowledge, technology, and solar electric energy and battery system qualified engineering and technical staff. We do this through a Limited Workmanship Warranty and Operations and Maintenance Program, which among other things provides a service and technical support line to our customers. We generally respond to our job site related issues within 24 hours. We strive to offer assistance for residential installations as long as required to maintain customer satisfaction. For commercial customers we offer separate operation, maintenance and monitoring contracts. These operation, maintenance and monitoring contracts generally have terms ranging from 5 to 25 years.


Facilities
 
We maintain sales and installation offices in Roseville, Sacramento, Tulare, Tustin and Riverside, California. We also maintain sales and installation offices in Provo, Utah; Phoenix, Arizona; Centennial, Colorado; El Paso and McAllen, Texas; Albuquerque and Roswell, New Mexico; Bloomingdale, Minnesota; Columbia, South Carolina; and Sturtevant, Wisconsin. We lease all of our offices and facilities.
Customers
 
Approximately 77% of our 2021 revenue came from residential installations while residential revenue was 26% of total revenue in 2020. The increase in residential revenue as a percentage of total revenue is the result of the Solcius Acquisition in April 2021. Approximately 23% of our total revenue in 2021 came from commercial installations, down from 74% in 2020.


Our residential operations address the needs of property owners by installing systems typically smaller than 20kW. We facilitate purchase or lease financing and offer multiple product options to fit the specific needs of each customer.
 
We install systems for the commercial market and for public works projects. We define small commercial and public works projects as the installation of systems under 100kW, whereas large projects involve the installation of systems greater than 100kW. Solar projects have received limited financing from traditional lending sources, but we are encouraged by municipal PACE programs in California which have drawn funding sources such as Ygrene Energy Fund into the financing of energy projects. Public works projects are frequently financed through various PPA arrangements, often in conjunction with SPURR (School Project for Utility Rate Reduction) programs, a Joint Powers Authority in California. Cycle times vary from twenty weeks to more than a year, depending on customer specifications, supply chain, permitting and engineering lead times. Agricultural system sizes vary significantly within this sector and can range from 10kW to multiple megawatts. Agricultural loans to farmers and tax-oriented leases are the primary funding sources within the industry. Similar to commercial installations, cycle times for agricultural projects may commonly range from a few months to more than three years depending upon the authority having jurisdiction, the existing utility infrastructure and the various approvals required.
 
Competitors
 
In the solar installation market, we compete with companies that offer products similar to ours. Some of these companies have greater financial resources, operational experience, and technical capabilities than we do. When bidding for solar installation projects, however, our current experience suggests that there is no clear dominant or preferred competitor in the markets in which we compete. We do not believe that any competitor has more than 10% of the market across all the areas in which we operate. We compete with other solar installers on pricing, service, warranty, and the ability to arrange financing. On a global scale, we also compete, on a cost basis, with traditional utilities that supply electricity to our potential customers and with companies that are not regulated like traditional utilities but that have access to the traditional utility electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure pursuant to state and local pro-competitive and consumer choice policies. Our advantage over traditional utilities is that we offer customers the opportunity to create their own electricity and reduce dependency from the traditional electrical grid.

Seasonality
 
Our revenue is impacted by seasonal weather patterns. In addition, some customers prefer to complete projects by the end of a calendar year to realize the benefits of available subsidy programs prior to year-end.
Technology and Intellectual Property
 
Generally, the solar installation business is not dependent on intellectual property. Within our residential business, we utilize proprietary software, which enables our sales channel partners to efficiently manage the sales process and allows our operations team to manage thousands of installations annually.
Government Regulation and Incentives
 
Government Regulation
 
We are not regulated as a public utility within the United States under applicable national, state or other local regulatory regimes where we conduct business.
 
To operate our systems, we obtain interconnection permission from the applicable local primary electric utility. Depending on the size of the solar energy system and local law requirements, interconnection permission is provided by the local utility to us or our customer. In almost all cases, interconnection permissions are issued on the basis of a standard process that has been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over net energy metering procedures. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection permission is given.
 
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws, including regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.
 
Government Incentives
 
Federal, state and local government bodies provide incentives to owners, end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments, payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments. These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge customers to own or lease our solar energy systems, helping to catalyze customer acceptance of solar energy as an alternative to utility-provided power.
 
The federal investment tax credit (“ITC”) is currently 26% under Section 48(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, for the installation of certain solar power facilities until December 31, 2022, after which the ITC will decrease to 22% in 2023 and 0% in 2024 for residential installations and 10% for commercial credit thereafter. Congress may extend or otherwise alter the Commercial ITC, as well as the depreciation benefits for solar, via legislation in 2022.


For commercial projects the economics of purchasing a solar energy system are also improved by eligibility for accelerated depreciation, also known as the modified accelerated cost recovery system (“MACRS”) depreciation, which allows for the depreciation of equipment according to an accelerated schedule set forth by the Internal Revenue Service. The acceleration of depreciation creates a valuable tax benefit that reduces the overall cost of the solar energy system and increases the return on investment.

Approximately 50% of U.S. states offer a personal or corporate investment or production tax credit for solar energy that is additive to the ITC. Further, these states, and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements, and credits. Many state governments, traditional utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer a rebate or other cash incentive for the installation and operation of a solar energy system or energy efficiency measures. Capital costs or “up-front” rebates provide funds to solar customers based on the cost, size or expected production of a customer’s solar energy system. Performance-based incentives provide cash payments to a system owner based on the energy generated by their solar energy system during a pre-determined period, and they are paid over that time period. Depending on the cost of the system and other site-specific variables, tax incentives can typically cover 30-40% of the cost of a commercial or residential solar system.


Many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production that requires regulated utilities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the state from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar energy systems, by a specified date.
