Vision
Innovid’s vision is to reimagine TV advertising. Our name stands for innovation in video, and originated from our desire to change how the world engages with TV and video advertisements. Our mission is to provide the infrastructure empowering advertisers to connect with consumers in a more personalized, data-driven and interactive manner.
Overview
We are a leading independent software platform that provides critical technology infrastructure for the creation, delivery, and measurement of TV ads across CTV, mobile TV and desktop TV environments. As of December 31, 2021, over 50% of the top 200 brands by US TV advertising spend according to Kantar Media and Winmo are utilizing our platform in their advertisement delivery infrastructure. Innovid’s revenue has grown alongside the growth of CTV advertising. We believe our open platform and purpose-built technology for CTV, combined with our position as a media-independent provider, has allowed us to win a large and growing market share, while the growth of CTV combined with our usage-based revenue model has further contributed to our rapid growth. In 2021, CTV accounted for 46% of all video impressions served by Innovid, up from 40% in 2020, a year-over-year increase of 47%. An impression is the metric used to quantify the number of views of an advertisement. Impressions are measured by cost per mile (CPM), where mile refers to 1,000 impressions (or cost per thousand). For example, a CTV ad might have a CPM of $25, meaning that the content owner receives $25 every time an ad is displayed 1,000 times within a designated program. Ad servers, such as Innovid, provide a pixel that is implemented within an ad. When an ad with that pixel loads, an impression is counted. Counting impressions is essential to how digital advertising is measured, accounted and paid for. We serve many of the top TV advertisers, including Anheuser-Busch InBev, CVS Pharmacy, Kellogg’s, Mercedes-Benz, Target, Sanofi, Volvo and many more, with such clients representing the key verticals we serve.
A key driver of CTV growth has been the evolving preferences of consumers. Consumers are increasingly cutting the cord and streaming TV content OTT through internet-connected devices rather than traditional broadcast, satellite or cable TV. We believe OTT content, which is typically delivered on-demand, seeks to provide a better user experience, and often saves the consumer money over traditional paid TV services. Advertisers seeking to engage these audiences are rapidly shifting dollars away from traditional TV mediums towards increasing budgets for CTV. Advertisers can also benefit from the shift to CTV as the digitally delivered ads can be personalized and measured in real time, similar to other digital advertising mediums such as internet browser-based formats. As a result, TV advertisers have better transparency, control and ultimately potential return on investment from their CTV advertising. 
Innovid’s purpose-built CTV infrastructure platform comprises three key offerings: Ad Serving Solutions, Creative Personalization Solutions and Measurement Solutions. Our software-based platform provides an open technology infrastructure that tightly integrates with the highly fragmented advertising technology and media ecosystem including demand side platforms such as The Trade Desk and Amobee; supply side platforms such as Magnite and Verizon Media; publishers such as Hulu and Peacock; and end user devices such as Amazon Fire and Samsung Smart TV. Our offerings encompass independent global ad serving, data-driven personalization, and new forms of measurement designed to connect all channels in a clean, comparable, and privacy-compliant manner. Although we work closely with the vendors who buy and sell media, our platform only facilitates the creation, delivery and measurement of advertisements and campaigns and we do not make purchasing decisions or facilitate the purchasing of advertisement inventory. Because we do not make ad buying or selling decisions we are able to maintain our independence and remain free of potential buying conflicts.
Our target clients comprise the largest global TV advertisers. In 2021, our blue-chip advertiser client base included over half of the top 200 brands by TV US advertising spend according to Kantar Media and Winmo. In addition, we work closely with the top advertising agency holding companies such as WPP, Publicis Groupe, Omnicom, Interpublic Group of Cos. and Dentsu. Our clients are diversified across all major industry verticals, including consumer packaged goods, pharmaceutical and healthcare, financial services, automotive and technology. We believe Innovid’s independence is critical to advertisers seeking an interoperable and open partner that is primarily focused on technology infrastructure. We define a core client as an advertiser that generates at least $100,000 of annual revenue. We have a history of strong growth in our core client base, with 109 core clients as of December 31,2021. No individual core client (brand/advertiser) represented more than 14% of 2021 revenue. Innovid serves customers globally through a delivery footprint covering over 75 countries, including the US, China, UK, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Israel, Singapore, Japan and Australia. In 2021 approximately 9% of Innovid’s revenue was generated by our customers outside of the US.
Our revenue model is based on impressions volume and the cost per impression for our various ad serving services. For our core ad serving platform, we generate revenue from our advertising customers based on the volume of advertising impressions delivered, enabling us to grow as our customers increase their digital ad spend and corresponding ad impressions. Additionally, we generate revenue from creative services based on flat fee per projects and measurement solutions based on the volume of advertising impressions measured. As we introduce new products such as advanced measurement and creative capabilities including personalization and interactivity, we expect to be able to charge higher prices per impression volume.
Industry Overview
As consumers rapidly shift their viewing from traditional linear TV to streaming TV, marketers and agencies are recognizing the need to make CTV a strategic focus. We believe that our business benefits from many of the most significant trends in digital marketing and advertising, including:
•Digitalization of TV Advertising. The advertising industry continues to see traditional mediums such as linear TV, radio, and OOH transition to digital channels and platforms. This has created a new environment where the operational silos that existed historically between linear and digital are being removed with new open software and technology platforms enabling this evolution. In particular, according to Dentsu, TV advertising is gravitating toward CTV due to its ability to provide the reach, addressability, interactivity, and measurability most commonly associated with digital media. 
•Consumers Are “Cutting the Cord” and Adopting Streaming Services with Advertisers Quickly Following Suit. According to Nielsen, CTV consumption has grown at one of the fastest rates for any sector of the ad market, driven by cord cutters moving from traditional pay TV services to OTT and CTV experiences. Ad dollars are following suit with spending migrating from traditional TV to CTV. According to eMarketer, US CTV advertising spending reached $14.4 billion in 2021, which is 18.2% of total TV ad spending, up from just 3.6% five years ago. That figure is projected to more than triple by 2025, demonstrating significant upside. 
•Rise of Advertising-Supported Content. AVOD services have emerged as a cost-effective alternative for price-conscious TV viewers. According to eMarketer, AVOD spending is estimated to grow 43% year-over-year, up to $11.2 billion of ad spend in 2022. Major streaming services who offer both ad-free and ad-supported tiers have seen the majority of subscribers, with 70% in the case of Hulu opting for the cheaper, ad-supported tier, according to a 2020 Decider article. According to Digiday, the market is seeing ad-supported services like The Roku Channel, Hulu, and Pluto TV gaining share. We believe this trend, combined with the rapid introduction of new ad-supported streaming services such as Peacock, HBO Max, Discovery+, and Paramount+, indicates that the move to AVOD is here for the long-term.
•Fragmentation Fuels Technology Consolidation. As of December 2020, there were more than 200 streaming services in the market, according to Gazette, presenting a significant challenge for advertisers trying to reach a large audience at scale. The growing ecosystem of disparate partners, each with their own unique formats, infrastructure and operating procedures has fueled increased demand for open and independent technology platforms that are able to connect and simplify workflows across the various closed ecosystems, or walled gardens, that restrict access to applications, content and/or media and an increasing universe of other media providers. Innovid has built an open and independent software platform with a wide moat driven by deep and exclusive integrations across the fragmented CTV ecosystem, allowing advertisers to consolidate the creation, delivery and measurement of digital TV ads on a single platform, independent of the large technology walled garden players who dominate many other parts of the digital world.
•Renewed Focus on User Experience. We believe untargeted ads served at a high frequency have lost favor to a new model focused on fewer, better ads. Marketers are adopting data-driven advertising strategies to improve creative relevance through personalized ads while at the same time optimizing ad delivery against key metrics such as reach and frequency in real-time. Technology plays a critical role in empowering advertisers to leverage data to improve relevance and provide the infrastructure for real-time optimization of ad delivery based on accurate measures across consumers.
About Innovid
CTV is a large and growing industry with significant upside potential, but it also has its own set of challenges. Innovid’s solutions are designed to solve three core areas of disruption for large advertisers shifting investment to CTV; the streaming and delivery of creative, personalization of creative, and measurement. Our solutions starts with the workflow for personalizing and delivering ads, a process that allows us to collect relevant information such as IP or device ID within our system to enable measurement of advertising. In the middle of this workflow loop is a complex ecosystem of providers that Innovid supports through collaboration and integration, but does not compete with. This includes Demand Side Platforms who enable programmatic ad buying.
The Innovid Platform 
Innovid powers many of the leading TV advertisers globally through its integrated solutions across CTV, mobile TV, desktop TV, display and other channels. The Innovid platform consists of three core offerings: Ad Serving, Creative Personalization and Measurement. Together, these offerings allow brands and advertisers to effectively deliver personalized ads to audiences and measure effectiveness across all major TV mediums.
Ad Serving Solutions
Innovid’s ad serving platform consists of three primary offerings: 
•Campaign Submission Form. Our CSF is a web-based portal used by clients to submit all advertising campaign information and creative assets. The CSF allows marketers to upload assets, which are then automatically validated and subjected to QA procedures to ensure compliance with approximately 55 different delivery format specifications. Validated assets are then automatically encoded to deliver multiple publisher-specific versions of a single base asset delivered by our customers. The CSF also allows advertisers to submit relevant vendor integrations (e.g., viewability and verification) and to set up creative ad rotation and swap strategies. We integrate with third-party APIs to seamlessly pass ad creative where third-party ad serving is not allowed.
•Campaign Management Tool. The CMT is our platform portal for campaign implementation and management. The CMT is our central hub for managing partner integrations, publisher tag generation, click-through and tracking management, as well as supporting QA. This workflow tool leverages multiple integrations and verification partners to streamline day-to-day operations, eliminate unnecessary work, expedite campaign launches and minimize reporting discrepancies.
•Analytics Dashboard: Our analytics dashboard provides a unified visualization of ad performance filterable by delivery, audience reach, device breakdown, viewability, verification and more. Within the UI, our custom report building feature allows users to customize and save their own templated reports, scheduling them for automatic delivery if desired. Our platform also provides several templates to guide users in their report building as well as integrating with third-party data visualization partners.
Creative Personalization Solutions 
Our DCO solution enables advertisers to generate millions of personalized ad versions from a single asset. Multiple tools within our creative optimization solution are proprietary to Innovid. 
•Software Development Kit . Our proprietary SDK allows CTV publishers to execute advanced video formats across all CTV devices and enables advanced measurement. The Innovid SDK is integrated with many of the leading CTV apps and devices, including a device-level integration in the Roku Ad Framework, a direct integration with Hulu, as well as integrations with a growing list of publishers and app developers, providing advanced video capabilities into more than 100 apps on all the leading devices. 
•Creative Composer Suite: We provide flexibility for designers and developers to author ads through any combination of internal, external, and/or code-based tools. Our ad authoring solutions allow clients to handle the design and development of interactive and personalized templates in tandem, which saves time and allows focus on the creative. Our proprietary suite features CTV Composer, an intuitive tool that enables the design of custom or templated interactive and dynamic CTV ads. We also offer Adobe and Google Web Designer plug-ins to streamline ad creation and data feed mapping, in addition to an open creative API for a code-based solution.
•Decision Trees. Our decision trees provide flexibility to create and visualize strategies using boolean logic across multiple data sets. Users can combine and prioritize across first-and third-party data sets such as geo, weather, date/time, audience, frequency, sequencing, publisher data, retargeting, and ISP. Within each decision tree branch, creatives can be managed via ad rotation, sequencing, and optimization. We can also connect directly to client APIs to build a custom strategy. 
•Dynamic Rendering Engine. Our proprietary dynamic rendering engine is robust, and uses automation to streamline workflows. It is designed to seamlessly pre-render dynamic static images, animations, and videos. These ads are assembled server-side (cloud) and in real-time upon ad request. Our proactive certification includes automated specifications compliance and video encoding, ensuring that ads are served at the highest possible quality across all publishers and devices, including 4K CTV. 
Measurement Solutions
Our MRC accredited measurement solutions are designed to provide holistic and granular household-level analysis for the TV and digital ecosystem. In addition to standard measurement and reporting included within Innovid’s ad serving solutions, we provide converged TV measurement through TVSquared by Innovid. Innovid acquired TVSquared, an independent global measurement and attribution platform for converged TV, in Q1 2022, establishing a global, independent measurement platform for linear TV, CTV, and digital. TVSquared by Innovid measures the complete TV universe, enabling accurate, always-on, identity-enabled measurement and attribution, at scale, for advertisers everywhere – driving brand growth and maximizing audience reach.

What We Do
We Are TV-Centric, with Omnichannel Reach
Our name Innovid stands for “Innovation in Video” based on our vision that one day the majority of video advertising would be delivered digitally, primarily to CTV devices. Our solutions were purpose-built with TV at the center to bridge the gap between linear TV and CTV, while providing for integrated customer experiences across video, display, social, audio, and more. The world’s leading advertisers have chosen Innovid to expand their CTV expertise while seamlessly managing advertising experiences across CTV, mobile TV, desktop TV, display, social, and audio. 
We Are Independent with No Media Buying Conflicts
Innovid provides unbiased, independent data measurement without media buying conflicts. Marketers are able to secure a window into walled garden performance with our preferred measurement solutions. Our independence allows us to work across all parties as a Facebook Preferred Measurement Partner, Google Measurement Partner, and YouTube ADH and Contextual Partner.
We Provide Infrastructure To Improve Advertising
Our goal is to allow customers to do more in less time, with easy-to-use AI-powered workflows that eliminate manual dependencies on individuals. Our easy-to-implement workflows, triggers and machine learning technology reduce reliance on manual processes to optimize investments. By removing tedious tasks that monopolize marketers’ time and energy, effort is able to be refocused on higher-impact strategic areas.
We Unify and Activate Data Across Channels
Data connectivity sets the foundation for addressable marketing. Innovid surfaces an integrated view of customer interactions through a single platform so advertisers can reach customers with true omni-channel messaging regardless of device. Innovid Key, our infrastructure approach to identity, unlocks numerous identity solutions, in concert with our proprietary household ID, in a privacy-safe manner to map signals across partners and approaches to enable an accurate and persistent method of identity in support of data-driven advertising natives. 
We Integrate Across the Ecosystem
Innovid solutions are designed for the heavily fragmented CTV ecosystem which is not dominated by specific providers. We provide comprehensive coverage across all key digital channels where our customers advertise. Our technology is integrated into major platforms that support programmatic media buying, measurement, viewability, verification and attribution, including Google, Comscore, DoubleVerify and The Trade Desk. As new media formats emerge, we believe the strength of our solutions and the flexibility of our software platform will allow us to seamlessly onboard new integration partners and secure new partnerships. For example, as CTV continues to become an increasingly prominent advertising channel, we have secured partnership agreements with multiple leading CTV platforms, including Roku and NBCU’s Peacock, that have certified our ad serving solutions for use on their platforms. We believe that we provide the broadest integration and partnership coverage across the industry.
We Personalize Advertising On Every Addressable Screen 
We strive to optimize personalized ad delivery everywhere our customers’ audiences are, in any format required. Whether taking full advantage of the combined power of sight, sound and motion through TV ads, or opting into display or audio formats, our solutions span the entire omni-channel universe. Innovid supports interactive and data-driven personalized ads on all digital platforms including connected devices, mobile, tablet, desktop, and digital out-of-home, including access into traditional walled gardens such as Facebook and YouTube. 
We Provide Transparent Measurement 
We provide transparent, comprehensive measurement across all addressable media. We believe our platform represents the widest breadth of MRC accredited metrics of any buy-side ad server, with accreditations spanning CTV, video, and display. Our measurement solutions reach across an expansive certified video publisher footprint, 25+ devices—including CTV, and all channels. Innovid is also a preferred measurement partner of major walled gardens and has invested in the TVSquared by Innovid measurement and attribution platform, inclusive of TV viewing and ad occurrence data across millions of households globally, creating an independent source of truth for advertisers.
Competitive Strengths 
We believe the following attributes and capabilities form our core strengths and provide us with competitive advantages:
A Market-Leading CTV Software Platform 
We offer a comprehensive cross-channel TV advertising technology infrastructure spanning publishers, partners, and channels. Our platform maintains a robust global publisher certification footprint with an entire team dedicated to publisher certifications. We are certified to run on all major device types including CTV, mobile TV, desktop TV, and the open web across all major publishers and walled gardens. Our tags provide an expansive measurable reach across 25+ connected devices including: Roku, tvOS, Amazon Fire, Samsung, Smart TVs, PS, XBox. 
Focus on CTV Innovation 
Since inception we have pioneered infrastructure required to support the growth of CTV advertising. We have achieved a growing list of industry first and key milestones including being the first ACR integration with Roku, the first buy-side ad server with MRC certification for CTV measurement, the first and only platform delivering ads into NBCU’s Peacock, the exclusive ad delivery platform supporting the 2020 Tokyo and 2022 Beijing Olympic Games, as well as the first interactive Super Bowl ad. 
Open and Independent Platform
We are a software infrastructure solution, providing technology that supports and facilitates CTV advertising across a wide footprint of publishers, channels and devices. We do not buy or sell media, which means we do not compete with media providers or other technology platforms who recognize revenue based on a percentage of spend, nor are we incentivized to direct advertising spend based on company interests. Our media independence allows us to take a neutral stance and partner across the ad tech landscape, including with closed ecosystems such as Amazon, Facebook, and YouTube, as well as emerging CTV players like Peacock, where we are the exclusive third-party ad serving partner. Innovid’s independence is critical to advertisers seeking an interoperable, open partner who offers transparent solutions and can work across the fragmented CTV market currently dominated by providers who largely compete with one another.
Deep Technical Expertise and Industry Certifications 
Innovid has met the rigorous technical demands of third-party ad serving in live TV viewing experiences, which has led to forging exclusive partnerships with some of the largest streaming providers and events in the market. We have successfully set a new standard for creative quality control in CTV advertising. This has culminated in Innovid being named the exclusive third-party ad server for the 2020 Tokyo and 2022 Beijing Olympic Games. These partners and events are using our platform exclusively for the delivery, personalization and measurement of CTV ads. 
Growth Strategy 
We intend to continue penetrating the advertising market through the following key growth areas, which we believe will help us continue to gain market share in the markets we serve. 
Growing with Our Current Customers
As TV investment continues to shift from linear to CTV, we expect to continue to benefit from the natural volume growth of CTV impressions. We have driven consistently positive net revenue retention of our core client base, those that spend $100,000 or more annually, largely through increased CTV advertising volume. As legacy TV budgets migrate from linear TV to CTV we anticipate there will be significant growth upside in the coming years. 
Upsell Additional Products and Solutions to Our Existing Customers
We will continue to invest in cross-selling and upselling existing customers. We cross-sell our personalized creative solutions to primary ad serving customers, who, for example, launch with standard TV ads then introduce personalized formats over time. We believe there is an opportunity to cross-sell our advanced measurement solutions to provide real-time metrics to inform optimization of cross-platform campaigns while in market, a departure from the traditional delayed post-campaign reporting widely available in market.
Expand Our International Presence 
The majority of our clients are global advertisers and operate at a significant scale. We intend to continue to grow our footprint in international markets in order to meet the needs of our global customer base and accelerate new customer acquisition in key geographies outside of North America. 
Win New Client Accounts
We intend to continue targeting new brand, media agency and digital publisher customers who are currently utilizing solutions provided by our competitors or point solutions. We see a significant opportunity to grow our customer base by introducing enhanced capabilities with an emphasis on data, identity resolution and cross-channel measurement. 
Pursue M&A Opportunities
Our management team has a proven track record of identifying, evaluating, executing and integrating strategic acquisitions. Innovid completed the acquisition of TVSquared, a leading independent global measurement and attribution platform for converged TV, in 2022. Through this acquisition we expanded our technology and solutions offerings to encompass real-time, cross-platform analysis, including outcomes such as reach, frequency and unduplicated reach, as well as performance metrics. Additionally, the acquisition added approximately 145 employees with expertise in measurement and attribution while broadening our geographic footprint in Europe and expanding measurement capabilities to over 75 countries. We maintain an active pipeline of potential M&A targets and intend to continue evaluating add-on opportunities to bolster our current solutions suite and complement our organic growth initiatives. 
Partnerships and Integrations 
In a market that has been trending towards walled garden consolidation, we believe our independence allows us to work with any publisher or partner, without media bias or ad-buying conflicts of interest. Because of this open platform approach, we have been able to develop deep integrations with partners across the ad tech ecosystem. 
Innovid’s integrations are designed to automate workflow and streamline the development and distribution of advertisements, all the while saving marketers time and money. Innovid integrations include:
•Campaign Workflow Integrations. Campaign management and trafficking integrations with DSPs like The Trade Desk, digital asset management vendors such as AdStream and billing partners such as Mediaocean (Prisma), streamline day-to-day workflow by eliminating unnecessary work, expediting campaign launches, and minimizing reporting discrepancies. 
•Brand Safety and Ad Fraud Integrations. Innovid supports deep verification, viewability, and ad blocking capabilities with vendors such as Moat, IAS, DV, Nielsen, and Comscore. 
•Media Providers and Walled Garden Integrations. Innovid’s independent third-party ad tags are accepted by media providers and content platforms globally. Innovid is a Google Preferred Measurement Partner and is fully integrated with Google’s Ads Data Hub. Innovid is also a Preferred Measurement and Creative Partner of Facebook and Instagram.
•Data and Creative Personalization Integrations. Innovid maintains server-to-server integrations to enable ad decisioning from audience segments and/or IDs passed from partners. We integrate with leading Data Managment Platforms (DMPs) such as LiveRamp, Oracle, Neustar, Salesforce, and Adobe. Innovid also supports creative decision-making based on audience data passed directly from the brand’s choice of Demand Side Platform (DSP). Examples include, but are not limited to Adobe, Verizon Media and The Trade Desk.
•Creative Ad Authoring Integrations. Innovid provides full flexibility for designers and developers to curate ads through any combination of internal, external, and/or code-based tools. Integrations include Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, and Google Web Designer. 
•Brand Research and Attribution Integrations. Brand study partners directly integrated with Innovid include Comscore, Nielsen DAR, and Kantar (Millward Brown). Innovid is also able to implement third-party pixels to support direct tracking or pursue deeper integrations with other third-party measurement providers. 
•Data Visualization Integrations. Third-party data processing and analytics tools can tap into Innovid’s Data API or connect to a raw data feed to receive Innovid data for further analysis.
•Third Party Ad Server Integrations. Innovid enables brands to leverage the power of our omni-channel ad serving and analytics platform through 1x1 pixels, while continuing to use other ad servers to manage their search campaigns and multi-touch attribution goals. 
Certifications and Accreditations
As an independent ad server, Innovid is deeply invested in ensuring the accuracy of our ad delivery and measurement on behalf of our clients. Proactive publisher certification prior to campaign launch can significantly reduce the number of data discrepancies and/or errors with the rendering of tags. 
Innovid’s publisher certification process is supported via a dedicated certification team that maintains a database of thousands of publishers, networks, and exchanges. The process is made up of both a functional and discrepancy test to ensure all ads are rendered at their highest possible quality, all pixels are firing correctly, and reporting is as expected. Our team certifies publishers pre-campaign, verifying compliance with Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and MRC standards. When ads are uploaded to our platform our system automatically references Innovid’s publisher certification database. Our automatic encoding engine then instantly resizes ads to individual publisher specs, from a single asset, to meet the requirements for each partner on a media plan. 
Innovid also holds industry-leading MRC accreditations, a common standard for media transacting with leading advertisers, spanning CTV, video and display ad formats. The MRC establishes industry standards for valid, reliable and effective media measurement. Innovid has been accredited with the MRC since 2013 for impressions and viewable impressions on desktops, mobile webs, and mobile apps. In 2018, the MRC granted Innovid the first ever MRC accreditation for OTT video ad impression measurement, cementing an important milestone in the industry’s ongoing evolution in this space. As a result of this accreditation, Innovid’s accredited metrics and methodologies have been independently vetted by the MRC to confirm they are valid, reliable and effective.
Customers
During 2021 Innovid served as the ad delivery platform for over 50% of the top 200 TV advertisers in the US including Anheuser-Busch InBev, Kellogg’s, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and many more, with such clients representing key verticals we serve and Anheuser-Busch InBev, Kellogg’s and Volvo each a core client (brand/advertiser). Our clients are comprised of the largest TV advertisers, with the majority of our customers typically coming from large global enterprises. We define a customer as an entity that generates revenue during a certain period of time. A single organization with multiple divisions, segments or subsidiaries is treated as a single customer, even though we may enter into commercial agreements with multiple parties within that organization.
We define a core client as an advertiser that generates at least $100,000 of annual revenue. Looking at our core clients on an annual basis and presenting related metrics only on an annual basis rather than also on an interim basis helps us avoid overstating or understating the importance of certain customers to our overall business based on their spending in any particular period. We also believe analyzing customers and revenue retention on an annual basis allows investors to better evaluate the long-term performance of our business.
We have a history of strong growth in our core client base. Together our core clients typically generated more than 80% of our annual revenue from 2019 through 2021, demonstrating our continued focus on large enterprise customers.
The number of advertisers that generated more than $100,000 of annual revenue has increased sequentially year-over-year, driven by our existing customers’ retention as a result of their continued success using our solutions and the growing adoption of our business platform by existing customers for additional use cases. Additionally, we experienced growth in the number of new advertiser customers that contributed more than $100,000 of revenue.
Our clients are diversified across all major industry verticals, including consumer packaged goods, pharmaceutical and healthcare, financial services, automotive and technology. No single advertiser accounted for more than 14% of our revenue in 2021, with such advertisers representing brands that contract with us directly, or through third party agencies and publishers, or some combination thereof.
Competition
We primarily compete with Google, specifically their technology platforms and digital content monetization services. While the markets we serve are highly competitive and rapidly evolving, most of our competitors offer point solutions that represent a subset of the solutions that are available on our business platform. Additional competitors include vendors focused on DCO; we also compete with advertising measurement point solutions.
Our industry faces the following competitive dynamics:
•the ability to reach and engage with viewers in CTV environments enabled through exclusive premium publisher partnerships and proprietary SDK technology;
•the ability to holistically manage the personalization and delivery of ads dynamically across all addressable formats and channels;
•the ability to automate the ad delivery workflow to reduce rejection rates and decrease manual resources required to deliver TV and other digital ads into addressable environments;
•the ability to provide unified and consistent MRC-accredited measurement of digital ads across all available formats and channels;
•the ability to innovate and adapt product offerings to emerging addressable media technologies and offer products that meet changing customer needs;
•the ability to support large, global customers and develop and maintain complex integrations with key partners across the advertising ecosystem;
•the ability to achieve and maintain industry accreditations; and
•the ability to collect advertising data across platforms and provide independent measurement to our customers.
Talent and Culture
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had 396 full time employees across 9 offices in 5 countries, with 138 employees in research and development and related activities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes enabling the vast majority of our employees to work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing on-site work where legally possible. 
Talent Acquisition and Development 
We are focused on recruiting and retaining talented employees across the organization, with a particular focus on unique talent in CTV, product, analytics and many other areas that are critical to our success. We continue to invest to hire and retain top talent in all of our offices. We were named to Inc. magazine’s annual list of the Best Workplaces for 2021. Innovid was also named by Inc. as a winner in the Established Excellence: 5-14 years in business category. Our strong reputation has contributed to over 10,000 candidates applying to work at Innovid in 2021. For new hires, we have a robust onboarding program tailored towards individual roles and responsibilities. On an ongoing basis, we invest in training and development programs that help our employees achieve their career goals and build management skills. We have two formal career feedback discussions per year where managers and their employees discuss progress and feedback for each other. We believe in developing and promoting top talent from within: in 2021, one out of every five of our employees was offered an opportunity for career advancement within the company.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Innovid is committed to fostering, cultivating and preserving a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. We embrace and encourage our employees’ differences in age, color, disability, ethnicity, family or marital status, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, physical and mental ability, race, religion, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, veteran status, and other characteristics that make our employees unique.
Innovid’s policies are applicable, but not limited, to our practices and policies on recruitment and selection, compensation and benefits, professional development and training, promotions, transfers, social and recreational programs, layoffs, terminations, and the ongoing development of a work environment built on the premise of diversity equity and inclusion that encourages and enforces:
•Respectful communication and cooperation among all employees;
•Teamwork and employee participation, permitting the representation of all individuals and employee perspectives;
•Work/life balance through flexible work schedules to accommodate employees’ varying needs; and
•Contributions to the communities we serve to promote a greater understanding and respect for diversity, equity and inclusion. 
All employees of Innovid have a responsibility to treat others with dignity and respect at all times. All employees deserve a work environment free from all forms of discrimination. Innovid similarly prohibits retaliation against employees who file complaints under this policy or who participate in complaint investigations. Any employee found to have exhibited any inappropriate conduct or behavior against others may be subject to disciplinary action. Employees who believe they have been subjected to any kind of discrimination are required to advise HR, their department’s VP or a member of the management team.
Innovid’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion achieved measurable results in 2021. New U.S employees hired during 2021 were 49% BIPOC and 49% women. Existing employee promotions across 2021 were granted to women 49% of the time globally and Black and Indigenous people of color (BIPOC) employees 30% of the time in the US. Additionally several other diversity-focused initiatives including behaviors of inclusion training, compensation audits and a paid internship program were implemented during calendar year 2021.
Regulatory Matters 
Data Privacy and Data Protection Laws
Data privacy and data protection legislation and regulation play a significant role in our business. We and our clients use personal data about internet users collected through our platform to manage and execute digital advertising campaigns in a variety of ways, including delivering advertisements to internet users based on their particular geographic locations, the type of device they are using, or their interests as inferred from their web browsing or app usage activity. We do not use this data to further identify specific individuals, and we do not seek to associate this data with information that can be used to further identify specific individuals. We take all required steps to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws, including encryption of personal data and deletion of personal data upon request and automatically after one year. The definitions of personally identifiable information, personal information, personal data and similar terms, however, vary by jurisdiction and are evolving. As a result, our platform and business practices must be assessed regularly in each jurisdiction where we do business to avoid violating applicable legislation and regulation.
Data Privacy Regulation in the US
In the United States, at both the federal and state level, there are laws that govern activities such as the collection and use of data by companies. At the federal level, online advertising activities are subject to regulation by the FTC, which has primarily relied upon Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits companies from engaging in “unfair” or “deceptive” trade practices, including alleged violations of representations concerning privacy protections and acts that allegedly violate individuals’ privacy interests. There are also other data privacy laws that apply. For example, we send marketing emails and are therefore subject to the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or the CAN SPAM Act, which established specific requirements for commercial email messages, specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content, and obligates, among other things, the sender of commercial emails to provide recipients with the ability to opt out of receiving future commercial emails from the sender.
There has been increased regulation of data privacy and security in the United States, particularly at the state level. Some proposed and newly enacted legislation at state level has affected and will continue to affect, our operations and those of our industry partners. For example, the CCPA, which came into effect in January 2020, defines “personal information” broadly enough to include online identifiers provided by individuals’ devices, such as IP addresses, and establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses. The CCPA expanded privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California and imposes more stringent obligations on companies regarding the level of information and control they provide to users about the collection and sharing of their data. Moreover, the CPRA, was approved by California voters in November 2020 and will further modify and expand the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain personal information and creating a new state agency to oversee implementation and enforcement efforts. The CPRA will come into effect on January 1, 2023. Further, Virginia has adopted a new state data protection act referred to as the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, which is also set to take effect on January 1, 2023. Additionally, Colorado has adopted a new state data protection act titled the Colorado Privacy Act, which is set to take effect on July 1, 2023.
Data Privacy Regulation in Europe
Our business activities are also subject to foreign legislation and regulation. In the EEA, separate laws and regulations (and member states’ implementations thereof) govern the processing of personal data, and these laws and regulations continue to impact us. Like the CCPA, the EEA GDPR, defines “personal data” broadly, and it significantly enhances data protection obligations for controllers of such data and for service providers, called “processors,” processing the data. It also provides certain rights, such as access and deletion, to the individuals about whom the personal data relates and we have adapted our services to accommodate such rights. We are subject to the EEA GDPR and also the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, e.g. fines up to the greater of €20 million / £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the United Kingdom, enabling data transfers from EU member states to the United Kingdom without additional safeguards. However, the UK adequacy decision will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission re-assesses and renews/ extends that decision, and remains under review by the Commission during this period. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how UK data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated in the long term. These changes will lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. 
In any event, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to the transfer of personal data outside the EEA and the UK. For the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the US, we rely upon direct contractual agreements between Innovid’s US corporate entity and our customers. These contractual agreements obligate Innovid’s US operations to uphold adequate data protection measures (appropriate safeguards, enforceable data subject rights, and effective legal remedies for data subjects) on all data that Innovid transfers to the US from the EEA or UK on its own behalf and on behalf of its clients and partners. Recent legal developments in the EEA and the UK have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal information from the EEA and the UK to “third countries,” especially the United States. For example, a recent decision of the Court of Justice of the EU invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (a mechanism for the transfer of personal information from the EEA to the US) and made clear that reliance on standard contractual clauses (another mechanism for the transfer of personal data outside the EEA) may not be sufficient, on their own, to provide appropriate safeguards for transfers of personal data from the EU to the United States (and other non-EEA countries). In addition, in June 2021, the European Commission implemented new versions of the Standard Contractual Clauses, under which parties transferring personal data from the EEA to third countries with “inadequate data protection” such as the US will have until December 27, 2022 to update any existing agreements, or any new agreements executed before September 27, 2021, that rely on Standard Contractual Clauses as the data transfer mechanism. The new Standard Contractual Clauses apply only to the transfer of data outside of the EEA and not the U.K., though in August 2021 the U.K.’s Information Commissioner’s Officer launched a public consultation on it proposals for its own form of agreement and addendum to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses either of which could be used for transfers for data from the U.K. Companies that engage in these transfers, like Innovid, need to undertake data transfer risk assessments and implement any “supplementary measures” necessary to address any risks identified in order to ensure that the data they transfer continues to be protected to a standard that is essentially equivalent with the GDPR. We currently rely on standard contractual clauses and these changes are therefore causing us to review our current compliance approach and may result in additional compliance costs or the inability to transfer personal data outside of the EEA and/or the United Kingdom. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data transfer mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used, and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or injunctions against processing personal data from the EEA and U.K., and if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results.
We are also subject to evolving EEA and UK privacy laws on cookies and e-marketing which require informed consent for the placement of most cookies or similar technologies on a user’s device and for direct electronic marketing. In the EEA and the UK, regulators are increasingly focusing on compliance with these requirements in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem and are increasingly taking action to enforce them. The EEA GDPR and UK GDPR also impose conditions on obtaining valid consent, such as a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to ensure separate consents are sought for each type of cookie or similar technology. In addition, the current national laws in the EEA that implement the e-Privacy Directive are highly likely to be replaced by an EU regulation known as the e-Privacy Regulation which will significantly increase fines for noncompliance. The text of the e-Privacy Regulation is still under development, and recent EU regulatory guidance and court decisions have created uncertainty about the level to which such laws and regulations will be enforced, which may require us to review our compliance approach and increase compliance costs.
Data Privacy Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region
Our business activities are also subject to legislation and regulation in the Asia-Pacific region. Following the implementation of the GDPR, many jurisdictions have moved to amend, release, review and strengthen their existing data privacy and cyber-security laws, and there has been a progressive effort in the region to work towards coordinating their otherwise disparate laws. Many countries have also sought adequacy decisions from the EU. New Zealand’s updated Privacy Act and South Korea’s amendments to its Personal Information Protection Act, went into effect in 2020, largely aligning with requirements of the GDPR. Thailand’s and Japan’s new similar updates and regulations will also become effective in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Other jurisdictions, such as India, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, are reviewing their existing privacy regimes, with an eye toward similar data protection developments. 
To address this range of developments, Innovid’s data protection program is largely rooted in the GDPR and SOC2 security standards, and any international data transfers from the Asia-Pacific region are governed by direct contractual agreements between the regional entities and Innovid’s US parent corporate entity, Innovid, Corp. Otherwise, our compliance team works to oversee compliance with these Asia-Pacific regional requirements and to address compliance with our region-specific clients and business teams.
Innovid’s General Data Protection and Consumer Privacy Practices
Innovid is dedicated to a high standard of consumer privacy and data protection, while maintaining quality online Advertising Services to various advertisers, agencies, publishers and other businesses across various third party websites and online media. 
Innovid has restrictive policies for the collection, use and sharing of consumer data. We maintain membership with the NAI, a self-regulatory association dedicated to responsible data collection and its use for digital advertising, and the DAA, an independent organization led by advertising and marketing trade associations that has established self-regulatory principles enforcing responsible privacy practices for digital advertising and consumer transparency. Innovid also maintains accreditation with the MRC.
Innovid’s collection of consumer data generally consists of basic data elements associated with advertisements served or measured by Innovid, such as impressions, clicks, viewing duration, IP address, date and time of interaction, information about the general geographical location from which a consumer is viewing an advertisement, device type, and other generic identifiers made available by the browser or device. Innovid collects these data elements on behalf of its clients in a data privacy-compliant manner, in order to effectively measure and evaluate the performance of the client’s advertising campaigns, deliver, schedule and sequence ads, administer the client’s account, and provide the client with engagement analysis.
At a client’s request, Innovid may assist the client with targeting its ads based on the client’s first-party data or based on data from the client’s selected data management platform. Innovid also offers frequency and ad personalization features such as ad sequencing and creative decisioning based on factors such as general geographic location. Innovid receives user segments from its customers to conduct real-time ad decisioning, but does not create or retain such segments itself. Innovid also does not collect any categories of data deemed sensitive under applicable laws or NAI standards. In a limited number of use cases, the client also has the option to have Innovid collect consumer email addresses or phone numbers on its behalf from selected advertising formats; in these cases, such opt-in data is used solely to fulfill the client’s request.
Innovid upholds consumer choice. Innovid believes consumers should have the right to control how they are targeted across online media. Innovid respects the consumer’s choice to opt-out of interest-based advertising. 
Data Security and Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations
Innovid is committed to data security and takes a variety of measures in line with industry practice to safeguard the data in its possession from unauthorized alteration, destruction, access or misuse. We maintain tight controls over all the data we collect, retaining it in firewalled and secured databases with strictly limited and controlled access rights, designed to ensure that the data is secure. Additional security measures include encryption of personal information at rest and in transit, maintaining a strict password policy, the use of multi-factor authentication for key systems, maintaining antivirus measures and vulnerability management policies, and the use of various security technologies designed to prevent unauthorized activity.
Innovid maintains compliance with the EU GDPR and UK GDPR. Innovid has in place the EU-approved Standard Contractual Clauses with data exporters from the EU. Innovid has appointed a data protection officer, has a process for responding in a timely manner to data subjects seeking to exercise their rights under GDPR, and takes a proactive approach to putting the necessary contractual provisions in place with its vendors and clients. 
Innovid has taken a comprehensive approach to CCPA compliance and will continue to monitor and adjust its approach as the law continues to evolve, to ensure we maintain compliance with the latest regulations, requirements and best practices. As between Innovid and its clients, Innovid is a service provider and does not sell personal information as contemplated under CCPA. 
Data policy and privacy regulations are dynamic and constantly changing. In addition to performing yearly internal audits, Innovid continues to monitor its compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Intellectual Property
We consider our trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, patent and other intellectual property rights, including those in our know-how and the software code of our proprietary technology, to be important components of our success. We rely on intellectual property laws, including trade secret, copyright and trademark laws in the United States and abroad, and use contracts, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property. 
As of July 16, 2021, we had 13 granted patents, two pending patent applications, and six trademark applications covering a variety of interactive and contextual analysis capabilities. We have also registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.innovid.com. 
We design, test and update our products, services and websites regularly, and we have developed our proprietary solutions in-house. Our know-how is an important element of our intellectual property. The development and management of our platform requires sophisticated coordination among many specialized employees. We take steps to protect our know-how, trade secrets and other confidential information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, developers and vendors who have access to our confidential information, and generally limiting access to and distribution of our confidential information. To protect our technology against unauthorized access, we also implement multiple layers of security. Access to our platform, other than to obtain basic information, requires system usernames and passwords. 
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would advance our business objectives and maintain our competitive position.
