 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  History
  
 We were incorporated in the State of Colorado on August 31, 2006 under the name “Mountain West Business Solutions, Inc.” Until October 2009, our business was to provide management consulting with regard to accounting, computer and general business issues for small and home-office based companies.
  
 In October 2009, we acquired Sunshine Biopharma, Inc., a Colorado corporation holding an exclusive license to a new anticancer drug bearing the laboratory name, Adva-27a. As a result of this transaction we changed our name to “Sunshine Biopharma, Inc. and our officers and directors resigned their positions with us and were replaced by Sunshine’s management at the time, including our current CEO, Dr. Steve N. Slilaty, and our current CFO, Camille Sebaaly each of whom remain part of our current management. Our principal business became that of a pharmaceutical company focusing on the development of our licensed Adva-27a anticancer compound. In December 2015 we acquired all issued and pending patents pertaining to our Adva-27a technology and terminated the license. See “Part I, Item 1 – Business - Intellectual Property,” below for a more detailed explanation of this acquisition.
  
 In July 2014, we formed a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, Sunshine Biopharma Canada Inc. (“Sunshine Canada”), for the purposes of offering generic pharmaceutical products in Canada and elsewhere around the world. Sunshine Canada has recently signed licensing agreements for four (4) generic prescription drugs for the treatment of cancer and BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia).
  
 In January 2018, we acquired Atlas Pharma Inc., a certified company dedicated to chemical analysis of pharmaceutical and other industrial samples whose operations are authorized by a Drug Establishment License issued by Health Canada.
  
 In March 2018, we formed NOX Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Colorado corporation and assigned all of our interest in our Adva-27a anticancer compound to that company.
  
 Our principal place of business is located at 6500 Trans-Canada Highway, 4th Floor, Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada H9R 0A5. . Our phone number is (514) 426-6161and our website address is www.sunshinebiopharma.com.
  
  Business Operations
  
 As of the date of this report we are operating through the following wholly owned subsidiaries:
  
   ●
 NOX Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a recently formed Colorado company focused on the research, development and commercialization of proprietary drugs for the treatment of cancer including Adva-27a, a multi-purpose anti-tumor compound targeted for the treatment of multidrug resistant cancer;

 
   ●
 Sunshine Biopharma Canada Inc., a Canadian company, which offers generic prescription drugs for the treatment of cancer and other acute and chronic indications; and

 
   ●
 Atlas Pharma Inc., a Canadian company acquired in January 2018, offering certified chemical analysis of pharmaceutical and other industrial samples.

  Proprietary Drug Development Operations
  
 Since inception, our proprietary drug development activities have been focused on the development of a small molecule called Adva-27a for the treatment of aggressive forms of cancer. A Topoisomerase II inhibitor, Adva-27a has been shown to be effective at destroying Multidrug Resistant Cancer cells including Pancreatic Cancer cells, Breast Cancer cells, Small-Cell Lung Cancer cells and Uterine Sarcoma cells (Published in ANTICANCER RESEARCH, Volume 32, Pages 4423-4432, October 2012). Sunshine Biopharma is direct owner of all issued and pending worldwide patents pertaining to Adva-27a including U.S. Patent Number 8,236,935. See “Part I, Item 1 – Business - Intellectual Property.”
  
 
 Adva-27a is a GEM-difluorinated C-glycoside derivative of Podophyllotoxin. Another derivative of Podophyllotoxin called Etoposide is currently on the market and is used to treat various types of cancer including leukemia, lymphoma, testicular cancer, lung cancer, brain cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer and several other forms of cancer. Etoposide is one of the most widely used anticancer drugs. Adva-27a and Etoposide are similar in that they both attack the same target in cancer cells, namely the DNA unwinding enzyme, Topoisomerase II. Unlike Etoposide, and other anti-tumor drugs currently in use, Adva-27a is able to destroy Multidrug Resistant Cancer cells. Adva-27a is the only compound known today that is capable of destroying Multidrug Resistant Cancer. In addition, Adva-27a has been shown to have distinct and more desirable biological and pharmacological properties compared to Etoposide. In side-by-side studies using Multidrug Resistant Breast Cancer cells and Etoposide as a reference, Adva-27a showed markedly improved cell killing activity (see Figure below). Our preclinical studies to date have shown that:
  
  ●
  Adva-27a is effective at killing different types of Multidrug Resistant cancer cells, including Pancreatic Cancer Cells (Panc-1), Breast Cancer Cells (MCF-7/MDR), Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells (H69AR), and Uterine Sarcoma Cells (MES-SA/Dx5).

 
  ●
  Adva-27a is unaffected by P-Glycoprotein, the enzyme responsible for making cancer cells resistant to anti-tumor drugs.

 
  ●
  Adva-27a has excellent clearance time (half-life = 54 minutes) as indicated by human microsomes stability studies and pharmacokinetics data in rats.

 
  ●
  Adva-27a clearance is independent of Cytochrome P450, a mechanism that is less likely to produce toxic intermediates.

 
  ●
  Adva-27a is an excellent inhibitor of Topoisomerase II with an IC50 of only 13.7 micromolar (this number has recently been reduce to 1.44 micromolar as a result of resolving the two isomeric forms of Adva-27a).

 
  ●
  Adva-27a has shown excellent pharmacokinetics profile as indicated by studies done in rats.

 
  ●
  Adva-27a does not inhibit tubulin assembly.

 
  

 
    These and other preclinical data have been published in ANTICANCER RESEARCH, a peer-reviewed International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment. The publication which is entitled “Adva-27a, a Novel Podophyllotoxin Derivative Found to Be Effective Against Multidrug Resistant Human Cancer Cells” [ANTICANCER RESEARCH 32: 4423-4432 (2012)] is available on our website at www.sunshinebiopharma.com.
  
 
 We have been delayed in our clinical development program due to lack of funding. Our fund raising efforts are continuing and as soon as adequate financing is in place we will continue our clinical development program of Adva-27a by conducting the following next sequence of steps:
  
  ●
  GMP Manufacturing of 2 kilogram for use in IND-Enabling Studies and Phase I Clinical Trials

  ●
  IND-Enabling Studies

  ●
  Regulatory Filing (Fast-Track Status Anticipated)

  ●
  Phase I Clinical Trials (Pancreatic Cancer Indication)

 On November 14, 2014, we entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement with Lonza Ltd. and Lonza Sales Ltd. (hereinafter jointly referred to as “Lonza”), whereby we engaged Lonza to be the manufacturer of our Adva-27a anticancer drug. In June 2015 we received a sample of the pilot manufacturing run for evaluation. Our laboratory analyses showed that, while the sample meets all of the required chemical, physical and biological specifications, the amount of material generated (the “Yield”) by the pilot run was found to be significantly lower than anticipated. We are currently working towards finding possible solutions to increase the Yield and define a path forward. During the course of our discussions concerning the problem of the low Yield, Lonza informed us that they required us to pay them $687,818 prior to moving forward with any activity pertaining to the manufacturing agreement we have with them. We have repeatedly indicated to Lonza that a clear path defining exactly how the extremely low Yield issue would be addressed is imperative prior to us making any payments. As of the date of this report, neither party has changed its position. See “Part I, Item 3 – Legal Proceedings.”
  
 Adva-27a’s initial indication will be pancreatic cancer for which there are currently little or no treatment options available. We are planning to conduct our clinical trials at McGill University’s Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, Canada. All aspects of the clinical trials in Canada will employ FDA standards at all levels. Subject to obtaining the necessary financing, we now anticipate that Phase I clinical trials will commence in mid-2019 and we estimate that it will take 18 months to complete, at which time we expect to receive limited marketing approval for “compassionate-use” under the FDA and similar guidelines in Canada.
  
 According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 1.5 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. each year.  Given the terminal and limited treatment options available for the pancreatic cancer and multidrug resistant breast cancer indications we are planning to study, we anticipate being granted limited marketing approval (“compassionate-use”) for our Adva-27a following receipt of funding and a successful Phase I clinical trial.  There are no assurances that either will occur.  Such limited approval will allow us to make the drug available to various hospitals and health care centers for experimental therapy and/or “compassionate-use”, thereby generating revenues in the near-term.
  
 We believe that upon successful completion of Phase I Clinical Trials we may receive one or more offers from large pharmaceutical companies to buyout or license our drug.  However, there are no assurances that our Phase I Trials will be successful, or if successful, that any pharmaceutical companies will make an acceptable offer to us.  In the event we do not consummate such a transaction, we will require significant capital in order to manufacture and market our new drug.

  Generic Pharmaceuticals Operations
  
 In 2016, our Canadian wholly owned subsidiary, Sunshine Biopharma Canada Inc. (“Sunshine Canada”), signed Cross Referencing Agreements with a major pharmaceutical company for four prescription generic drugs for the treatment of Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer and Enlarged Prostate. Following this acquisition we have been working towards commencement of marketing of these pharmaceutical products under our own Sunshine Biopharma label. These four generic products are as follows:
  
  ●
  Anastrozole (brand name Arimidex® by AstraZeneca) for treatment of Breast Cancer;

  ●
  Letrozole (brand name Femara® by Novartis) for treatment of Breast Cancer;

  ●
  Bicalutamide (brand name Casodex® by AstraZeneca) for treatment of Prostate Cancer;

  ●
  Finasteride (brand name Propecia® by Merck) for treatment of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)

 
 Worldwide sales of the brand name version of these products as reported by the respective pharmaceutical company, owner of the registered trademark are as follows:
  
  ●
  Arimidex® $232M in 2016

  ●
  Femara® $380M in 2014

  ●
  Casodex® $247M in 2016

  ●
  Propecia® $183M in 2015

 
 Sunshine Canada is currently in the process of securing a Drug Identification Number (“DIN”) for each of these products from Health Canada. We are planning to use part of the already approved Atlas Pharma Inc. space as a drug warehouse to facilitate the process of obtaining a Drug Establishment License (“DEL”) from Health Canada. Upon receipt of the DEL and DIN’s, we will be able to accept orders for our own label SBI-Anastrozole, SBI-Letrozole, SBI-Bicalutamide and SBI-Finasteride. We cannot estimate the timing in our obtaining either the DIN’s or the DEL due to variables involved that are out of our control. The figure below shows our 30-Pill blister pack of Anastrozole.
  
 
 We currently have twenty three (23) additional Generic Pharmaceuticals under review for in-licensing. While no assurances can be provided that we will acquire the rights to all or any of these drugs, we are confident we will acquire most, if not all of these rights.. We believe that a larger product portfolio will provide us with more opportunities and a greater reach into the marketplace. We hope to further build our generics portfolio of “SBI” label Generic Pharmaceuticals over time. There are no assurances this will occur.
  
 Various publicly available sources indicate that the worldwide sales of generic pharmaceuticals are approximately $200 billion per year. In the United States and Canada, the sales of generic pharmaceuticals are approximately $50 billion and $5 billion, respectively. The generic pharmaceuticals business is fairly competitive and there are several multinational players in the field including Teva (Israel), Novartis - Sandoz (Switzerland), Hospira (USA), Mylan (Netherlands), Sanofi (France), Fresenius Kabi (Germany) and Apotex (Canada). While no assurances can be provided, with our offering of Canadian approved products we believe that we will be able to access at least a small percentage of the generic pharmaceuticals marketplace.
  
 As part of a subscription agreement entered into in 2016, we have an obligation to pay a royalty of 5% of net sales on one of our generic products (Anastrozole) for a period of three (3) years from the date of the first sale of that product. As of the date of this Report we have not yet commenced marketing efforts and no sales or royalty payments have been made.
  
 While no assurances can be provided and subject to the availability of adequate financing, of which there is no assurance, we anticipate that profits from the sales of Generic Products will be used to finance our proprietary drug development program, including Adva-27a, our flagship anticancer compound. In addition to near-term revenue generation, building the generics business infrastructure and securing the proper permits will render us appropriately positioned for the marketing and distribution of our proprietary Adva-27a drug candidate, provided that Adva-27a is approved for such marketing and distribution, of which there can be no assurance.

  Subsequent Event -- Analytical Chemistry Services Operations
  
 On January 1, 2018, we entered into an agreement (the “Atlas Agreement”) to acquire Atlas Pharma Inc. (“Atlas”), . The purchase price was $848,000 Canadian (approximately $678,400 US). Payment of the purchase price was comprised of (i) a cash payment of $100,500 Canadian (approximately $80,400 US); (ii) the issuance of 20,000,000 shares of our Common Stock, and (iii) a promissory note in the principal amount of $450,000 Canadian (approximately $360,000 US), with interest payable at the rate of 3% per annum. We are required to make payments of $10,000 Canadian (approximately $8,000 US) per calendar quarter, due and payable on or before the end of each such calendar quarter through December 31, 2023.
  
 Atlas is a certified company dedicated to chemical analysis of pharmaceutical and other industrial samples. Atlas Pharma has 9 full-time employees and generated revenues of approximately $500,000 Canadian (approximately $400,000 US) in 2017. Housed in a 5,250 square foot facility, Atlas’s operations are authorized by a Drug Establishment License (DEL) issued by Health Canada and are fully compliant with the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Atlas is also registered with the FDA.
  
 We intend to expand Atlas’ business operations by purchasing additional equipment and hiring more technical and sales personnel. Part of the expansion will include the development and addition of new tests and new sample testing capabilities.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
 Effective October 8, 2015, we executed a Patent Purchase Agreement (the “October Purchase Agreement”), with Advanomics, a related party, pursuant to which we acquired all of the right, title and interest in and to U.S. Patent Number 8,236,935 (the “US Patent”) for our anticancer compound, Adva-27a.  On December 28, 2015, we executed a second Patent Purchase Agreement (the “December Purchase Agreement”), with Advanomics, pursuant to which we acquired all of the right, title and interest in and to all of the remaining worldwide rights covered by issued and pending patents under PCT/FR2007/000697 and PCT/CA2014/000029 (the “Worldwide Patents”) for our anticancer compound, Adva-27a.
  
 Effective December 28, 2015, we entered into amendments (the “Amendments”) of these Purchase Agreements pursuant to which the total purchase price was reduced from $17,142,499 to $618,810, the book value of this intellectual property on the financial statements of Advanomics.  Further, the Amendments provided for automatic conversion of the promissory notes representing the new purchase price into an aggregate of 321,305,415 shares of our Common Stock once we increase our authorized capital such that these shares can be issued.  In July 2016 we increased our authorized capital and issued the 321,305,415 Common shares to Advanomics thereby completing all aspects of the patent purchase arrangements and securing direct ownership of all worldwide patents and rights pertaining to Adva-27a.
  
 In addition, in 2016 we signed Cross Referencing Agreements with a major pharmaceutical company for four (4) prescription generic drugs for the treatment of Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer and Enlarged Prostate. These agreements give us the right to register the four (4) generic products, Anastrozole, Letrozole, Bicalutamide and Finasteride in Canada under our own label and obtain a DIN for each in order to be able to place them on the market.
  
 Our new wholly owned subsidiary, Atlas Pharma Inc., which we acquired on January 1, 2018 holds a Drug Establishment License from Health Canada and is registered with the FDA. Atlas Pharma Inc. is the owner of a relatively large portfolio of analytical chemistry methodology and Standard Operating Procedure. This intellectual property is protected as company secrets and controlled through employee and management confidentiality agreements.
  
  Government Regulations
  
 All of our business operations, including the Generic Pharmaceutical Operations, the Proprietary Drug Development Operations, and our newly acquired Analytical Chemistry Services Operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations.
  
 In the U.S, the Federal Government agency responsible for regulating drugs is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The Canadian counterpart to the FDA is the Health Products and Food Branch (“HPFB”) of Health Canada. Both the FDA and HPFB have similar requirements for a drug to be approved for marketing. In addition, the quality standards for brand name drugs and generic drugs are the same. The ingredients, manufacturing processes and facilities for all drugs must meet the guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”). Moreover, all drug manufacturers must perform a series of tests, both during and after production, to show that every drug batch made meets the regulatory agency’s requirements for that product.

In connection with our development of the new chemical entity, Adva-27a, we will be subject to significant regulations in the U.S. in order to obtain the approval of the FDA to offer our product on the market.  The approximate procedure for obtaining FDA approval involves an initial filing of an IND application following which the FDA would review the application and if all the data are in order and acceptable would give the go ahead for the drug sponsor to proceed with Phase I clinical (human) trials.  Following completion of Phase I, the results are filed with the FDA and a request is made to proceed to Phase II.  Similarly, following completion of Phase II the data are filed with the FDA and a request is made to proceed to Phase III.  Following completion of Phase III, a request is made for marketing approval.  Depending on various issues and considerations, the FDA could provide limited marketing approval on a humanitarian basis if the drug treats terminally ill patients with limited treatment options available.  As of the date of this Report we have not made any filings with the FDA or other regulatory bodies in other jurisdictions.  We have however had extensive discussions with clinicians at the McGill University’s Jewish General Hospital in Montreal where we plan to undertake our Phase I study for pancreatic cancer and multidrug resistant breast cancer they believe that Health Canada is likely to grant us a so-called fast-track process on the basis of the terminal nature of the cancer types which we will be treating.  There are no assurances this will occur.
  
  Employees
  
 As of the date of this Report we have three (3) employees, our management.  In addition, our new wholly owned subsidiary acquired on January 1, 2018, Atlas Pharma Inc., has 9 full-time employees. We anticipate that if we receive financing we will need additional employees in both our generic pharmaceutical and proprietary drug development operations including accounting, regulatory affairs, marketing, sales and laboratory personnel.
 Competition
  
 In the area of proprietary anticancer drug development, we will be competing with large publicly and privately held companies engaged in developing new cancer therapies. There are numerous other entities engaged in this business that have greater resources, both financial and otherwise, than the resources presently available to us.  Nearly all major pharmaceutical companies including Amgen, Roche, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Novartis, to name just a few, have on-going anti-cancer drug development programs and some of the drug they may develop could be in direct competition with our drug.  Also, a number of small companies are also working in the area of cancer and could develop drugs that may be in competition with ours.  However, none of these competitor companies can use molecules similar to ours as they would be infringing our patents.
  
 The generic pharmaceuticals business is fairly competitive and there are many players in the field including several multinationals such as Teva (Israel), Novartis - Sandoz (Switzerland), Hospira (USA), Mylan (Netherlands), Sanofi (France), Fresenius Kabi (Germany) and Apotex (Canada)with annual sales in the range of approximately $2 billion to over $10. With our offering of Canadian approved generic products, we believe that we will be able to access at least a small percentage of the generic pharmaceuticals market.
  
  Trademarks-Tradenames
  
 We are the exclusive owner of all worldwide rights pertaining to Adva-27a covered by PCT/FR2007/000697 and PCT/CA2014/000029.  The patent applications filed under PCT/FR2007/000697 have been issued in Europe, Canada, the United States (8,236,935) and elsewhere around the world.  The patent applications recently filed internationally under PCT/CA2014/000029 are still pending.
  
 We are also the owner of Cross Referencing Agreements for four (4) generic drugs which we will market and sell under the tradenames SBI-Anastrozole, SBI-Letrozole, SBI-Bicalutamide and SBI-Finasteride.
