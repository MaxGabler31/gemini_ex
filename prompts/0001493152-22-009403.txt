Developing & Bringing Plant-Based Wellness & Pharma Products to Market
 
We are developing plant-based solutions which include products for improving quality of life and complementary solutions for balancing selected side effects caused by using medicines, cannabis, treatments, or an unbalanced lifestyle. In December 2021 we finalized the development of 25 proprietary formulations in multiple form factors under the brand name of Green Side by Side™ for the wellness industry.
 
The Green Side by Side™ product line includes herbals medicinal mushrooms, vitamins, minerals, and a variety of researched plants known for their healing qualities that contain substances with different anti-inflammatory properties and a variety of health-supportive effects that are relaxing, sleep enhancing, energizing, mood and body balancing, as well as enhancing oral care, alleviating side effects, and many botanical formulations that we target for balancing selected side effects and improving quality of life.
 
Green Side by Side products are manufactured in Israel in a GMP-certified manufacturing facility approved by the Israeli Ministry of Health. In Q1 2022 we launched in the Israeli market several products from the Green Side by Side™ product line, which includes the SmokLy TM series, a line of sprays for the oral cavity to support people suffering from cavity dryness (xerostomia) as a side effect.
 
We have commercially started marketing the products with a local Israeli partner that is targeting medical cannabis distribution channels and we plan to expand our activity in the Israeli market as well as distribute worldwide with local partners and according to local regulations. Green Side by Side is positioned to capture market share in the nutritional supplements market that is expected to reach $625 billion by 20304.

IP and Research & Development Strategy 
 
Our IP strategy and R&D roadmap include building our patent portfolio, conducting clinical studies, advancing products through regulatory approvals. Leveraging technology and research, we continue to innovate, developing solutions that combine botanical formulations, herbal extracts, tinctures, sprays and other natural delivery methods with a variety of researched plants known for their healing qualities.
 
We target to bring to the wellness and pharma market innovative products to improve quality of life and complementary solutions for balancing selected side effects caused by medicines, treatments, cannabis, aging, stress, or an unbalanced lifestyle.
 
Our mission includes developing plant-based medicines for the plant-derived drug market that is expected to reach $53 billion by 20265.
 
Side Effects Caused by Medicines, Cannabis and Treatments, or an Unbalanced Lifestyle
 
A broad range of medicines, including use of cannabis, and treatments have common side effects such as dryness in the oral cavity (xerostomia), headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, lack of concentration, and impaired appetite. We are researching and developing complementary solutions to address the need to balance selected effects through wellness solutions, as well as clinically developed plant-based pharmaceutical solutions6.
 
Addressing a significant market need, we filed a provisional patent application with the US Patent and Trademark Office to address the side effects of cannabis use titled “Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods for the Treatment of Side-Effects Associated with the Use of Cannabis, Cannabinoids and Related Products” patent No: 63/257,673.
 
Research shows that nearly 70% of cannabis users experience constant dry mouth and 20% percent of the elderly suffer from xerostomia as a side effect of their medications7. As part of our Green Side by Side product line, we developed the SmokLy TM  series of sprays for the oral cavity which contain plant extracts distilled from seeds, roots, bark, fruits with active anti-inflammatory substances that encourage saliva production and taste in the oral cavity and can balance the dry mouth side effect (xerostomia) from using medicines and cannabis. We are working diligently on developing a broad array of plant-based wellness and pharma complementary solutions to address selected side effects caused by medicines, cannabis, treatments or an unbalanced lifestyle.
 
Green Vision Center Production & Innovation Center for Plant-Based Wellness & Pharma Products
 
The Green Vision Center is part of our strategy to create end-to-end plant-based solutions covering all the infrastructure, facilities, and activities required for developing, manufacturing, and bringing to market innovative plant-based wellness and pharma products.
 
In February of 2022, we completed the acquisition of 125,000 sq ft (11,687 sq meters) of industrial land in Yerucham, a city in southern Israel, to build the Green Vision Center Israel with the Israeli government support. Approximately 90% of the acquisition cost was provided by Israeli government programs that encourage industrial development and includes additional grants and tax incentives.
 
Designed by Avner Sher, one of Israel’s most highly regarded architects and artists, Green Vision Center will be a 60,000 sq ft (5,500 sq meter) first-of-its-kind facility. The center will be constructed by a professional project construction company that will oversee the  aspects of the building including interfacing with sub-contractors and obtaining the requisite building permits and other required authorizations.
 
As demand for plant-based products in industries ranging from wellness, to pharma, to cosmetics, to food continues to increase, our Green Vision Center will provide highly sought-after facilities for the development and production of botanical and plant-based products.

Acquisition of Land for the building the Green Vision Center Israel
 
We previously disclosed that the Israeli Ministry of the Economy recommended that the Company’s majority-owned subsidiary, Cannovation Center Israel, be granted the right to purchase an industrial parcel of land from the Israel Land Authority (“ILA”) at a subsidized price and exempt from a tender procedures typically required under Israeli law. On February 8, 2022, Cannovation Ltd. received from ILA a counter-signed development agreement (the “Development Agreement”) to purchase rights for long term lease to 11,687 square meters of industrial land in Yeruham in Southern Israel (the “Land”) for purposes of building the Cannovation Center, which is intended to include factories, laboratories, logistics and a distribution center for the wellness, pharma, medical cannabis and botanicals industries. During December 2021, Cannovation Ltd. remitted to the Israeli Ministry of the Economy and the ILA the aggregate amount of 687,650 NIS ($221,122 on the date of payment) to obtain the rights to the Land. The amount represents approximately 10% of the prevailing market price for comparable land space in the general area and is part of the grant by the Israeli government under government programs to encourage industrial development in Southern Israel. The amount remitted represents the total amount that Cannovation Ltd. is required to pay as the purchase price for the Land.

Under the Development Agreement, Cannovation Ltd. will build and develop the Green Vision Center in accordance with by the time frames, terms and conditions of the Agreement. Typically, the initial time frame for completing the development is four (4) years, subject to extensions that the ILA may approve. Upon completion of the development within the time frames and other requirements specified in the Development Agreement, then Cannovation Ltd. will be entitled subject to Israeli law to long term lease agreement (49 years) to the land (equivalent to ownership rights as most of the land in Israel is government owned and when marketed usually the developers are granted with development/long lease rights).
 
Our subsidiary Cannovation Ltd., holds title to the land under the Development Agreement. Under local law in Israel, there are restrictions relating to the transfer of ownership of the premises on the land to a non-Israeli parties, as well as restrictions on the composition of each of Cannovation’s shareholders to ensure that Israeli citizens control each such shareholder. Accordingly, the shareholders of Cannovation, which include our 60% owned subsidiary CTGL Israel, entered into an agreement under which they undertook that at all times they will comply with applicable law in this regard.
 
Cannovation Ltd. is developing its Green Vision Center as development and production of wellness & pharma plant-based products, including botanical solutions, nutritional supplements, vitamins, healthy snacks & beverages, natural cosmetics, medical cannabis & cannabinoid-based products, plant-based pharma products and botanical drugs, and it is planned to include manufacturing plants, laboratories, logistics, import and export, offices, training, conference center, and an international visitor complex.
 
On February 7, 2022, the board of directors of Cannovation Ltd. authorized management of Cannovation Ltd. to finalize the terms of an agreement with one of the leading real estate project construction companies in Israel to commence building the Green Vision Center.

We created multi-strategy solutions to realize our mission, the highlights of which include the following:



1. | Developing & Bringing Plant-Based Wellness & Pharma Products to Market: 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe the power of plant-based solutions from nature can help improve people’s health and quality of life. We have built a strategy for developing a plant-based product portfolio with scientific and research-based plants such as herbal extracts, medicinal mushrooms, and other natural ingredients for the wellness industry and pharma solutions with the mission of developing plant-based medicines.
 
The plant-based products market is booming with health-conscious consumers spending more on natural products, ranging from nutraceuticals, natural superfoods, beverages, cosmetics, to legal cannabis and the evolving market of botanical and plant-derived drugs. The COVID-19 pandemic has left a lasting impression on consumer behavior, particularly in relation to plant-based nutrition and natural immunity boosters11.
 
Here are the various growing plant-based product market segments:
 

● | The nutritional supplements market is expected to reach USD 624.7 billion by 203012. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The superfoods market is expected to reach USD 287.7 billion by 202713. 
● | The legal cannabis market is expected to reach USD 70.6 billion by 202814. 
● | The botanical and plant-derived drug market is expected to reach USD 53 billion by 202615. 
● | The natural cosmetics market is expected to reach USD 20.8 billion by 202716. 

 
We are basing our efforts on technologies to create research and innovation, developing plant based solutions which include products for improving quality of life and complementary solutions for balancing selected side effects caused by using medicines, cannabis, treatments, or an unbalanced lifestyle.
 
About Side Effects Caused by Using Medicines Cannabis and Treatments or an Unbalanced Lifestyle
 
Side effects are unexpected reactions which may result from using medicines and treatments. There are common side effects, such as dryness in the oral cavity (xerostomia), headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, lack of concentration, and impaired appetite that are associated with the use of medicines, treatments and the use of cannabis and related products17.
 
Natural plant-based products show great promise in improving quality of life and can be used as complementary products to balance side effects. Antibiotics and probiotics are an excellent use case. Antibiotics are important for treating bacterial infections; however, they can sometimes cause side effects such as diarrhea, liver disease and changes to the gut microbiota. Using probiotics during and after a treatment with antibiotics can help reduce the risk of diarrhea and restore the gut microbiota to a healthy state18.
 
Addressing a significant market need, we included in our product roadmap is the development of plant based complementary solutions through wellness as well as clinically developed plant-based pharmaceutical products to address the need to balance selected effects and support people who experience side effects from using medicines, cannabis, and various treatments such as:
 
About Xerostomia Dry-Mouth-Side-Effect
 
Research has shown that nearly 70% of cannabis users experienced constant dry mouth and 20% of the elderly population suffer from xerostomia as a side effect of medications19.

We researched the oral cavity dryness side effect, xerostomia, a common side effect associated with damage to the glands responsible to produce saliva that may result from smoking, using cannabis, medications, and treatments. Saliva contains calcium and phosphorous which protects teeth, helps the digestive system, prevents bad smell through balancing the acidity that comes from food and bacteria, has enzymes that help break down food, washes food scraps and bacteria, and helps speech as pronunciation of movements and syllables is done with saliva and tongue. It is important to maintain the saliva level in the mouth and prevent problems and damage, as saliva plays a key role in maintaining health in the oral cavity.
 
Following investigation of dry mouth side effect (xerostomia), And as part of our Green Side by Side line, we developed the SmokLy TM series of sprays for the oral cavity which contain plant extracts distilled from seeds, roots, bark, fruits with active anti-inflammatory substances that encourage saliva production and taste in the oral cavity and can balance the dry mouth side effect (xerostomia) from using medicines and cannabis.

In every jurisdiction in which we plan to operate, we will be subject to extensive governmental regulations on the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, promoting, importing, distributing, shipping, and selling our products, may they be nutritional supplements, cosmetics, foods, or any other category.
 
Prior to commencing operations and/or permitting sales of our products in the market, we may be required to obtain an approval, license, or certification from the relevant country’s ministry of health or another responsible agency. Prior to entering a new market, we plan to work with local authorities, either directly or via our local partner, to obtain the requisite approvals. The approval process usually requires us to present each product and product ingredients and, in some cases, arrange for testing of products by local technicians for ingredient analysis
 
We are aware that we or our local partners would need to obtain various regulatory approvals and licenses for our different product lines and activities, including production of botanicals, nutritional supplements, natural snacks and beverages, natural cosmetics, and more. We intend to obtain all regulatory approvals required for different product categories in the different countries in which we will operate either directly or through our local partners.
 
We describe in this section mainly the material regulations that are currently applicable to our products.
 
Regulatory Environment for the Green Side by Side Products
 
While the number of people using nutritional supplements and herbal medicine products continues to increase in many countries, the regulations for these products vary from country-to-country. In some countries supplement use is limited to general health and well-being while in other countries they are permitted for use as medicinal products. To date, there is little consensus from country to country on the scope, requirements, definition, or even the terminology in which the nutritional supplement and herbal medicines categories could be classified.28
 
Our Green Side by Side products are regulated in Israel as nutritional supplements and meet all regulatory compliance requirements for nutritional supplements in Israel. iBOT Israel Botanicals, our manufacturing facility for the Green Side by Side product line, is approved by the Israeli Ministry of Health and is GMP-certified.
 
The Green Side by Side products will have all relevant regulatory approvals before being launched in other territories, such as European countries and the US.

The Health & Wellness Industries Market Size and Potential:
 
We believe the health & wellness industries, which demonstrate high growth potential, and we are primarily focused on these industries.
 
The global health and wellness market is expected to reach USD 7.6 trillion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.5% from 2021 to 2030. The hectic, unbalanced lifestyle has resulted in the prevalence of lack of proper diet and sleep, stress, depression, anxiety, cancer, diabetes, and various other health related issues. Lack of proper diet has resulted in the reduced intake of essential nutrients and minerals required for the healthy and active functioning of the human body. Precedence research identifies growth opportunities to the health and wellness market players across the globe in the adoption of smart technologies and innovative ways in the manufacturing of various health and wellness products, nutritional supplements, healthy snacks and beverages, the growing biopharmaceutical industry and development of botanical drugs 29.
 
 Health and wellness have been found by Nielsen IQ researchers to be the most powerful consumer force of 2021. In contrast to the unpredictable nature of COVID-19, consumers are being very deliberate with their choices. A survey conducted discovered that consumers emphasize having meaningful and purposeful living, health management, strength and wellness, mental health and stability, happiness, social connections, environmental betterment, balance, and fulfillment. We are witnessing a global movement of health and wellbeing becoming a priority for the public, further emphasized by the recent global COVID-19 pandemic. There is increasing recognition that people need to take charge of their own health, improve their quality of life, use natural products, and balance side effects caused by medicines and treatment30.
 
The Plant-Based Market Size and Potential:
 
The plant-based products market is booming with health-conscious consumers spending more on natural products, ranging from nutraceuticals, natural superfoods, beverages, cosmetics to legal cannabis and the evolving market for botanical and plant-derived drugs. The COVID-19 pandemic has left a lasting impression on consumer behavior, particularly in relation to plant-based nutrition and natural immunity boosters31.

The Global Nutritional Supplements Market
 
The global nutritional supplements market is expected to reach USD 624.7 billion by 2030 and is expanding growth at a CAGR of 7.1% over the forecast period 2021 to 2030 with plant-based supplements containing natural ingredients and extracts of plants and mushrooms that have a beneficial biological effect37. The global superfoods market is expected to reach USD 214.95 billion by 2027 with superfoods being foods that have a very high nutritional density. This means they provide a substantial amount of nutrients and very few calories. They contain a high volume of minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants.
 
Growth in the nutritional supplements is driven by growing awareness of health and safety in the traditional pharma, food, and beverage industries as well as higher healthcare costs. Authentic consumption has become a major food and beverage trend as consumers increasingly seek non-artificial and natural ingredients. Products such as ginseng, echinacea, ginkgo biloba, and garlic, the top selling botanical products are considered natural remedies for inflammation and infections. This is further driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, with consumers looking to strengthen the natural immune system. This is also driving growth of vitamins and minerals and moving towards natural colorant-based plant juice products, since they provide better and long-lasting protection from viruses and bacteria. In addition, botanicals and nutritional supplements are widely used by people who suffer from diseases related to weight management, clinical nutrition, digestive health (gut health problems), immunity, diabetes, and cardio fitness, either as treatment or prevention38.
 
The market demand for Nutritional Supplements is driven by39:
 

● | Increasing attention to health and prevention by the consumers 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Greater customization of needs for different segments of the population 
● | Increased health care costs and search for alternatives to cure specific problems 
● | The growth in demand for supplements is mainly driven by probiotic supplements, Fatty Acids (i.e. fish oils) and protein supplements 
● | Herbal/Botanical Supplements usage has emerged as a popular complementary and alternative medicine or supplement to modern medicine 
● | Rising consumer awareness regarding the severity of digestive disorders, stimulate the growth of the Enzymes segment. 

The Botanical and Plant-derived Drug Market
 
The global botanical and plant-derivative drug market is anticipated to grow to USD 53 billion by 2026 driven by growing applications in diseases, an FDA botanical approval pathway, technological developments in manufacturing processes and a growing focus and demand for naturally sourced medicines40.
 
Botanical drugs are derived from natural sources, plants and mushrooms, and are considered to have fewer side-effects as compared to synthetic drugs while showing high efficacy in helping to treat different medical conditions and chronic diseases41.
 
The important driver for growth in the global botanical and plant-derivative drug market is its growing applications in diseases. Botanical drugs are derivative of medicinal plants and may contain algae and vegetable substances, along with macroscopic fungi. These may assist in the treatment of various diseases, such as central nervous system disorders, infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases. Botanical and plant derivative drugs are available in various forms, such as pills, tablets, and injections42.
 
The factors responsible for limited adoption of botanical drugs are regulations with governments across the globe having strict regulations regarding the use and approval of botanical drugs. The use of botanical and plant derivative drugs is currently limited for curing only a few diseases such as central nervous system disorders and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. We can see some transformation of the regulatory landscape in the US as one of the prime reasons driving the botanical and plant-derived drugs market growth 43.
 
The Botanical and plant-derivative drug market is primarily driven by the following factors 44
 

● | Growing applications in diseases 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------
● | Growing FDA approvals 
● | Technological development in the manufacturing process 
● | Rising demand for traditional medicines 
● | Growing focus on natural source medicines 

The Global Cannabis Market
 
The global legal cannabis market size is expected to reach USD 70.6 billion by 2028 driven mainly by increased legalization of cannabis for medical and adult-use and the growing adoption of these products for the treatment of chronic diseases45.
 
There are currently over 200 million cannabis users worldwide and an increased interest in cannabis as a medicine in recent years46. Cannabis was approved for medical use showing benefit in serious medical conditions including cancer, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s, epilepsy, chronic pain, post trauma, and more. Research indicates that some medical cannabis users experience side effects during their cannabis treatment, which may cause them to discontinue treatment despite good clinical outcomes achieved with the cannabis treatment 47.
 
The Global Natural Cosmetics Market
 
The global natural cosmetics market is projected to reach USD 24.26 billion by 2027 driven mainly by increasing demand for harmful chemical-free cosmetics, rising awareness against the use of animal derivatives and growing social media movements endorsing naturally derived products48.
 
The cosmetic and personal care segment of botanicals is also on the rise with companies increasingly discovering novel herbal ingredients as consumers are seeking more natural products with ingredients that are of plant origin: extracts or oils obtained from raw plant materials. Natural cosmetics are cosmetics that have ingredients of plant origin. The absence of chemical compounds and animal-by products are specifically suited to sensitive skin people. The natural cosmetic products are biodegradable and environmentally friendly. Many companies in the field focus on the production of natural cosmetics that are cruelty-free as these products have increasing demand49.
