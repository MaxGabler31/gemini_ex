Item 1. | Business

Overview
Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc is an international biopharmaceutical company focused on improving patients’ lives by identifying, developing and commercializing meaningful products that address unmet medical needs. 
We have a diverse portfolio of products and product candidates, with a focus in the areas of sleep and hematology/oncology. Our lead marketed products are:

• | Xyrem® (sodium oxybate) oral solution, the only product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of both cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness, or EDS, in patients with narcolepsy;


• | Erwinaze® (asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi), a treatment approved in the U.S. and in certain markets in Europe (where it is marketed as Erwinase®) for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase;


• | Defitelio® (defibrotide sodium), a product approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with hepatic veno-occlusive disease, or VOD, also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, or SOS, with renal or pulmonary dysfunction following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT, and in Europe (where it is marketed as Defitelio® (defibrotide)) for the treatment of severe VOD in adults and children undergoing HSCT therapy; and


• | Vyxeos® (daunorubicin and cytarabine) liposome for injection, a product approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, or t-AML, or acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, with myelodysplasia-related changes, or AML-MRC.

Our strategy is to create shareholder value by:

• | Growing sales of the existing products in our portfolio, including by identifying and investing in growth opportunities such as new treatment indications and new geographic markets;


• | Acquiring or licensing rights to clinically meaningful and differentiated products on the market or product candidates at various stages of development; and


• | Pursuing targeted development of post-discovery differentiated product candidates.

3

We apply a disciplined approach to allocating our resources between investments in our current commercial and development portfolio and acquisitions or in-licensing of new assets.
In 2017, we continued to increase our focus on research and development activities and achieved meaningful milestones in our clinical development of new product candidates, activities related to line extensions and new indications for existing products and the generation of additional clinical data for existing products, all in our sleep and hematology/oncology therapeutic areas.

Our Commercialized Products
Xyrem
Xyrem is the only treatment approved by the FDA and marketed for both EDS and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. Sodium oxybate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in Xyrem, is a formulation of the sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyrate, or GHB, an endogenous neurotransmitter and metabolite of gamma-aminobutyric acid. Xyrem was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy in 2002 and was approved for EDS in patients with narcolepsy in 2005. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommended Xyrem as a standard of care for the treatment of both EDS and cataplexy associated with narcolepsy.

Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder caused by a loss of neurons that produce the neurotransmitter hypocretin (also known as orexin), which is hypothesized to stabilize sleep-wake states. The primary symptoms of narcolepsy include EDS, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnogogic hallucinations and disrupted nighttime sleep. EDS is an essential symptom of narcolepsy, is present in all narcolepsy patients and is characterized by chronic, pervasive sleepiness as well as sudden irresistible and overwhelming urges to sleep (inadvertent naps and sleep attacks). Cataplexy, the sudden loss of muscle tone, can be one of the most debilitating symptoms of narcolepsy. Cataplexy is present in approximately 70% of patients with narcolepsy. Cataplexy can range from slight weakness or a drooping of facial muscles to the complete loss of muscle tone resulting in postural collapse. It may also impair a patient’s vision or speech. Cataplexy is often triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, anger or surprise. Cataplexy can severely impair a patient’s quality of life and ability to function.
Narcolepsy may affect many areas of life, including limiting a patient’s education and employment opportunities and leading to driving or machinery accidents or difficulties at work resulting in disability or job dismissal. Patients with narcolepsy may also suffer from significant medical comorbidities, including depression, suicide risk, anxiety, diseases of the digestive system, respiratory diseases and cardiac disorders.
It is estimated that narcolepsy affected approximately 1 in 2,000 people in the U.S., or approximately 160,000 people, in 2017. We believe that fewer than half of those people have been definitively diagnosed with narcolepsy. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the average number of active Xyrem patients in the U.S. was approximately 13,525 patients, and we believe that there are significantly more narcoleptic patients with cataplexy and/or EDS who might benefit from treatment with Xyrem. In an effort to reach more patients, we continue to implement initiatives such as outreach to prescribers who treat narcolepsy, physician/healthcare provider education, enhanced patient and physician support services and unbranded disease awareness programs for the public.
In 2017, net product sales of Xyrem were $1,186.7 million, which represented 74% of our total net product sales.
Our marketing, sales and distribution of Xyrem are subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, which is required by the FDA to ensure the safe distribution of Xyrem and minimize the risk of misuse, abuse and diversion of sodium oxybate. Under the Xyrem REMS, all of the Xyrem sold in the U.S. must be dispensed and shipped directly to patients through a central pharmacy. Xyrem may not be stocked in retail pharmacies. Physicians and patients must complete an enrollment process prior to fulfillment of Xyrem prescriptions, and each physician and patient receives materials concerning the risks and benefits of Xyrem before the physician can prescribe, or a patient can receive, the product. Whenever a prescription is received by the central pharmacy, the central pharmacy verifies the prescription and must speak with the patient before each prescription of Xyrem is filled and sent to the patient. The central pharmacy ships the product directly to the patient by a courier service, and the patient or his/her designee signs for the package. The initial shipment may include only up to a one-month supply, and refill orders may include only up to a three-month supply.
We have an agreement with Express Scripts Specialty Distribution Services, Inc., or Express Scripts, to exclusively distribute Xyrem in the U.S. and provide patient support services related to Xyrem. Our agreement with Express Scripts, which has been in effect since July 2002, expires on July 1, 2019, subject to a one-year extension at Jazz’s discretion. The agreement may be terminated by either party at any time without cause on 180 days’ prior written notice to the other party. We own all standard operating procedures, business rules and the related intellectual property for the services Express Scripts provides related to patient support programs. The agreement provides for Express Scripts to assist in the orderly transfer of the services that Express Scripts provides to us and the related intellectual property, including intellectual property related to the patient database, to any new pharmacy that we may engage.
Xyrem is currently sold in 21 countries by UCB Pharma Limited, or UCB (which has rights to market Xyrem in 54 countries), and, as of January 1, 2018, we directly market Xyrem in Canada for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. We had previously licensed the Canadian marketing rights to Xyrem to Valeant Canada Limited, or Valeant, and supplied Xyrem to Valeant. 
Nine companies have filed abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Xyrem. We filed patent lawsuits against each of the ANDA filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, or the District Court, asserting that such generic products would violate our patents covering Xyrem. We have settled lawsuits against five of the ANDA filers, including the first filer, Roxane Laboratories, Inc., which was acquired by West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC), or West-Ward. We granted West-Ward the right to sell an authorized generic version of Xyrem, or AG Product, beginning on January 1, 2023, or earlier under certain circumstances, including circumstances related to the licensing or market entry of another generic sodium oxybate product, a final decision that all unexpired claims of the Xyrem patents are invalid and/or unenforceable, or a substantial reduction in Xyrem net sales over specified periods of time. We also granted West-Ward a license to launch its own generic sodium oxybate product as early as six months after it has the right to sell the AG Product, unless it elects to continue to sell the AG Product, which it may do for up to a total of five years. In a separate settlement with Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., or Par, we granted Par the right to sell a limited volume of AG Product beginning on July 1, 2023, or earlier under certain 
5

circumstances, including acceleration of West-Ward’s AG Product launch date. Each of Par and the other three settling filers have been granted a license to launch its own generic sodium oxybate product on or after December 31, 2025, or earlier under certain circumstances, including the launch by West-Ward or another party of a generic sodium oxybate product under its ANDA. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of the ongoing ANDA litigation proceedings against the remaining non-settling ANDA filers. For a description of these and other legal proceedings and settlement agreements related to Xyrem, see “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
In January 2017, the FDA approved West-Ward’s ANDA for a generic sodium oxybate product. The FDA’s letter approving West-Ward’s ANDA notes that, as the first ANDA applicant, West-Ward is eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity. West-Ward’s ANDA approval also includes a waiver that permits West-Ward to use a separate REMS program from the Xyrem REMS on the condition that the REMS approved with West-Ward’s ANDA, or the generic sodium oxybate REMS, be open to all future sponsors of ANDAs or NDAs for sodium oxybate products. The FDA has also tentatively approved two additional ANDAs for generic sodium oxybate products.
The actual timing of any commercial launch of an AG Product or a generic sodium oxybate product is uncertain. We expect that the launch of any generic sodium oxybate product, including any AG Product, or the approval and launch of other products that compete with Xyrem, would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our sales of Xyrem and on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.  For discussion regarding the risks associated with our ANDA settlement agreements, the approval and tentative approval of ANDAs, the potential launch of AG Products or generic versions of Xyrem, or the approval and launch of other sodium oxybate or other products that compete with Xyrem, as well as other risks and challenges we face with respect to Xyrem, see “Business—Government Regulation—The Hatch-Waxman Act” and “Business—Competition” in this Part I, Item 1 and the risk factors under the headings “Risks Related to Xyrem and the Significant Impact of Xyrem Sales,” “We face substantial competition from other companies, including companies with greater resources, including larger sales organizations and more experience working with large and diverse product portfolios, than we have” and “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
Xyrem is a controlled substance in the U.S., subject to regulation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, under the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. Therefore, its manufacturing and distribution are highly restricted. The API for Xyrem is manufactured for us by a single source supplier. The finished product for Xyrem is manufactured both by us in our facility in Athlone, Ireland and by our U.S.-based Xyrem supplier. For more information regarding Xyrem supply, see “Business—Manufacturing” in this Part I, Item 1 and the risk factor under the heading “The loss of our single source suppliers, delays or problems in the supply of our products for commercial sale or our product candidates for use in our clinical trials, or our or our suppliers’ failure to comply with manufacturing regulations, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
Erwinaze
Erwinaze (called Erwinase in markets outside the U.S., and which we refer to in this report as Erwinaze unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires) is a biologic product used in conjunction with chemotherapy to treat patients with ALL who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase. Erwinaze is an asparaginase, a type of enzyme that can deprive leukemic cells of an amino acid essential for their growth. It is derived from a rare bacterium (Erwinia chrysanthemi) and is immunologically distinct from E. coli-derived asparaginase and suitable for patients with hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived treatments. For ALL patients with hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase, Erwinaze can be a crucial component of their therapeutic regimen. 
ALL is the most common childhood cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that between 5,000 to 6,000 new cases of ALL will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2018. Based on data from the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the U.S. Census Bureau available in 2015, we estimate that approximately 50% of ALL patients were diagnosed under age 15 and approximately 20% were diagnosed between 15 and 39 years of age. A study published by Dana Farber Cancer Institute, with median follow-up of 57 months, concluded that the intensive use of high-dose asparaginase has an important role in the treatment of children with ALL. Data reported in two separate papers published in Pediatric Blood & Cancer and Journal of Clinical Oncology, respectively, suggest that up to 20% of ALL patients may develop hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase. Current treatment guidelines and protocols recommend switching a patient receiving E. coli-derived asparaginase to treatment with Erwinaze if the patient’s hypersensitivity reaction to the E. coli-derived asparaginase is Grade 2-4, indicating that the hypersensitivity reaction has resulted in an intervention or interruption in infusion occurring in the patient’s treatment regimen. While pediatric treatment protocols commonly include asparaginase, adult protocols do not. In addition, we believe that Erwinaze has the potential for use in patients with silent hypersensitivity, a situation in which E. coli-derived asparaginase may induce antibodies that can neutralize the enzyme or increase its clearance, thereby depriving patients of its therapeutic benefits without manifesting the clinical symptoms of hypersensitivity. 
Erwinaze was originally developed by Public Health England, a national executive agency of the United Kingdom, or UK. First approved by the FDA under a biologics license application, or BLA, for administration via intramuscular injection in 
6

conjunction with chemotherapy, Erwinaze was launched in the U.S. in November 2011. In December 2014, the FDA approved a supplemental BLA for administration of Erwinaze via intravenous infusion in conjunction with chemotherapy. In Europe and elsewhere around the world, Erwinase is sold pursuant to marketing authorizations, named patient programs, temporary use authorizations or similar authorizations. Erwinaze is exclusively licensed to us for worldwide marketing, sales and distribution by Porton Biopharma Limited, or PBL, a company that is wholly owned by the UK Secretary of State for Health. PBL also manufactures the product for us and is our sole supplier for Erwinaze. We are obligated to make tiered royalty payments to PBL based on worldwide net sales of Erwinaze. Our license and manufacturing agreement with PBL expires in December 2020, subject to automatic five-year extensions unless terminated by either party in writing by December 2018. We cannot predict whether the term of the agreement will be extended or, if extended, the terms of any such extension.
Erwinaze has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA for the treatment of ALL in the U.S. until November 2018, and we believe that it is protected by exclusivity that prevents approval of a biosimilar in the U.S. through late 2023 under the U.S. Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA. 
In 2017, net product sales of Erwinaze were $197.3 million, which represented 12% of our total net product sales.
Defitelio
Defibrotide, the API in Defitelio, is the sodium salt of a complex mixture of single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from porcine DNA. In in vitro studies, defibrotide has shown a number of pharmacological effects that suggest it has a role in both protection of the endothelial cells that form the inner lining of blood vessels and restoration of the balance between clot formation and breakdown in the blood.
Defibrotide has been developed for the treatment and prevention of VOD, a potentially life-threatening complication of HSCT. Stem cell transplantation is a frequently used treatment modality for hematologic cancers and other conditions in both adults and children. Certain conditioning regimens used as part of HSCT can damage the cells that line the hepatic vessels, which is thought to lead to the development of VOD, also referred to as SOS, a blockage of the small vessels in the liver, that can lead to liver failure and potentially result in significant dysfunction in other organs such as the kidneys and lungs. Severe VOD is the most extreme form of VOD and is associated with multi-organ failure and high rates of morbidity and mortality. An analysis of retrospective data, prospective cohort studies and clinical trials published between 1979 and 2007 found that the 100-day mortality rate in severe VOD cases is greater than 80%. Based on data from published surveys and our market research, we estimate that, in Europe, approximately 35,600 patients will undergo HSCT in 2018, approximately 5,300 will be considered at high risk for the development of VOD, and the incidence of VOD will be approximately 2,800 patients; in the U.S., we estimate that approximately 21,600 patients will undergo HSCT in 2018, approximately 3,400 will be considered at high risk for the development of VOD, and the incidence of VOD will be approximately 1,000 to 2,000 patients. Our review of relevant literature and market research also suggests that about one-third to two-thirds of VOD patients may be eligible for treatment using defibrotide.
In October 2013, the European Commission, or EC, granted marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances for Defitelio for the treatment of severe VOD in adults and children undergoing HSCT. Defitelio is also the only approved treatment for this potentially life-threatening condition in the European Union, or EU. We launched Defitelio in certain European countries beginning in 2014 and continue to launch the product in additional European countries on a rolling basis. In those European markets where Defitelio is approved but not yet launched, our medical science liaisons and medical directors respond to medical information requests regarding defibrotide and provide information consistent with local treatment protocols. We intend to eventually commercialize Defitelio in all European markets where it has marketing authorization. We also continue to provide patients access to defibrotide where it is not commercially available outside the U.S. on a named patient basis. 
In August 2014, we acquired from Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Sigma-Tau, the rights to defibrotide for the treatment and prevention of VOD in North America, Central America and South America. In exchange for the rights to defibrotide in the Americas, we made an upfront payment of $75.0 million to Sigma-Tau and also made milestone payments of $175.0 million comprised of (i) $25.0 million upon the acceptance for filing by the FDA of the first NDA for defibrotide for VOD, paid in the fourth quarter of 2015; and (ii) an additional $150.0 million upon FDA approval of defibrotide for VOD, paid in the second quarter of 2016.
In March 2016, the FDA approved our NDA for Defitelio for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with VOD with renal or pulmonary dysfunction following HSCT. We launched Defitelio in the U.S. shortly after FDA approval. In July 2017, we obtained regulatory approval of defibrotide in Canada, and we launched the product in Canada in the third quarter of 2017. 
Defibrotide has been granted orphan drug designation by the EC and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to treat and prevent VOD. The Commonwealth of Australia-Department of Health has granted defibrotide orphan drug designation for the treatment of VOD. In addition, the EC granted orphan drug designation to defibrotide for the prevention of aGvHD, another potentially fatal complication of HSCT that afflicts up to 50% of all donor transplant patients. We are also 
7

developing defibrotide for other potential indications. For more information regarding defibrotide development activities, see “Business—Research and Development” in this Part I, Item 1. 
In 2017, Defitelio/defibrotide product sales were $133.7 million, which represented 8% of our total net product sales.
Vyxeos
Vyxeos is a liposome formulation of a fixed combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine for intravenous infusion that is indicated for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC and has been shown to have synergistic effects at killing leukemia cells in vitro and in animal models. Vyxeos is the first injectable fixed ratio, drug delivery combination oncology product based on our CombiPlex technology platform approved by the FDA.
AML is a rapidly progressing and life-threatening blood cancer that begins in the bone marrow, which produces most of the body's new blood cells.  AML cells crowd out healthy cells and move aggressively into the bloodstream to spread cancer to other parts of the body.  AML is a relatively rare disease representing 1.3% of all new cancer cases. The American Cancer Society has estimated that more than 20,000 people would be diagnosed with AML in the U.S. and nearly 11,000 people would die from the disease in the U.S. in 2018. The median age at diagnosis is 68 years old, with rising age associated with a progressively worsening prognosis.  There is also a reduced tolerance for intensive chemotherapy as patients age.  AML has the lowest survival rate of any form of leukemia. Patients with newly diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC may have a particularly poor prognosis.  
In August 2017, the FDA approved our NDA for Vyxeos for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC. We launched and began shipping Vyxeos in the U.S. in August 2017. We submitted an MAA for Vyxeos to the EMA in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the treatment of t-AML or AML-MRC.  
Vyxeos has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA until August 2024 for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC and has received orphan drug designation by the EC for the treatment of AML. For more information regarding our CombiPlex technology platform and Vyxeos development, see “Business—Research and Development” in this Part I, Item 1. 
In 2017, Vyxeos product sales were $33.8 million, which represented 2.1% of our total net product sales. 
Prialt and other products
We commercialize Prialt, an intrathecally administered infusion of ziconotide, approved by the FDA in December 2004 for the management of severe chronic pain in patients for whom intrathecal therapy is warranted, and who are intolerant of or refractory to other treatment, such as systemic analgesics, adjunctive therapies or intrathecal morphine. Intrathecal therapy is the delivery of the drug into the intrathecal space in the spine through an infusion system comprised of a programmable infusion pump and catheter. For most patients who achieve good pain relief and tolerability with Prialt, pain relief can be maintained over time without cumulative toxicity. Prialt is the only FDA-approved non-opioid intrathecal analgesic. We have worldwide rights to Prialt, excluding certain countries outside of the U.S. licensed by Eisai Co. Limited, or Eisai, from Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (subsequently acquired by Perrigo Company plc) in May 2010. We sell the product in the U.S., and we supply Prialt to Eisai, which sells the product in certain countries outside of the U.S. 
We also sell psychiatry and other products in the U.S.
Research and Development
Our development projects currently include clinical development of new product candidates, activities related to line extensions for existing products and the generation of additional clinical data for existing products in our sleep and hematology/oncology therapeutic areas.
In the sleep therapeutic area, we have the following ongoing and planned development activities:

• | Solriamfetol (JZP-110)

Phase 3 Clinical Trials and NDA Submission.  Solriamfetol is a late-stage investigational compound being developed for potential treatment of ES in patients with narcolepsy and ES in patients with OSA. We acquired worldwide development, manufacturing and commercial rights to solriamfetol from Aerial BioPharma LLC, or Aerial, in January 2014, other than in certain jurisdictions in Asia where SK Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd, or SK, retains rights. We conducted two Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with ES associated with OSA and one Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with ES associated with narcolepsy. In the second quarter of 2017, we presented positive efficacy results along with safety results from our two Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with ES associated with OSA and one Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with ES associated with narcolepsy. In addition, we enrolled approximately 640 patients from our Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials in an ongoing open label extension trial evaluating the long-term safety and 
8

maintenance of efficacy of solriamfetol, and we have completed the interim data analysis in this trial. We submitted an NDA to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 to seek approval for solriamfetol in the treatment of ES associated with OSA and ES associated with narcolepsy. In the event our NDA is approved, we expect that solriamfetol will be subject to scheduling by the DEA, which will need to be completed after approval of our NDA, but before it can be commercially launched. We are preparing to submit an MAA to the EMA for solriamfetol in late 2018. 
Phase 2 Clinical Trial.  We commenced patient enrollment in a Phase 2 clinical trial of solriamfetol in patients with ES associated with Parkinson’s disease in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2017 and are targeting completion of enrollment in late 2018. We expect to enroll approximately 50 adult patients in this trial. There are no FDA-approved therapies for ES in Parkinson’s disease in the U.S.
Other Activities.  We are also evaluating future pipeline expansion opportunities for solriamfetol in other disorders and conditions, as well as opportunities for geographic expansion.

• | Xyrem

Phase 3 Clinical Trial of Xyrem in Children and Adolescents. While in many patients narcolepsy can begin during childhood and adolescence, there has been limited information on the treatment of pediatric narcolepsy patients with Xyrem. We worked with the FDA and several leading specialists to design a clinical trial to generate additional data on the treatment of pediatric narcolepsy patients with Xyrem. We conducted a Phase 3 clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of Xyrem in children and adolescents aged seven to 17 who have narcolepsy with cataplexy. In the second quarter of 2017, we presented positive efficacy results along with the safety results from this trial. We anticipate submitting an sNDA and pediatric written request report to the FDA in mid-2018. 

• | JZP-507

JZP-507 is an investigational new drug candidate with a 50% reduction in sodium content compared to Xyrem that in a pilot study has demonstrated bioequivalence to Xyrem. We are investigating JZP-507 for the potential treatment of both narcolepsy with cataplexy and EDS in narcolepsy. We expect to be ready to submit an NDA to the FDA as early as mid-2018. We believe that JZP-507 would offer a clinically meaningful benefit to patients compared to Xyrem. 

• | JZP-258

Phase 3 Clinical Trial in Narcolepsy. JZP-258 is an investigational new drug candidate that contains 90% less sodium than Xyrem and is being developed for the potential treatment of both narcolepsy with cataplexy and EDS in narcolepsy. We believe that JZP-258 would offer a clinically meaningful benefit to patients compared to Xyrem. We enrolled the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial of JZP-258 in the EU and U.S. in the first quarter of 2017 and expect to complete enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2018. Subject to the results of this trial, we anticipate submitting an NDA to the FDA in 2019.
Planned Phase 3 Clinical Trial in IH. IH is a chronic, neurological disorder that is primarily characterized by EDS. There are no FDA-approved therapies for IH in the U.S. We expect to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate JZP-258 in the treatment of IH in the second half of 2018. 
Other Activities. We are also pursuing activities related to the potential development of once-nightly dosing options for narcolepsy patients that we believe would provide clinically meaningful improvements to patients compared to Xyrem. We are exploring formulation options, including an evaluation of deuterated oxybate.
In the hematology and oncology therapeutic area, we have the following ongoing and planned development activities:

• | Vyxeos

MAA Submission. We submitted an MAA for Vyxeos to the EMA in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the treatment of t-AML or AML-MRC. The EMA granted accelerated assessment of the MAA for Vyxeos; accelerated assessment is granted for products expected to be of major interest for public health and can potentially shorten the duration of the EMA’s review by up to six months. Vyxeos has received orphan drug designation by the EC for the treatment of AML. 
Planned Phase 2 Cooperative Group MDS Clinical Trial.  Myelodysplasia syndromes are hematopoietic stem cell disorders that are characterized by blood cell dysplasias and ineffective hematopoiesis. For most patients, MDS will lead to progressive marrow failure with profound cytopenias. In some patients, MDS will evolve into AML. We are preparing for a Phase 2 clinical trial with a cooperative group to evaluate Vyxeos in the treatment of MDS, with planned initiation in the second half of 2018. 
Other Activities. We are also assessing the potential for approval of Vyxeos in other countries and for development of Vyxeos in additional indications.

• | Defibrotide

Phase 3 Clinical Trial. In the first quarter of 2017, we enrolled the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial of defibrotide to evaluate the safety and efficacy of defibrotide for the prevention of VOD in high-risk and very high-risk patients following HSCT. We expect to enroll approximately 400 patients in this global trial and, depending on the results from the interim analysis, the enrollment could increase to up to approximately 600 patients.
Phase 2 aGvHD Clinical Trial. We enrolled the first patient in a Phase 2 proof of concept trial to evaluate defibrotide for the prevention of aGvHD following HSCT in the first quarter of 2018. 
Planned Pivotal Phase 2 TA-TMA Clinical Trial. We expect to activate sites in a pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate defibrotide in the treatment of TA-TMA in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Other Activities.  We are also evaluating the potential of defibrotide in additional post-HSCT complications, as well as its potential utility in other serious, life-threatening conditions. 

• | Asparaginase Programs. We are pursuing activities related to the development of improved products, including recombinant crisantaspase, for patients with ALL or other hematological malignancies. 


• | CombiPlex. CombiPlex is a technology platform that enables the design and rapid evaluation of various combinations of therapies to deliver enhanced anti-cancer activity. CombiPlex seeks to identify the most synergistic ratio of drugs in vitro and fix this ratio in a nano-scale delivery complex that maintains the synergistic combination after administration. CombiPlex utilizes two proprietary nano-scale delivery platforms: liposomes to control the release and distribution of water-soluble drugs and drugs that are both water- and fat-soluble (amphipathic), and nanoparticles to control the release and distribution of non-water-soluble (hydrophobic) drugs. We are evaluating the use of CombiPlex in a number of therapeutic combinations in oncology. 

We have also entered into in a number of licensing and collaboration agreements, including:

• | ImmunoGen. In August 2017, we entered into a collaboration and option agreement with ImmunoGen, Inc., or ImmunoGen, granting us rights to opt into exclusive, worldwide licenses to develop and commercialize two early-stage, hematology-related antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, programs, IMGN779 and IMGN632, as well as an additional ADC program to be designated during the term of the agreement. IMGN779 is a CD33-targeted ADC that ImmunoGen is investigating for the treatment of AML, and IMGN632 is a CD123-targeted ADC that ImmunoGen is investigating for the treatment of hematological malignancies, including AML and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. Both IMGN779 and IMGN632 are in Phase 1 testing. 


• | Pfenex. In July 2016, we entered into an agreement with Pfenex, Inc., or Pfenex, granting us worldwide rights to develop and commercialize multiple early-stage hematology product candidates and an option for us to negotiate a license for a recombinant pegaspargase product candidate. This agreement was amended in December 2017. 


• | XL-protein. In May 2017, we entered into a license agreement with XL-protein GmbH, or XLp, for the rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize products using XLp’s PASylation® technology to extend the plasma half-life of selected asparaginase product candidates. 

We recorded research and development expenses of $198.4 million, $162.3 million and $135.3 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also recorded charges of $85.0 million, $23.8 million and $0.0 million to in-process research and development in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Sales and Marketing
We have commercial operations primarily in the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., our products are marketed through our commercial teams, including approximately 160 trained, experienced sales professionals who promote Xyrem, Erwinaze, Defitelio, Vyxeos and Prialt directly to physicians in specialties appropriate for each product. We also provide reimbursement support for all of our U.S. products.
Outside of the U.S., our hematology and oncology sales force has approximately 25 hematology field specialists responsible for promoting Erwinase and Defitelio in approved markets where we commercialize these products. In those markets where Erwinase and Defitelio are not currently approved, approximately 24 medical science liaisons and nine medical directors are responsible for responding to medical information requests and for providing information consistent with local treatment protocols. We also utilize distributors in certain markets outside the U.S. where we do not market our products directly, as further described in “Business—Customers and Information About Geographic Areas” in this Part I, Item 1.
10

Our commercial activities include marketing-related services, distribution services and commercial support services. We employ third party vendors, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and suppliers of marketing and other sales support-related services, to assist with our commercial activities. 
We have a relatively small number of sales representatives compared with the number of sales representatives of most other pharmaceutical companies with marketed products. We believe that the size of our sales force is appropriate to effectively reach our target audience for our marketed products in the specialty markets in which we currently operate. We promote Defitelio, Erwinaze and Vyxeos to many hematology and oncology specialists who operate in the same hospitals, and we believe that we benefit from operational synergies from this overlap. Continued growth of our current marketed products and the launch of any future products, including Vyxeos in Europe and solriamfetol, may require further expansion of our sales force and sales support organization in the U.S. and internationally. 
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and dominated by a number of large, established pharmaceutical companies, as well as specialty pharmaceutical companies that market products and develop product candidates in sleep, hematology/oncology, pain and other therapeutic areas. Many of these companies, particularly large pharmaceutical and life sciences companies, have substantially greater financial, operational and human resources than we do. They can spend more on, and have more expertise in, research and development, regulatory, manufacturing, distribution and sales activities. As a result, our competitors may obtain regulatory approvals for their product candidates more rapidly than we may and may market their products more effectively than we do. Smaller or earlier stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
Our ability to continue to grow requires that we compete successfully with other pharmaceutical companies for product and product candidate acquisition and in-licensing opportunities. These competitors include other specialty pharmaceutical companies and established companies that may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size and financial resources.
We also face competition, and may in the future face additional competition, from manufacturers of generic drugs. Certain U.S. state laws allow for, and in some instances in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician mandate, the dispensing of generic products rather than branded products where a generic version is available. Generic competition often results in decreases in the prices at which branded products can be sold, particularly when there is more than one generic available in the marketplace. Other companies could also develop products that are similar, but not identical, to our marketed products, such as an alternative formulation or an alternative delivery technology, and seek approval in the U.S. through a Section 505(b)(2) NDA approval pathway that allows companies to seek approval of a product that is similar, but not identical, to a previously-approved brand-name product, and rely to some degree on the previously-approved product’s safety and efficacy data.
Our products and product candidates may also compete in the future with new products currently under development by others. Any products that we develop are likely to be in a highly competitive market, and many of our competitors may succeed in developing products that may render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. In particular, certain of our products and product candidates face or may face competition as described below:

• | Xyrem. While Xyrem is the only product approved by the FDA and currently marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of both cataplexy and EDS in patients with narcolepsy, nine companies have filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Xyrem, the FDA has approved or tentatively approved three ANDAs and we believe that it is likely that the FDA will approve or tentatively approve additional ANDAs. We settled ANDA patent lawsuits against five ANDA filers and, in connection with those settlement agreements, we granted each of the settling filers rights to sell an AG Product and/or its own generic sodium oxybate product as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have ongoing patent lawsuits against the remaining ANDA filers and cannot predict the specific timing or outcome of events with respect to those and other proceedings with such filers or whether there will be additional ANDA filers. Accordingly, the actual timing of any commercial launch of an AG Product or a generic sodium oxybate product is uncertain. 

In addition to generic competition, other companies could develop and launch sodium oxybate or other products that are similar, but not identical, to Xyrem, such as an alternative formulation or a different delivery technology, and seek approval in the U.S. by referencing Xyrem and relying, to some degree, on the FDA’s approval of Xyrem and related determinations of safety and efficacy. For example, Avadel Pharmaceuticals plc, or Avadel, a company that is using its proprietary technology for delivery of a sodium oxybate formulation to eliminate second nighttime dosing for narcolepsy patients, has stated that it is conducting a Phase 3 pivotal trial pursuant to an FDA-approved special protocol assessment, and has indicated that it intends to seek approval of its product candidate using a Section 505(b)(2) NDA approval pathway referencing Xyrem. We are also aware of products being developed by others for use as 
11

treatment options in cataplexy and/or EDS in patients with narcolepsy that have different safety profiles and mechanisms of action than Xyrem, including a product to treat adult patients with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy that received marketing approval in Europe in 2016. While this product is currently not approved by the FDA for marketing in the U.S., the company that has exclusive U.S. commercialization rights to this product has announced that it expects to establish an expanded access program for the product in early 2018 and to submit an NDA to the FDA for the treatment of narcolepsy in adult patients during the first half of 2018. The receipt of marketing approval and commercialization of this product, Avadel’s product or other products that may be approved in the U.S. for the treatment of narcolepsy patients could, depending on the targeted patient population, reduce Xyrem sales, which could have the additional effect of potentially triggering acceleration of market entry of AG Products or other generic sodium oxybate products under our ANDA litigation settlement agreements, as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
As alternatives to Xyrem, cataplexy is often treated with tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, or selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs, even though these products are not approved by the FDA for the treatment of cataplexy. Tricyclic antidepressants are a class of antidepressant drugs first used in the 1950s. The use of these drugs can often result in somnolence, which exacerbates the EDS already experienced by all patients with narcolepsy. SSRIs and SNRIs are compounds typically used for the treatment of clinical depression. Somnolence and insomnia are commonly reported side effects of SSRIs, while loss of sleep is a commonly reported side effect of SNRIs. These side effects may be problematic for patients with narcolepsy.
The only other products both approved by the FDA and currently marketed for the treatment of EDS in patients with narcolepsy are Provigil® (modafinil) and Nuvigil® (armodafinil), which are marketed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited, or Teva, and generic versions of Provigil. Provigil, its generic equivalents and Nuvigil are also approved for improving wakefulness in patients with EDS associated with treated OSA or shift work disorder. Xyrem is often used in conjunction with stimulants and wakefulness promoting agents, including Provigil, its generic equivalents and Nuvigil, which are administered during the day.
For further discussion regarding legal proceedings related to Xyrem, the risks associated with our ANDA settlement agreements, the approval and tentative approval of ANDAs, the potential launch of AG Products or generic versions of Xyrem, or the approval and launch of other sodium oxybate or other products that compete with Xyrem, as well as other risks and challenges we face with respect to Xyrem, see “Business—Government Regulation—The Hatch-Waxman Act” in this Part I, Item 1, the risk factors under the heading “Risks Related to Xyrem and the Significant Impact of Xyrem Sales,” Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” and the risk factor under the heading “We face substantial competition from other companies, including companies with greater resources, including larger sales organizations and more experience working with large and diverse product portfolios, than we have” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K and “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.

• | Erwinaze. Erwinaze is a biologic product used in conjunction with chemotherapy and is indicated for patients with ALL who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase. While there is currently no direct competition to Erwinaze to treat ALL patients with hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase, other companies have developed or are developing new treatments for ALL, including new asparaginase treatments that could reduce the rate of hypersensitivity in patients with ALL, and new treatment protocols are being developed for ALL that may not include asparaginase-containing regimens. For example, a number of companies are developing new immunotherapy treatments for relapsed or refractory ALL patients, including one treatment that was recently approved. The development of these new treatments could negatively impact our ability to grow sales of Erwinaze in patient populations where the benefit of an asparaginase-containing regimen is not well established. As a biologic product, Erwinaze also faces potential competition from biosimilar products. 


• | Defitelio. Defitelio is the only approved treatment in the U.S. for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with VOD, also known as SOS, with renal or pulmonary dysfunction following HSCT and the only approved treatment in the EU for severe VOD in adults and children undergoing HSCT. Various anti-clotting strategies have been tried by researchers in patients with VOD with mixed results, including Activase (alteplase), a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator marketed by Genentech, Inc., generic heparin sodium injection and Thrombate III (antithrombin III (human)), marketed by Grifols Therapeutics, Inc. While there is currently no direct competition to Defitelio to treat severe VOD, changes in the types of conditioning regimens used as part of HSCT may affect the incidence rate of VOD and demand for Defitelio. 


• | Vyxeos. AML, the cancer indication for which we commercialize Vyxeos, has alternative established therapies. A key consideration in the treatment of AML patients is the patient’s suitability for chemotherapy. The patient population studied in the Vyxeos Phase 3 clinical trial included AML patients deemed able to tolerate chemotherapy. The existing options for the treatment of newly-diagnosed t-AML patients who can tolerate chemotherapy include 

12

cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline (i.e., daunorubicin), known as 7+3.  In addition, we are aware of several other products that have been recently approved by the FDA or are in development for use as treatment options for AML patients, such as targeted agents (FLT-3, IDH-1, IDH-2, CD-33, CAR T‑cell). Some of the patient populations being studied for these products in development overlap with the patient population studied in the Vyxeos Phase 3 clinical trial. The existence of established treatment options and the development of competing products for the treatment of newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC could negatively impact our ability to successfully commercialize Vyxeos and achieve the level of sales we expect. 

• | Solriamfetol. With respect to solriamfetol, other treatments for ES in patients with narcolepsy include stimulants and wake-promoting agents, such as Provigil and Nuvigil, and generic versions of stimulants and wake-promoting agents. We are also aware of off-label uses of stimulants for ES in patients with OSA. Solriamfetol, if approved by the FDA, will likely face competition from this genericized market. In addition, we are aware of several other products in development for use as potential treatment options for ES in patients with narcolepsy or OSA, including, for example, pitolisant, mazindol, modafinil combinations and Avadel’s once-nightly sodium oxybate formulation. 

For more information on the competitive risks we face generally, see the risk factor under the heading “We face substantial competition from other companies, including companies with greater resources, including larger sales organizations and more experience working with large and diverse product portfolios, than we have” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Customers and Information About Geographic Areas 
In the U.S., our lead marketed product, Xyrem, is sold to one specialty pharmacy, Express Scripts, which ships Xyrem directly to patients. Erwinaze, Defitelio and Vyxeos are sold to hospitals through a specialty distributor, McKesson Corporation. Prialt is sold in the U.S. through an exclusive pharmacy to other pharmacies and medical facilities, and our other products are sold in the U.S. primarily to distributors who distribute the product to pharmacies and hospitals. We have distribution services agreements made in the ordinary course of business with these distributors, which include prompt payment discounts and various standard service fees or rebate arrangements. Purchases are made on a purchase order basis.
Outside of the U.S., we distribute Erwinase through Durbin PLC, a UK-based wholesaler and distributor, to hospitals and local wholesalers in Europe where we market Erwinase directly and, in markets where we do not market Erwinase directly, to local distributors and wholesalers in Europe and elsewhere in the world. We distribute Defitelio in European countries where the product has been launched commercially primarily through IDIS Limited, or IDIS, a UK-based distributor. We also work with IDIS and a number of local distributors in Europe and elsewhere in the world to distribute defibrotide on a named patient basis.  Xyrem is currently sold in 21 countries by UCB (which has rights to market Xyrem in 54 countries), and, as of January 1, 2018, we directly market Xyrem in Canada for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. We had previously licensed the Canadian marketing rights to Xyrem to Valeant and supplied Xyrem to Valeant. 
Eisai has rights to market Prialt in numerous countries outside of the U.S. While we retain the rights to Prialt in the remaining non-U.S. territories, we are not currently selling the product outside of the U.S.
Information on our total revenues by product, attributed to U.S. and non-U.S. sources and attributed to customers who represented at least 10% of our total revenues in each of 2017, 2016 and 2015, as well as the location of our long-lived assets, is included in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We are headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. We also have offices in Palo Alto, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Ewing, New Jersey; Vancouver, British Columbia; Oxford, United Kingdom; Lyon, France; Villa Guardia (Como), Italy; Athlone, Ireland; and elsewhere in Europe. For a discussion of risks related to our operations, see the risk factors under the headings “Risks Related to Our Business,” “Risks Related to Our Industry” and “Risks Related to Our Financial Condition and Results” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Manufacturing 
We received FDA approval of our manufacturing and development facility in Athlone, Ireland in June 2016, and we commenced commercial operations at this facility in the third quarter of 2016. We are using this facility for the manufacture of Xyrem and development-stage product candidates, including JZP-507 and JZP-258, and we expect to manufacture these products commercially at our Athlone facility should these candidates receive regulatory approval. However, other than our Athlone facility and our manufacturing plant in Italy where we produce the defibrotide drug substance, we currently do not have our own commercial manufacturing capability for our products, product candidates, or their APIs, or packaging capability. 
13

As a result, our ability to develop and supply products in a timely and competitive manner depends primarily on third party suppliers, in most cases single source suppliers, being able to meet our ongoing commercial and clinical trial needs. 
Lead Marketed Products
Xyrem. In 2010, we entered into an agreement with Siegfried (USA) Inc., subsequently renamed Siegfried USA, LLC, or Siegfried, for the supply of sodium oxybate, the API of Xyrem. Siegfried supplies sodium oxybate to our U.S.-based manufacturer of Xyrem and, through a Siegfried affiliate in Europe, to our Athlone facility. Although Siegfried has been our only supplier of sodium oxybate since 2012, we have the right to purchase a portion of our worldwide requirements of sodium oxybate from other suppliers. Under our agreement, we provide periodic rolling forecasts to Siegfried, and a portion of each rolling forecast constitutes a firm purchase order. The agreement with Siegfried expires in April 2021, subject to automatic three-year extensions until either party provides notice to the other of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 18 months before the end of the then-current term. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency. During the term of the agreement and, under certain circumstances for 18 months after the agreement terminates, Siegfried is not permitted to manufacture sodium oxybate for any other company.
Effective October 1, 2015, we entered into a Master Manufacturing Services Agreement, or the Master Agreement, with Patheon Pharmaceuticals Inc., which we refer to together with its affiliates as Patheon. The Master Agreement establishes the general terms and conditions pursuant to which Patheon will provide manufacturing services for drug products, including Xyrem, as specified by us in product agreements entered into from time to time. Although we have commenced manufacturing of Xyrem in our Athlone facility, we expect to rely on Patheon as our U.S.-based supplier of Xyrem for the foreseeable future. However, we are not required to purchase Xyrem exclusively from Patheon. The Master Agreement expires on December 31, 2020 and may be extended for additional two-year terms if Patheon is then providing manufacturing services for any product, unless either party provides 18 months prior notice of termination. In addition, we may terminate the Master Agreement for any reason upon 12 months’ prior written notice, and either party has the right to terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. 
Quotas from the DEA are required in order to manufacture and package sodium oxybate and Xyrem in the U.S. For information related to DEA quota requirements, see “Business—Government Regulation—Other Regulatory Requirements—Controlled Substance Regulations” in this Part I, Item 1.
Erwinaze. Erwinaze is exclusively licensed to us, and manufactured for us, by PBL, a company that is wholly owned by the UK Secretary of State for Health, which is our sole supplier for Erwinaze. Our license and manufacturing agreement with PBL expires in December 2020, subject to automatic five-year extensions unless terminated by either party in writing by December 2018. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency. We provide periodic rolling forecasts to PBL, and a portion of each rolling forecast constitutes a firm purchase order. The Erwinaze BLA includes a number of post-marketing commitments related to the manufacture of Erwinaze by PBL. 
In January 2017, the FDA issued a warning letter to PBL indicating that it was not satisfied with PBL’s responses to the FDA Form 483 issued to PBL in March 2016 and citing significant violations of current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, for finished pharmaceuticals and significant deviations from cGMP for APIs. In March 2017, PBL filed a response to the warning letter with the FDA. PBL continues to address the issues identified by the FDA in the warning letter. In the UK, where PBL’s manufacturing facilities are located, PBL is subject to similar inspections conducted by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA. Following a site inspection of PBL by MHRA in December 2017, MHRA issued an inspection report listing several major findings, including major deficiencies and failures by PBL to comply with cGMP. In January 2018, PBL filed a response to the report with the MHRA. We cannot predict if or when PBL will correct the violations and deviations to the satisfaction of the FDA and MHRA or whether the FDA and MHRA will be satisfied with PBL’s responses. Any failure by PBL to respond to the satisfaction of the FDA and MHRA could result in enforcement actions by the FDA or MHRA, including the FDA refusing admission of Erwinaze into the U.S.
Moreover, the current manufacturing capacity for Erwinaze is completely absorbed by demand for the product. We are working with PBL to address the production delays and quality challenges, and related regulatory scrutiny. As a consequence of constrained manufacturing capacity, we have had an extremely limited or no ability to build product inventory levels that can be used to absorb supply disruptions resulting from quality, regulatory or other issues. We have experienced product quality, manufacturing and inventory challenges that have resulted, and may continue to result from time to time, in disruptions in our ability to supply certain markets and have caused, and may in the future cause, us to implement batch-specific, modified product use instructions. Most recently, we have been experiencing temporary supply disruptions in the first quarter of 2018 in the U.S. and other countries. We cannot predict whether the required remediation activities in connection with the January 2017 FDA warning letter or the December 2017 MHRA report will further strain manufacturing capacity and adversely affect Erwinaze supply, particularly in light of our extremely limited product inventory. As capacity constraints and supply disruptions continue, whether as a result of continued quality, manufacturing or regulatory issues or otherwise, we will be 
14

unable to build a desired excess level of product inventory, our ability to supply the market may continue to be compromised and physicians’ decisions to use Erwinaze have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted. 
If quality, manufacturing or regulatory issues persist and result in a disruption to supply or capacity constraints, under our agreement with PBL, we do not have the right to engage a backup supplier for Erwinaze except in very limited circumstances, such as following the termination of the agreement by us due to the uncured material breach or the cessation of manufacturing by our supplier. If we are required to engage a backup or alternative supplier, the transfer of technical expertise and manufacturing process to the backup or alternative supplier would be difficult, costly and time-consuming, might not be successful and would increase the likelihood of a delay or disruption in manufacturing or a shortage of supply of Erwinaze. If we fail to obtain a sufficient supply of Erwinaze, our sales of and revenues from Erwinaze, our future maintenance and potential growth of the market for this product, and/or our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.
Defitelio/defibrotide. We are our sole supplier of, and we believe that we are currently the sole worldwide producer of, the defibrotide drug compound. We manufacture the defibrotide compound in a single facility located in Villa Guardia, near Como, Italy. Patheon currently processes the defibrotide compound into its finished vial form under a specific product agreement entered into under an agreement with Patheon. Patheon is the sole provider of our commercial and clinical supply of Defitelio; however, we are not required to purchase Defitelio exclusively from Patheon. If Patheon does not or is not able to supply us with Defitelio for any reason, it may take time and resources to implement and execute the necessary technology transfer to another processor, and such delay could negatively impact our anticipated revenues from Defitelio and could potentially cause us to breach contractual obligations with customers or to violate local laws requiring us to deliver the product to those in need.
Vyxeos. Vyxeos is manufactured using our CombiPlex technology platform, which we acquired through the acquisition of Celator Pharmaceuticals, Inc. CombiPlex products represent formulations with increased manufacturing complexities associated with producing drug delivery vehicles encapsulating two or more drugs that are maintained at a fixed ratio and, in the case of Vyxeos, two drugs that are co-encapsulated in a freeze-dried format. Vyxeos is manufactured by Baxter Oncology GmbH, or Baxter, which is a sole source supplier from a single site location. Our manufacturing agreement with Baxter expires in August 2022, subject to automatic three-year renewal terms, unless terminated by either party 24 months’ prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal term. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement for breach, subject to customary cure periods, and either party may terminate the agreement immediately in the event of the other party’s insolvency. While other contract manufacturers may be able to produce Vyxeos, the proprietary technology that supports the manufacture of Vyxeos is not easily transferable. 
Product Candidates 
Siegfried has supplied us with both the API and finished product for our development activities involving solriamfetol, including our Phase 3 clinical trials. We expect that Siegfried will manufacture and supply solriamfetol drug product for commercial sale if solriamfetol receives regulatory approval and that, in the short term, Siegfried will be the sole provider of our commercial supply of solriamfetol. We also expect that solriamfetol will be subject to scheduling by the DEA, which will need to be completed after NDA approval, and depending on DEA’s scheduling classification, we may be required to obtain a DEA quota for Siegfried to manufacture solriamfetol. For information related to DEA quota requirements, see “Business—Government Regulation—Other Regulatory Requirements—Controlled Substance Regulations” in this Part I, Item 1. If Siegfried does not or is not able to supply us with solriamfetol for any reason, including due to a failure to obtain any necessary DEA quotas, it may take time and resources to implement and execute the necessary technology transfer to another provider, and such delay could negatively impact our anticipated revenues from an approved solriamfetol product.
JZP-507 and JZP-258 are currently manufactured at our Athlone facility, and we expect to manufacture these products commercially at our Athlone facility should these candidates proceed through development and receive regulatory approval.  Certain of our other product candidates and their APIs are supplied to us by third party contract manufacturers. 
For further discussion of the challenges we face with respect to supply of our products and product candidates, see the risk factor under the heading “The loss of our single source suppliers, delays or problems in the supply of our products for commercial sale or our product candidates for use in our clinical trials, or our or our suppliers’ failure to comply with manufacturing regulations, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.

Patents and Proprietary Rights 
We actively seek to patent, or to acquire or obtain licenses to third party patents, to protect our products and related inventions and improvements that we consider important to our business. We own a portfolio of U.S and non-U.S. patents and patent applications and have licensed rights to a number of issued patents and patent applications. Our owned and licensed patents and patent applications cover or relate to our products and product candidates, including certain formulations, uses to treat particular conditions, distribution methods and methods of administration, drug delivery technologies and delivery profiles and methods of production. Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The patent laws of non-U.S. countries differ from those in U.S., and the degree of protection afforded by non-U.S. patents may be different from the protection offered by U.S. patents.
The patents and patent applications that relate to our lead marketed products and product candidates include:

• | Xyrem. We have 22 patents in the U.S. relating to Xyrem that expire at various times from December 2019 to March 2033, of which 18 are listed in the FDA’s publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” or the Orange Book. These patents relate to Xyrem’s stable and microbially resistant formulation, its manufacturing process, its method of use, including its restricted distribution system, and its method of administration. Of the patents listed in the Orange Book, five are formulation patents expiring between December 2019 and July 2020; seven are associated with the Xyrem REMS, expiring between December 2022 and June 2024; three are method of use patents covering Xyrem’s use in narcolepsy, which expire in December 2019; and three are method of administration patents relating to a drug-drug interaction, or DDI, between Xyrem and divalproex sodium expiring in March 2033. Four patents are not listed in the Orange Book but also relate to Xyrem: two for methods for making the formulation expiring December 2019, one for a distribution system expiring June 2024 and one for method of administration expiring March 2033. We have received a pediatric written request from the FDA, and we intend to submit the results of a pediatric clinical study in response to this request. If the FDA determines that the submission meets the terms and conditions of the written request, then six months of pediatric exclusivity will be added to the term of each patent listed for Xyrem in the Orange Book. A Xyrem formulation patent has issued in multiple non-U.S. countries and will expire in December 2019. In November 2017, the European Patent Office issued a patent related to the method of administration of Xyrem relating to the DDI between Xyrem and divalproex sodium, expiring in February 2034. In addition to our issued patents, we have patent applications relating to Xyrem pending in the U.S. and other countries. 

Nine companies have filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Xyrem. We filed patent lawsuits against each of the ANDA filers in the District Court asserting that such generic products would violate our patents covering Xyrem. We have settled lawsuits against five of the ANDA filers. Certain ANDA filers filed petitions for inter partes review, or IPR, by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or the PTAB, of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, with respect to the validity of certain distribution, method of use and formulation patents covering Xyrem. The PTAB instituted IPR trials with respect to certain of these petitions. In July 2016 and March 2017, the PTAB issued final decisions that the claims of six patents and three claims in a seventh patent associated with the Xyrem REMS are unpatentable. Those PTAB decisions are part of a consolidated appeal currently pending before the United States Court of Appeal for the Federal Circuit, or Federal Circuit. If the Federal Circuit upholds the PTAB decisions on appeal, we will not be able to enforce claims the PTAB found unpatentable. For further description of these legal proceedings, see “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
In September 2016, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, submitted a Citizen Petition to the FDA requesting that, for safety reasons, the FDA refuse to approve any sodium oxybate ANDA with a proposed package insert or REMS that omits the portions of the Xyrem package insert and the Xyrem REMS that instruct prescribers on adjusting the dose of the product when it is co-administered with divalproex sodium (also known as valproate or valproic acid). In January 2017, the FDA granted the Citizen Petition with respect to the Xyrem package insert, concluding that it will not approve any sodium oxybate ANDA referencing Xyrem that does not include in its package insert the portions of the currently approved Xyrem package insert related to the DDI with divalproex sodium. Our Xyrem DDI patents cover these instructions on the Xyrem package insert and Xyrem REMS. We cannot predict whether one or more of the non-settling ANDA filers, or a company that files a Section 505(b)(2) application for a drug referencing Xyrem, may pursue regulatory strategies to avoid infringing our method of administration patents notwithstanding the FDA’s response to the Citizen Petition, or whether any such strategy would be successful. Likewise, we cannot predict whether we will be able to maintain the validity of any of our patents or will otherwise obtain a judicial determination that a generic or other sodium oxybate product, its package insert or the generic sodium oxybate REMS or another separate REMS will infringe any of our patents or, if we prevail in proving infringement, whether a court will grant an injunction that prevents any non-settling ANDA filer or 
16

other company introducing a different sodium oxybate product from marketing its product, or instead require that party to pay damages in the form of lost profits or a reasonable royalty. 
For a description of the foregoing matters, see “Business-Government Regulation-The Hatch-Waxman Act” in this Part I, Item 1, the risk factors under the headings “Risks Related to Xyrem and the Significant Impact of Xyrem Sales” and “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

• | Erwinaze. Erwinaze has no patent protection. It was granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA for the treatment of ALL in the U.S. until November 2018, and we believe that it is protected by exclusivity that prevents approval of a biosimilar in the U.S. through late 2023 under the BPCIA. For more details, see “Business—Government Regulation—Orphan Drug and Other Exclusivities” in this Part I, Item 1. 


• | Defitelio. The unique process of deriving defibrotide from porcine DNA is extensive and uses both chemical and biological processes that rely on complex characterization methods. We have a portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications relating to various compositions, methods of use and methods of characterization, some of which have expired and others will expire at various times between now and June 2035. None of these patents are listed in the Orange Book. Defibrotide has been granted orphan drug designation by the EC and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to treat and prevent VOD. The Commonwealth of Australia-Department of Health has granted defibrotide orphan drug designation for the treatment of VOD. In addition, the EC has granted orphan drug designation to defibrotide for the prevention of aGvHD. 


• | Vyxeos. We have a portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications for Vyxeos and the CombiPlex technology platform relating to various compositions and methods of use. These include three U.S. patents expiring between April 2025 and April 2029 and two U.S. patents covering CombiPlex expiring in January 2027, subject to any patent term extensions. Vyxeos has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA until August 2024, seven years from its FDA approval, for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC. In addition, Vyxeos has been granted orphan drug designation by the EC for the treatment of AML. 


• | Solriamfetol. We acquired rights to solriamfetol from Aerial in January 2014, including Aerial’s patent rights relating to solriamfetol, other than in certain jurisdictions in Asia where SK retains rights. We have a portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications for solriamfetol relating to various compositions and methods of use. Three U.S. method of use patents covering treatment of sleep-related conditions will expire between June 2026 and August 2027, subject to any patent term extension. 


• | JZP-507 and JZP-258. Certain patents and patent applications relating to Xyrem cover JZP-507 and JZP-258. In addition, JZP-507 and JZP-258 are claimed in formulation patents that will expire in January 2033. 

We also rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information, to protect our products and commercial position, particularly with respect to our products with limited or no patent protection, such as Erwinaze. We seek to protect our trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and partners. Nevertheless, our employees, consultants, advisors and partners may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors, and we may not have adequate remedies for such disclosures. In addition, if our employees, consultants, advisors or partners develop inventions or processes independently, or jointly with us, that may be applicable to our products, disputes may arise about ownership or proprietary rights to those inventions and processes. Such inventions and processes will not necessarily become our property but may remain the property of those third parties or their employers. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained, or is using any of our inventions or trade secrets is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside of the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.
For further discussion of the challenges we face in obtaining or maintaining patent and/or trade secret protection, see the risk factors under the heading “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
In addition, we have a number of trademarks and service marks, and pending trademark and service mark applications, in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world to further protect the proprietary position of our products.
Government Regulation
The manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, record keeping, importing and exporting of our products and our research and development activities are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, the EC, the competent authorities of the EU member states and other regulatory authorities. 
17

Regulations differ from country to country. As a result of these regulations, product development, approval and commercialization processes are expensive and time-consuming.
Approval of Pharmaceutical Products
We are not permitted to market a pharmaceutical product in the U.S. or in the EU member states until we receive approval from the FDA, the EC or the competent authorities of the EU member states, as applicable. An application for marketing approval must contain information demonstrating the quality, safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product.
United States
In the U.S., the FDA regulates the review, approval, manufacturing and marketing of our products. The steps required before a drug or biologic may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally include: 

• | preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence;


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic for each indication, as further described below;


• | the submission to the FDA of the NDA or BLA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is made, analyzed and stored to assess compliance with cGMP;


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the application; and


• | FDA review and approval of the application.

Human clinical trials conducted before approval of a product for a specific indication generally proceed in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into human subjects, the drug is typically tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions and side effects associated with increasing doses. Phase 2 usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a drug demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients. In addition, Phase 4, or post-approval, clinical trials may be required by the FDA and are used to gain additional safety data or to document a clinical benefit in the case of products approved under Accelerated Approval regulations. 
Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with general investigational plans and protocols, as well as the FDA’s requirements, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. The FDA enforces good clinical practices through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. 
To obtain FDA approval of a product candidate, an applicant, also called a sponsor, must submit certain data and information in the form of an NDA or BLA, as applicable, and generally pay a user fee. The FDA performs an initial review of a submitted NDA or BLA before it accepts it for filing and may refuse to file an application and/or request additional information before acceptance. Once an NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the application. Under the current goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for a new molecular entity, the FDA has ten months from the filing decision in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and eight months for a priority application for a new molecular entity. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and in certain circumstances, the PDUFA goal date may be extended.
If the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks, a sponsor may be required to include a proposed REMS (as part of the application or after approval), which may include a patient package insert or a medication guide to provide information to consumers about the product’s risks and benefits; a plan for communication to healthcare providers; and restrictions on the product’s distribution referred to as elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. Xyrem is required to have a REMS. See the discussion regarding REMS under “Business—Government Regulation—The Hatch-Waxman Act” below and in the risk factors under the headings “The distribution and sale of Xyrem are subject to significant regulatory oversight and restrictions and the requirements of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, and these restrictions and requirements, as well as the potential impact of changes to these restrictions and requirements, subject us to increased risks and uncertainties, any of which could negatively impact sales of Xyrem” and “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
During the review of a marketing application, the FDA also evaluates any manufacturing and nonclinical and clinical trial facilities for the proposed product. When the FDA’s evaluation is complete, it issues an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed 
18

to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the application, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA may also refer an application to the appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee. 
The FDA has and has used various programs, including Fast Track, Priority Review, Breakthrough Therapy and Accelerated Approval (Subpart H and E), that are intended to expedite the process for reviewing certain applications and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints or restricted distribution. Generally, drugs and biologics may be eligible for one or more of these programs if they are intended for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, have potential to address unmet medical needs, or may provide meaningful benefit over existing treatments.
Europe and Rest of World
Outside of the U.S., our ability to market a medicinal product generally depends upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authority. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, obtaining marketing authorization, fulfillment of pharmacovigilance obligations, obtaining pricing and reimbursement and related matters vary widely from country to country. In any country, however, we will generally be permitted to commercialize our products if the appropriate regulatory authority is satisfied that we have presented adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy and grants a related authorization. The time needed to secure approval for medicinal products may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
In the EU, marketing authorization for medicinal products can be obtained through several different procedures. These are through a centralized, mutual recognition procedure, decentralized procedure, or national procedure (single EU member state). The centralized procedure allows a company to submit a single application to the EMA. Based on a positive opinion of the EMA, the EC will grant a centralized marketing authorization that is valid in all EU member states and three of the four European Free Trade Association, or EFTA, countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products and biologic products, and optional for certain other products. The decentralized procedure allows companies to file identical applications for authorization to several EU member states simultaneously for medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU member state. The competent authority of one EU member state, selected by the applicant, assesses the application for marketing authorization. The competent authorities of the other EU member states are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territories on the basis of this assessment except where grounds of potential serious risk to public health require this authorization to be refused. The mutual recognition procedure allows companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one EU member state to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU member states. 
The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days, subject to certain exceptions. The initial marketing authorization granted in the EU is valid for five years. Once renewed, the authorization is usually valid for an unlimited period unless the national competent authority or the EC decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. The renewal of a marketing authorization is subject to a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of the product by the national competent authorities or the EMA.
In addition, products may be granted marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances in the EU if an applicant can demonstrate that comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety of the product under normal conditions of use cannot be provided due to certain specified objective and verifiable reasons. A marketing authorization granted under exceptional circumstances is valid for five years, subject to an annual reassessment of conditions imposed by the competent authorities. In October 2013, the EC granted marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances for Defitelio for the treatment of severe VOD in adults and children undergoing HSCT.
The making available or placing on the EU market of unauthorized medicinal products is generally prohibited. However, the competent authorities of the EU member states may exceptionally and temporarily allow the supply of such products, either on a named patient basis or through a compassionate use process, to individual patients or a group of patients with a chronically or seriously debilitating disease or whose disease is considered to be life-threatening, and who cannot be treated satisfactorily by an authorized medicinal product.
Clinical studies must currently be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the EU Clinical Trials Directive and applicable good clinical practice standards. All entities conducting clinical trials in the EU will be required to comply with the requirements of the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, which may enter into force in 2019. The new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, which will replace the EU Clinical Trials Directive, introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU, including a new coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials that is reminiscent of the mutual recognition procedure for marketing authorization of medicinal products, and an increased obligation on sponsors to publish clinical trial results.

The Hatch-Waxman Act
The approval process described above for the U.S. is premised on the applicant being the owner of, or having obtained a right of reference to, all of the data required to prove the safety and effectiveness of a drug product. This type of marketing application, sometimes referred to as a “full” or “stand-alone” NDA, is governed by Section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, which includes the results of preclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product, in addition to other information as described above.
Alternatively, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides two abbreviated approval pathways for drug products that are in some way follow-on versions of products already covered by an approved NDA. The first path, under Section 505(b)(2), is for the approval of a product that is similar, but not identical, to a previously-approved brand-name product, which is referred to as the reference listed drug, or RLD. Under this path, the applicant is permitted to rely to some degree on the FDA’s finding that the RLD is safe and effective and must submit its own product-specific data of safety and effectiveness to the extent necessary because of the differences between the products. The FDA may then approve the new drug product for all or some of the label indications for which the RLD has been approved or for a new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
The second path established under the Hatch-Waxman Act is for the approval of generic drugs. Section 505(j) of the FDCA permits the submission of an ANDA for a generic version of an approved, brand-name drug. Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and the approved RLD (1) have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, (2) are intended for the same uses, and (3) are bioequivalent. This data and information are provided instead of independently demonstrating the proposed generic product’s safety and effectiveness, which are inferred from the fact that the generic product is the same as the RLD the FDA previously found to be safe and effective. 
To the extent that an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is relying on the FDA’s findings for an already-approved product, the applicant is required to certify that there are no patents listed for that product in the Orange Book, or that for each Orange Book-listed patent the listed patent has expired, or will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration, or the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the new product. A certification that approval is sought after patent expiration is called a “Paragraph III Patent Certification.” A certification that the new product will not infringe the RLD’s Orange Book-listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a “Paragraph IV Patent Certification,” or Paragraph IV Certification. If the patent is for an approved method of use, an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) applicant can also file a statement, called a “section viii statement,” that the application does not seek approval of the use covered by the listed patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA or the Section 505(b)(2) NDA will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the RLD have expired, as well as any additional period of exclusivity that might be obtained for completing pediatric studies pursuant to the FDA’s written request. The ANDA or the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may also be subject to delay in review or approval based on applicable non-patent exclusivities, such as exclusivity that results from obtaining approval of a new chemical entity or of a new use of a previously approved active ingredient.
If the applicant has provided a Paragraph IV Certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send a notice of such certification to the holder of the NDA and the relevant patent holders once the ANDA or the Section 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a legal challenge to the proposed generic product for infringing the patent. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of a notice of Paragraph IV Certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or the Section 505(b)(2) NDA until the earliest of 30 months after the NDA holder’s receipt of the notice of Paragraph IV Certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. The 30-month stay period may also be shortened or lengthened upon order of the court in the infringement lawsuit. For drugs with five-year exclusivity, if an action for patent infringement is initiated after year four of that exclusivity period, then the 30-month stay period is extended by such amount of time so that 7.5 years has elapsed since the approval of the NDA for the RLD. This period could be extended by six months if the NDA sponsor obtains pediatric exclusivity. Alternatively, if the listed patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the applicant will not be subject to the 30-month stay. The FDA may issue tentative approval of an ANDA if the generic applicant meets all conditions for approval but cannot receive effective approval because the 30-month stay or another period of regulatory exclusivity, including an exclusivity held by another ANDA filer, has not expired. If an ANDA is approved after the 30-month stay and before conclusion of any relevant patent litigation at the district, and potentially appellate, court, a generic manufacturer could nonetheless choose to commercialize the generic product, also known as a launch “at risk.” In the event of such commercialization, the generic manufacturer generally would be liable for damages if the NDA holder ultimately prevails in the patent litigation.
20

Section 505-1(i)(1) of the FDCA generally provides that (i) an ANDA that references a drug subject to a REMS with ETASU is required to have a REMS with the same elements as the RLD and (ii) the ANDA drug and the RLD shall use a single shared system to assure safe use. However, the FDA may waive this requirement for a single shared system and approve an ANDA with a separate REMS with differing but comparable aspects of ETASU under certain circumstances. 
The FDA approval of the West-Ward ANDA in January 2017 includes a waiver of the shared REMS requirement that permits West-Ward to use a separate REMS program from the Xyrem REMS, or the generic sodium oxybate REMS, on the condition that the generic sodium oxybate REMS be open to all future sponsors of ANDAs or NDAs for sodium oxybate products. This could potentially include future sodium oxybate products approved under Section 505(b)(2). In connection with the waiver, FDA issued a statement that it considers the generic sodium oxybate REMS to have the same ETASU as the Xyrem REMS and operationalizes those elements in a comparable manner to achieve the same level of safety as the Xyrem REMS. 
Specifically, the FDA stated that both the Xyrem REMS and the generic sodium oxybate REMS require that (1) healthcare providers who prescribe the drug be specially certified; (2) the drug be dispensed only by pharmacies that are specially certified; and (3) the drug be dispensed and shipped only to patients who are enrolled in the REMS program with documentation of safe use conditions. However, the FDA stated that the generic sodium oxybate REMS, unlike the Xyrem REMS, permits multiple certified pharmacies and multiple databases that are connected via an electronic “switch” system. The generic sodium oxybate REMS also requires the certified pharmacies in its system to contact the Xyrem REMS program to verify that the patient has no other active prescriptions for Xyrem that overlap with the generic prescription to be filled and to identify any patient and prescriber disenrollments from the Xyrem system for suspected abuse, misuse and diversion. 
We were not involved in development of the generic sodium oxybate REMS and were not consulted regarding any features of this REMS. Our settlement agreements with certain of the ANDA filers do not directly impact the FDA’s waiver of the single shared system REMS requirement, any other ANDA filer’s ability to develop and implement the generic sodium oxybate REMS for its generic sodium oxybate product or our ability to take any action with respect to the generic sodium oxybate REMS. We cannot predict the outcome or impact on our business of any future action that we may take with respect to the FDA’s waiver of the single shared system REMS requirement, its approval and tentative approval of generic versions of Xyrem or the consequences of distribution of sodium oxybate through the generic sodium oxybate REMS approved by the FDA or another separate REMS.  We expect that the launch of any generic sodium oxybate product, including any AG Product, or the approval and launch of other products that compete with Xyrem, would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our sales of Xyrem and on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. For more information, see the risk factors under the headings “Risks Related to Xyrem and the Significant Impact of Xyrem Sales” and “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. 
Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, newly approved drugs and indications may benefit from a statutory period of non-patent marketing exclusivity. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety. The Hatch-Waxman Act prohibits the FDA from accepting for review an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for another version of such drug during the five-year exclusive period; however, as explained above, submission of an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA containing a Paragraph IV Certification is permitted after four years, which may trigger litigation leading to a 30-month stay of approval of the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA that could extend to 7.5 years after approval of the RLD. Protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act will not prevent the submission or approval of another “full” NDA; however, the applicant would be required to conduct its own preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs, including Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, for, among other things, new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug, if new clinical investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are determined by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also permits a patent term extension of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, a patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years after the FDA approves a marketing application. The patent term extension period is generally equal to the sum of one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, and all of the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, up to a total of five years. Only one patent applicable to a product or its use may be extended, and only if the regulatory review leads to the first commercial marketing of that drug, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for patent term extension. We will consider applying for a patent term extension for some of our patents to add patent life beyond the expiration date, if we meet the legal requirements permitting an extension and depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of an NDA.
We intend to vigorously defend any patents for our approved products, including our Orange Book-listed patents. For a further description of these matters, see “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the risk 
21

factors under the headings “Risks Related to Xyrem and the Significant Impact of Xyrem Sales” and “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Orphan Drug and Other Exclusivities
Some jurisdictions, including the U.S., may designate drugs or biologics for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. The FDA grants orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that product. An orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. However, if the FDA grants orphan drug designation for an indication and the product is the first approved for that indication, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication for a period of seven years from the time of FDA approval. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a product that is otherwise the same as one already approved for the same indication if the sponsor can present a plausible hypothesis that its product is clinically superior to the previously approved drug. To be approved with orphan drug exclusivity, however, the sponsor would have to demonstrate that the drug is clinically superior to the previously approved drug. Even if a product is approved with orphan drug exclusivity, competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan product has exclusivity, or approval of the same drug for different indications or uses.
The FDA approved Xyrem as an orphan drug for the treatment of EDS and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy, but the periods of orphan drug exclusivity for Xyrem have expired. In January 2018, Avadel announced that it had obtained an orphan drug designation from the FDA for its once-nightly sodium oxybate formulation for the treatment of narcolepsy. To obtain orphan drug exclusivity, Avadel will have to show actual clinical superiority to Xyrem, or if applicable, to any other oxybate product approved for the treatment of EDS and cataplexy in narcolepsy. If the FDA approves Avadel’s sodium oxybate product for the treatment of EDS and cataplexy in narcolepsy and grants Avadel’s product orphan drug exclusivity, then the FDA cannot approve another oxybate product for the treatment of EDS and cataplexy in narcolepsy during the exclusivity period unless such oxybate product demonstrates clinical superiority to Avadel’s product. 
Erwinaze has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA for the treatment of ALL until November 2018. Defibrotide has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA to treat and prevent VOD until March 2023. Vyxeos has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA for the treatment of AML until August 2024.
Separately, Erwinaze, as a biologic product approved under a BLA, is subject to the BPCIA. The BPCIA authorizes the FDA to license a biological product that is biosimilar to an FDA-licensed biologic, or reference product, through an abbreviated pathway. The BPCIA provides periods of exclusivity that protect a reference product from competition by biosimilars. Under the BPCIA, the FDA may not accept a biosimilar application for review until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and the biosimilar cannot be licensed until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed. We believe that Erwinaze will receive exclusivity that prevents approval of a biosimilar in the U.S. through late 2023 under the BPCIA.
Products also may be eligible for an additional six months of regulatory exclusivity or patent protection if the sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. This effectively extends the period during which, because of regulatory exclusivity or listed patents, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA. We will consider seeking pediatric exclusivity for our products whenever appropriate. For example, in response to a written request from the FDA to generate additional data, we conducted a Phase 3 clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of Xyrem in children and adolescents aged seven to 17 who have narcolepsy with cataplexy. We anticipate submitting an sNDA including data that fairly responds to the pediatric written request to the FDA in mid-2018.
In the EU, orphan drug designation may be granted to products that can be used to treat life-threatening diseases or chronically debilitating conditions with an incidence of no more than five in 10,000 people or that, for economic reasons, would be unlikely to be developed without incentives. Orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all EU member states and a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the similar product is deemed safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Defibrotide received orphan drug designation by the EC to treat and prevent VOD prior to grant of marketing authorization in the EU. It has also received orphan drug designation by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety for this indication. The Commonwealth of Australia-

Department of Health has granted defibrotide orphan drug designation for the treatment of VOD. In addition, the EC granted orphan drug designation to defibrotide for the prevention of aGvHD, another potentially fatal complication of HSCT.
Post-Approval Regulation
After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes, modifying a REMS or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further regulatory review and approval. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical studies be conducted.
Often, even after a drug or biologic has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may impose certain post-approval requirements, including the conduct of additional clinical studies and trials. Holders of an approved NDA or BLA are required to: report certain adverse reactions to the FDA; comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products; submit drug safety or adverse event reports; and continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP after approval. For example, the FDA’s approval of the BLA for Erwinaze includes a number of post-marketing commitments related to the manufacture of Erwinaze by us and PBL. 
Similarly, outside of the U.S., we are subject to a variety of post-authorization regulations, including with respect to clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising and promotion, distribution, and safety reporting. For example, the marketing authorization in the EU for Defitelio was granted under exceptional circumstances and requires us to comply with a number of post-marketing obligations, including obligations relating to the manufacturing of the drug substance and finished product, the submission of data concerning patients treated with the product collected through a third-party patient registry and the establishment of a multi-center, multinational and prospective observational patient registry.
We monitor adverse events resulting from the use of our commercial products, as do the regulatory authorities, and we file periodic reports with the authorities concerning adverse events. The FDA also periodically inspects our records related to safety reporting. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form FDA 483 and warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities. A Form FDA 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, can list conditions the FDA investigators believe may have violated relevant FDA regulations or guidance. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observation(s) can result in further regulatory enforcement action.
The authorities review these events and reports, and if they determine that any events and/or reports indicate a trend or signal, they can require a change in a product label, restrict sales and marketing and/or require or conduct other actions, potentially including withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market. From time to time, the FDA issues drug safety communications on its adverse event reporting system based on its review of reported adverse events. For more information, see the risk factor under the heading “The distribution and sale of Xyrem are subject to significant regulatory oversight and restrictions and the requirements of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, and these restrictions and requirements, as well as the potential impact of changes to these restrictions and requirements, subject us to increased risks and uncertainties, any of which could negatively impact sales of Xyrem” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must also comply with the EU’s pharmacovigilance legislation, which includes requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. The EMA reviews periodic safety update reports submitted by marketing authorization holders. If the EMA has concerns that the risk benefit profile of a product has varied, it can adopt an opinion advising that the existing marketing authorization for the product be varied and requiring the marketing authorization holder to conduct post-authorization safety studies. The opinion is then submitted for approval by the EC. Non-compliance with such obligations can lead to the variation, suspension or withdrawal of marketing authorization or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures.
The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated, and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. We and our third party suppliers are subject to cGMP, which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards as defined by the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of EU member states and other regulatory authorities. The FDA also periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to manufacturing facilities, which effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form FDA 483 and warning letters. In addition to Form FDA 483 notices and warning letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements may result in suspension of manufacturing, product seizure, withdrawal of the product from the market, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, among other enforcement remedies both in the U.S. and in non-U.S. countries. 
In addition, various requirements apply to the manufacturing and placing on the EU market of medicinal products. The manufacturing of medicinal products in the EU requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and APIs, including the manufacture of APIs outside of the EU with the intention to import the APIs into the EU. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products into 
23

and within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU member states. Marketing authorization holders may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of manufacturing authorization, in case of non-compliance with the EU or EU member states’ requirements applicable to the manufacturing of medicinal products.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to together as the Healthcare Reform Act, is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals, the provision of subsidies to eligible individuals enrolled in plans offered on the health insurance exchanges, and the expansion of the Medicaid program. This law has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the “donut hole”), rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, expansion of the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program, or 340B program, fraud and abuse and enforcement. These changes have impacted previously existing government healthcare programs and have resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. Details of the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and the 340B program are discussed under “Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement” in this Part I, Item 1 and the risk factor “If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs by raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is permitted under the Healthcare Reform Act. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact our sales, business and financial condition. Where Medicaid patients receive insurance coverage under any of the new options made available through the Healthcare Reform Act, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on drugs used under these circumstances, a decision that could impact manufacturer revenues. In addition, there have been delays in the implementation of key provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act, including the excise tax on generous employer-based health insurance plans. The implications of these delays for our sales, business and financial condition, if any, are not yet clear. 
Moreover, additional legislative changes to or regulatory changes under the Healthcare Reform Act remain possible and appear likely in the 115th U.S. Congress and under the Trump Administration. In this regard, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, signed into law in December 2017, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Healthcare Reform Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” The nature and extent of any additional legislative changes to the Healthcare Reform Act are uncertain at this time. We expect that the Healthcare Reform Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our existing products or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved.
Other Regulatory Requirements
We are also subject to regulation by other regional, national, state and local agencies, including the DEA, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, the U.S. Department of Commerce, or DOC, the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and other regulatory bodies. In addition to the FDCA, other statutes and regulations govern to varying degrees the research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities relating to prescription pharmaceutical products, including preclinical testing, approval, production, labeling, sale, distribution, import, export, post-market surveillance, advertising, dissemination of information, promotion, marketing, and pricing to government purchasers and government healthcare programs. Our partners, including our suppliers and distributors and the central pharmacy for Xyrem, are subject to many of the same requirements.
Controlled Substance Regulations
A drug product approved by the FDA may be subject to scheduling as a controlled substance under the CSA, depending on the drug’s potential for abuse.  Controlled substances that are pharmaceutical products are subject to a high degree of regulation under the CSA, which establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA classifies controlled substances into five schedules: Schedule I, II, III, IV or V. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, 
24

have no currently “accepted medical use” in the U.S., lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in the U.S. Pharmaceutical products approved for use in the U.S. may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Sodium oxybate, in the form of an API, is regulated by the DEA as a Schedule I controlled substance. When contained in Xyrem, sodium oxybate is regulated as a Schedule III controlled substance. We expect that solriamfetol will be subject to scheduling under the CSA, which will need to be completed after NDA approval and before commercial launch. Individual states also impose similar requirements for controlled substances. 
The DEA limits the quantity of certain Schedule I controlled substances that may be manufactured and procured in the U.S. in any given calendar year through a quota system and, as a result, quotas from the DEA are required in order to manufacture and package sodium oxybate and Xyrem in the U.S. Accordingly, we require DEA quotas for Siegfried, our U.S.‑based sodium oxybate supplier, to procure sodium oxybate and for Patheon, our U.S.-based Xyrem supplier, to obtain the sodium oxybate from Siegfried in order to manufacture and supply us with Xyrem. 
As a Schedule III drug, Xyrem is also subject to DEA and state regulations relating to manufacturing, storage, distribution and physician prescription procedures, including limitations on prescription refills. In addition, the third parties who perform our clinical and commercial manufacturing, distribution, dispensing and clinical studies for Xyrem are required to maintain necessary DEA registrations and state licenses. The DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with its rules and regulations. For more information, see the risk factor under the heading “We are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, which may result in significant additional expense and limit our ability to commercialize our products” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Sales and Marketing Regulations
We are also subject to various U.S. federal and state laws restricting certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. Violations of the federal anti-kickback statute may be punished by civil and criminal fines, imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The federal civil False Claims Act, or the False Claims Act, prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of federal funds, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Violations of the False Claims Act may result in significant financial penalties and damages. In addition, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act require extensive tracking of payments and transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and public reporting of the data collected, and government agencies and private entities may inquire about our marketing practices or pursue other enforcement activities based on the disclosures in those public reports.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and the False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. A number of states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in the states. Other states restrict when pharmaceutical companies may provide meals to prescribers or engage in other marketing related activities. Some states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, California, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Nevada require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct. Outside the U.S., we are also subject to similar regulations in those countries where we market and sell products.
The number and complexity of both U.S. federal and state laws continue to increase, and additional governmental resources are being added to enforce these laws and to prosecute companies and individuals who are believed to be violating them. In May and October 2016 and in February 2017, we received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts requesting documents related to our support of 501(c)(3) organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients and documents concerning the provision of financial assistance to Medicare patients taking drugs sold by us. We are cooperating with the government’s investigation of our support of charitable organizations, and the outcome of this investigation could include an enforcement action or a settlement with the federal government. The OIG has established guidelines that permit pharmaceutical manufacturers to make donations to charitable organizations who provide co-pay assistance to Medicare patients, provided that such organizations, among other things, are bona fide charities, are entirely independent of and not controlled by the manufacturer, provide aid to applicants on a first-come basis according to consistent financial criteria, and do not link aid to use of a donor’s product. If we or our vendors or donation recipients are deemed to fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or evolving government guidance in the operation of these programs, such facts could be used as the basis for an enforcement action by the federal government. If the federal government were to file an enforcement action against us as a result of the investigation and could establish the elements of a violation of relevant laws, 
25

we could be subject to damages, fines and penalties, which could be substantial, along with other criminal, civil or administrative sanctions. Any settlement with the federal government could result in substantial payments and entry into a corporate integrity agreement, which would impose costs and burdens on the operation of our business. For more information regarding applicable laws and regulations, see the risk factor under the heading “We are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, which may result in significant additional expense and limit our ability to commercialize our products-Other Regulatory Authorities” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The FDA, the competent authorities of the EU member states and other governmental authorities require advertising and promotional labeling to be truthful and not misleading, and products to be marketed only for their approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA routinely provides its interpretations of that authority in informal communications and also in more formal communications such as untitled letters or warning letters, and although such communications may not be considered final agency decisions, companies may decide not to contest the agency’s interpretations so as to avoid disputes with the FDA, even if they believe the claims to be truthful, not misleading and otherwise lawful. In recent years, certain courts have determined that the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution permits communications regarding off-label uses of drug products, as long as such communications are truthful and not misleading. At the beginning of 2017, the FDA released proposed rule changes and draft guidance on FDA’s interpretation on the limitations of such speech. These cases and regulatory actions create additional uncertainty regarding the limits of permissible communication regarding our products. 
The FDA, the competent authorities of the EU member states and other governmental authorities also actively investigate allegations of off-label promotion activities in order to enforce regulations prohibiting these types of activities. A company that is found to have promoted an approved product for off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative financial penalties and other remedies as well as criminal financial penalties and other sanctions. Even when a company is not determined to have engaged in off-label promotion, the allegation from government authorities or market participants that a company has engaged in such activities could have a significant impact on the company’s sales, business and financial condition. The U.S. government has also required companies that have engaged in such activities to enter into complex corporate integrity agreements and deferred- or non-prosecution agreements that impose significant reporting and other burdens on the affected companies. For all of our products, it is important that we maintain a comprehensive compliance program. Failure to maintain a comprehensive and effective compliance program, and to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into a combined comprehensive and effective compliance program on a timely basis, could subject us to a range of regulatory actions that could affect our ability to commercialize our products and could harm or prevent sales of the affected products, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing our products.
In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products are subject to EU member states’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual EU member states may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with health care professionals.
To help patients afford our products, we have various programs to assist them, including patient assistance programs, a Xyrem free product voucher program and co-pay coupon programs for certain products. These programs and related risks are discussed in greater detail in the risk factor under the heading “Changes in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including those based on recently enacted legislation, as well as changes in healthcare policy, may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict and these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Anti-Corruption Legislation
Our business activities outside of the U.S. are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act of 2010, or the UK Bribery Act. The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws in foreign countries generally prohibit the offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to U.S. or non-U.S. government officials in order to improperly influence any act or decision, secure an improper advantage, or obtain or retain business. Excepted from the FCPA are payments to facilitate or expedite routine government action and bona fide, reasonable reimbursement of expenses. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. The UK Bribery Act prohibits giving, offering, or promising bribes to any person, including UK and non-UK government officials and private persons, as well as requesting, agreeing to receive, or accepting bribes from any person. In addition, under the UK Bribery Act, companies which carry on a business or part of a business in the UK may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person, including UK and non-UK government officials and private persons in any country, by employees and persons associated with 
26

the company in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company. Liability is strict, with no element of a corrupt state of mind, but a defense of having in place adequate procedures designed to prevent bribery is available. Furthermore, under the UK Bribery Act there is no exception for facilitation payments. As described above, our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to the FCPA. Recently the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the DOJ have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank Act, private individuals who report to the SEC original information that leads to successful enforcement actions may be eligible for a monetary award. We are engaged in ongoing efforts that are designed to ensure our compliance with these laws, including due diligence, training, policies, procedures, and internal controls. However, there is no certainty that all employees and third party business partners (including our distributors, wholesalers, agents, contractors, and other partners) will comply with anti-bribery laws. In particular, we do not control the actions of our suppliers and other third party agents, although we may be liable for their actions. Violation of these laws may result in civil or criminal sanctions, which could include monetary fines, criminal penalties, and disgorgement of past profits, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.
Data Privacy and Protection 
We are also subject to laws and regulations governing privacy and data security. These laws include security breach notification requirements and protection of consumer health information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues which may affect our business. Although there are legal mechanisms to facilitate the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area, or EEA, and Switzerland to the U.S., the decision of the European Court of Justice that invalidated the safe harbor framework on which we previously relied has increased uncertainty around compliance with EU privacy law requirements. As a result of the decision, it was no longer possible to rely on safe harbor certification as a legal basis for the transfer of personal data from the EU to entities in the U.S. In February 2016, the EC announced an agreement with the DOC to replace the invalidated safe harbor framework with a new EU-U.S. “Privacy Shield.” On July 12, 2016, the EC adopted a decision on the adequacy of the protection provided by the Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is intended to address the requirements set out by the European Court of Justice in its recent ruling by imposing more stringent obligations on companies, providing stronger monitoring and enforcement by the DOC and FTC and making commitments on the part of public authorities regarding access to information. 
U.S.-based companies may certify compliance with the privacy principles of the Privacy Shield. Certification to the Privacy Shield, however, is not mandatory. If a U.S.-based company does not certify compliance with the Privacy Shield, it may rely on other authorized mechanisms to transfer personal data. In September 2016, we filed for certification for our U.S.-based subsidiaries under the Privacy Shield. This certification was approved in January 2017.
The privacy and data security landscape is still in flux. In October 2016, an action for annulment of the EC decision on the adequacy of Privacy Shield was brought before the European Court of Justice by three French digital rights advocacy groups, La Quadrature du Net, French Data Network and the Fédération FDN. This case, Case T-738/16, is currently pending before the European Court of Justice. Should the European Court of Justice invalidate the Privacy Shield, it will no longer be possible to transfer data from the EU to entities in the U.S. under a Privacy Shield certification, in which case other legal mechanisms would need to be put in place. 
Healthcare providers who prescribe our products and research institutions that we collaborate with are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates or our agents knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. 
Failure to comply with current and future laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (including the imposition of significant penalties), criminal and civil liability for us and our officers and directors and/or adverse publicity that negatively affect our business. 
If we or our vendors fail to comply with applicable data privacy laws, or if the legal mechanisms we or our vendors rely upon to allow for the transfer of personal data from the EEA or Switzerland to the U.S. (or other countries not considered by the EC to provide an adequate level of data protection) are not considered adequate, we could be subject to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and our business could be adversely impacted if our ability to transfer personal data outside of the EEA or Switzerland is restricted, which could adversely impact our operating results. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, which was officially adopted in April 2016 and will be applicable in May 2018, will 
27

introduce new data protection requirements in the EU, as well as substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The EU General Data Protection Regulation will increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new EU data protection rules. In addition, data protection authorities of the different EU member states may interpret the EU Data Protection Directive and national laws differently, and guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU.
Additional requirements and restrictions regarding, among other things, the export and importation of products, intellectual property rights, the environment, taxation and work safety apply in individual countries, and non-compliance with such requirements may result in civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement 
Our ability to commercialize our products successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our products, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third party payors, including governmental payors (such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.), managed care organizations and private health insurers. Third party payors decide which drugs can be reimbursed and establish reimbursement and co-pay levels and conditions for reimbursement. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In some cases, for example, third party payors try to encourage the use of less expensive generic products through their prescription benefits coverage and reimbursement and co-pay policies. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic and/or clinical studies in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our products. Even with studies, our products may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than other products, and third party payors may not provide and maintain price approvals, coverage and reimbursement for our products or any of our product candidates that we commercialize, in whole or in part. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. For example, third party payors have started to require discounts and/or exclusivity arrangements with some drug manufacturers in exchange for including a specific product on their formularies. Any such requirements could have a negative impact on revenues from sales of our current and potential future products.
 In the U.S., drug pricing by pharmaceutical companies is currently, and is expected to continue to be, under close scrutiny, including with respect to companies that have increased the price of products after acquiring those products from other companies. Several states have recently passed laws aimed at increasing transparency relating to drug pricing, and other states may do so in the future. For more information, see the risk factors under the headings “Changes in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including those based on recently enacted legislation, as well as changes in healthcare policy, may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict, and these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition” and “We are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, which may result in significant additional expense and limit our ability to commercialize our products” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
We participate in and have certain price reporting obligations to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, several state Medicaid supplemental rebate programs and other governmental pricing programs, and we have obligations to report the average sales price for certain of our drugs to the Medicare program. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Part B of the Medicare program. Risks relating to price reporting and payment obligations are further discussed in the risk factor under the heading “If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the 340B program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. 
28

In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program. Under this program, we are obligated to make our products available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies - the VA, U.S. Department of Defense, Public Health Service and U.S. Coast Guard - that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price, or FCP. The FCP is based on the non-federal average manufacturer price, or Non-FAMP, which we calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. We also participate in the Tricare Retail Pharmacy program, under which we pay quarterly rebates on utilization of innovator products that are dispensed through the Tricare Retail Pharmacy network to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and FCP.
Similar to what is occurring in the U.S., political, economic and regulatory developments outside of the U.S. are also subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes and challenges. Pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels continue to exist. In various EU member states we expect to be subject to continuous cost-cutting measures, such as lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative. Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU member states, including countries representing major markets. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products, as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU member states. Pursuant to Directive 2011/24/EU, a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU member states was established. The EU member states were required to implement the provisions of the Directive into their national legislation by October 2013. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This could lead to harmonization between EU member states of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTA and their impact on pricing and reimbursement decisions.
In the EU, our products are marketed through various channels and within different legal frameworks. In certain EU member states, reimbursement for unauthorized products is provided through national named patient or compassionate use programs. Such reimbursement may no longer be available if authorization for named patient or compassionate use programs expire or are terminated or if marketing authorization is granted for the product. In other EU member states, authorization and reimbursement policies may also delay commercialization of our products, or may adversely affect our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. After initial price and reimbursement approvals, reductions in prices and changes in reimbursement levels can be triggered by multiple factors, including reference pricing systems and publication of discounts by third party payors or authorities in other countries. In the EU, prices can be reduced further by parallel distribution and parallel trade, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced EU member states.

As of February 20, 2018, we had approximately 1,210 employees worldwide. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Environment, Health and Safety
Our operations are subject to complex and increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and, in particular, in Italy and Ireland where we have manufacturing facilities. Our manufacturing activities in Italy and Ireland involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of chemicals and solvents. Environmental and health and safety authorities in the relevant jurisdictions administer laws governing, among other matters, the emission of pollutants into the air (including the workplace), the discharge of pollutants into bodies of water, the storage, use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, the exposure of persons to hazardous substances, and the general health, safety and welfare of employees and members of the public. In certain cases, such laws, directives and regulations may impose strict liability for pollution of the environment and contamination resulting from spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances or waste or any migration of such hazardous substances or waste. Costs, damages and/or fines may result from the

presence, investigation and remediation of such contamination at properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by us or at off-site locations, including where we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or waste. In addition, we may be subject to third party claims, including for natural resource damages, personal injury and property damage, in connection with such contamination.
