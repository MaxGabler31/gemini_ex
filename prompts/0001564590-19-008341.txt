Item 1. Business. 
 
On March 4, 2019, we entered into an implementation agreement, or the Implementation Agreement, with Biogen Switzerland Holdings GmbH and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tungsten Bidco Limited, which 
we collectively refer to as Biogen. Pursuant to the terms of the Implementation Agreement, Biogen has agreed to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of our company for $25.50 in cash per ordinary share, nominal value of GBP 0.01 per 
share, or the Company Shares, excluding any treasury shares, any Company Shares held by Biogen or its subsidiaries 
and certain pre-initial public offering equity awards deferred upon the termination of the holder’s employment, which we refer to as the Deferred Shares. Under the terms of the Implementation Agreement, the proposed acquisition would be implemented by means of a scheme of arrangement to be undertaken by us under Part 26 of the UK Companies Act 2006. Biogen reserves the right under the Implementation Agreement to effect the proposed acquisition by way of a takeover offer, with our consent.
 The completion of the proposed acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among other things: the absence of any law or order by any governmental authority enjoining, preventing, restraining, prohibiting or otherwise making illegal the proposed acquisition; the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and approval from competition authorities in Germany; the accuracy of our representations and warranties under the Implementation Agreement (subject to a material adverse effect standard in most cases); our compliance with our obligations under the Implementation Agreement; 
and the absence of a “Company Material Adverse Effect,” as defined in the Implementation Agreement.  The proposed acquisition is also subject to, among other things: approval by at least 75% in value and a majority in number of the holders of Company Shares, which we refer to as the Company Shareholders, present, entitled to vote 
and voting (in person or by proxy) at the meeting to be convened by order of the High Court of Justice in England and Wales, or the Court, in order for the Company Shareholders to consider, and if thought fit, to approve, the scheme of arrangement; the passing of all resolutions necessary to approve and implement the scheme of arrangement by at least 75% of Company Shareholders present, entitled to vote and voting (in person or by proxy) at the general meeting to be convened for Company Shareholders to consider, and if thought fit approve, certain matters in connection with the scheme of arrangement and the proposed acquisition; and the sanctioning of the scheme of arrangement by the Court.
 The Implementation Agreement contains certain termination rights for each of us and Biogen. Under specified circumstances, we are permitted to terminate the Implementation Agreement to accept a superior proposal (generally defined as a proposal for 80% or more of the voting power and economic rights in us or all or substantially all of our assets, which proposal our board of directors has determined, in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors, (i) would result in greater value to Company Shareholders from a financial point of view than the proposed acquisition, including a price per Company Share payable in cash that is more than 7.5% above that offered in the proposed acquisition and (ii) is reasonably likely to be completed relative to the proposed acquisition).
 At this stage, subject to the approval and availability of the Court (which is subject to change), and subject to the satisfaction (or, where applicable, waiver) of the conditions to the Implementation Agreement, we expect the acquisition will become effective by mid-year 2019. If the transaction is completed, we expect that the ADSs will be removed from listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market and that registration of the ADSs under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, will be terminated.

 Overview
 We are a leading clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on developing and commercializing novel one-time treatments for patients suffering from rare inherited retinal diseases that would otherwise progress to blindness. Leveraging our expertise in ophthalmology, gene therapy and drug development, we are developing a pipeline of proprietary product candidates that are designed to substantially modify or halt the progression of inherited retinal diseases for which there are no currently approved treatments. 
 Our lead product candidate, NSR-REP1, is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of choroideremia, or CHM, and represents the most clinically advanced product candidate for this indication worldwide. In data from 32 patients treated with NSR-REP1 across four open-label clinical trials, over 90% of treated patients maintained their visual acuity, or VA, over a two-year follow-up period. In some cases, we also observed substantial improvements in visual acuity. In June 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designation for NSR-REP1 in CHM. 
 2

Our second product candidate, NSR-RPGR, is in Phase 2/3 clinical development for the treatment of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, or XLRP, in a clinical trial known as XIRIUS. XIRIUS consists of an open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation study followed by a Phase 2/3 expansion study. Enrollment of the Phase 1 dose escalation study in the XIRIUS trial was completed in August 2018, consisting of six cohorts of three patients each for a total of 18 adult patients. On September 22, 2018, we announced positive preliminary safety and efficacy data from this trial for the first five cohorts (combined n=15) of the Phase 1 dose escalation study at the EURETINA medical meeting, as described further below. The safety data and efficacy signals observed in the higher dose groups of the dose escalation study provided the basis for an early clinical proof of concept allowing the XIRIUS trial to progress to the Phase 2/3 expansion study. The ongoing Phase 2/3 expansion study is intended to enroll approximately 45 patients, with 15 patients receiving a high-dose, 15 patients receiving a low dose, and 15 patients receiving no treatment (no-sham, parallel arm). We also have product candidates in preclinical development for a number of inherited retinal diseases for which there are no approved treatments, such as Stargardt disease, the most common form of inherited juvenile macular dystrophy.

Gene Therapy is Ideally Suited for Inherited Retinal Diseases 
 We believe that we are differentiated by our strength and focus in gene therapy and inherited retinal diseases. Gene therapy is used to overcome the effects of a defective, disease-causing gene by using engineered viruses, or viral vectors, to deliver a functional version of the gene into cells. Once inserted into the patient, the delivered gene utilizes available cellular mechanisms to produce a functional protein that leads to a therapeutic effect. Vectors based on adeno-associated virus, or AAV, are believed to be especially well suited for treating retinal diseases because AAV is a small, replication-deficient virus that is non-pathogenic and has a well-documented safety profile. Over 250 genes that play a role in inherited retinal diseases have been identified, although fewer than 20 of these targets are currently in clinical development. 
 We believe the eye is an excellent target organ for gene therapy due to its accessibility, small size, compartmentalization and relative immune privileged status. The vectors can be directly injected into the diseased tissue and can be non-invasively observed for efficacy and safety. The blood-ocular barrier prevents the widespread dissemination of locally-administered vectors throughout the body. Given the small volume of the eye, the amount of vector needed to achieve a therapeutic effect is low, reducing the amount of vector

required to be administered to the patient and reducing potential systemic side effects. In addition, the reduced volume requirement provides us with the advantage of small-scale manufacturing requirements for clinical trials and potential commercialization. 
 Our Lead Retinal Gene Therapy Product Candidate: NSR-REP1 for the Treatment of CHM 
 Our lead retinal gene therapy product candidate, NSR-REP1, is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of CHM and represents the most clinically advanced product candidate for this indication worldwide, potentially providing us with a significant industry first-mover advantage. We have received orphan drug designation for NSR-REP1 for the treatment of CHM from the FDA in the United States and from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the European Union and RMAT designation from the FDA. 
CHM Disease Overview 
 CHM is a rare, degenerative, X-linked genetic retinal disorder primarily affecting males, with no treatments currently available and represents a significant unmet medical need. CHM presents in childhood as night blindness, followed by progressive constriction of the visual fields, generally leading to vision loss in early adulthood and total blindness thereafter. Patients generally maintain good visual acuity until the degeneration encroaches onto the fovea, which is the central part of the retina responsible for detailed vision. The prevalence of CHM is estimated to be one in 50,000 people, implying a total population of approximately 13,000 patients in the United States and the five major European markets. 
 CHM is caused by mutations in the CHM gene, which encodes Rab escort protein-1, or REP1, a protein that plays a key role in intracellular protein trafficking and the elimination of waste products from retinal cells. Absence of functional REP1 leads to death of the retinal pigment epithelium, or RPE, cells and degeneration of the overlying retina, which contains the retinal photoreceptors required to convert light into visual signals. Thus, the loss of REP1 function in retinal cells caused by CHM results in progressive vision loss and blindness. 
 
Our Solution: NSR-REP1 for CHM 
 Our lead retinal gene therapy product candidate, NSR-REP1, is comprised of an AAV2 vector containing recombinant human complementary DNA, or cDNA, that is designed to produce REP1 inside the eye. NSR-REP1 is comprised of a standard AAV vector combined with the human REP1 cDNA and a woodchuck hepatitis post-transcriptional regulatory element, or WPRE, sequence. In preclinical animal studies, the incorporation of the WPRE sequence resulted in a statistically significant, nearly two-fold increase in REP1 expression in the retina from baseline, which could provide a greater therapeutic effect than a REP1 vector without the WPRE sequence. The introduction of a functional CHM gene into patients is intended to allow expression of REP1, thereby slowing or stopping the progression of CHM and the decline in vision. 
 NSR-REP1 is administered by injection into the sub-retinal space, preceded by a standard vitrectomy procedure to allow for better visualization of the injection site. NSR-REP1 is delivered using a two-step process to enhance surgical precision. The first step in this process involves the creation of a small bubble, or bleb, in the sub-retinal space with a small amount of balanced salt solution, followed by the second step in which NSR-REP1 is administered into this newly created sub-retinal bleb. Surgical precision is further enhanced by intra-operative optical coherence tomography, or iOCT, providing the surgeon with real-time, cross-sectional imaging of the precise location of NSR-REP1 administration into the sub-retinal space.
Clinical Development of NSR-REP1 
 The table below sets forth summary information regarding our completed clinical trials for NSR-REP1.

Phase 1/2 Oxford Trial and Phase 2 Investigator-Sponsored Clinical Trials, or ISTs 
 Across four ISTs, a total of 32 patients have been treated with NSR-REP1 and have completed at least two-years of follow-up after initial treatment. In January 2014, the positive initial six-month proof-of-concept efficacy and safety data from the first cohort of six patients in a Phase 1/2 open-label, dose-escalation, single-eye IST conducted at the University of Oxford, or the Oxford Trial, were published in The Lancet. Additional data supporting the long-term durability of up to five years of treatment effect in the first cohort in the Oxford Trial was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April 2016 and Nature Medicine in October 2018.
 The results from the first cohort of six patients treated in the Oxford Trial indicated NSR-REP1 was generally well tolerated. Five patients received the intended low dose of approximately 1.0 × 1010 genome particles, or gp, while the sixth patient received a sub-therapeutic dose due to the surgeon’s concern about stretching this patient’s already thin retina. After one-year of follow-up, visual acuity either improved or returned to within five ETDRS letters, or one line, of baseline for all five patients who received the intended dose of NSR-REP1. We consider this type of sustained maintenance in visual acuity to be clinically meaningful in an otherwise degenerative disease like CHM. Further, at one-year post-treatment, we observed that one of the five patients gained 22 ETDRS letters, or four lines, and another patient gained 16 ETDRS letters, or three lines, in visual acuity. At five years post-treatment of this first cohort, we further observed that the duration of response following a single injection of NSR-REP1 was maintained in all five patients, consistent with the 42-month data published in April 2016. 
 Based on the initial positive efficacy and safety data generated from the Oxford Trial, a second cohort of eight patients was treated at the University of Oxford with a ten-fold higher dose of approximately 1.0 × 1011 gp of NSR-REP1, which we refer to as the high dose for purposes of our clinical development of NSR-REP1. 
 Over the entire group of 14 patients treated in the Oxford Trial, after two years of follow-up the median visual acuity improved by 4.5 letters in the treated eyes compared with a loss of 1.5 letters in the untreated eyes. At the last follow up (ranging from two to five years), we observed that visual acuity had been maintained or increased in all 12 treatment eyes that had received gene therapy as per protocol, compared with only four of the 12 untreated eyes. 
 Subsequent to the Oxford Trial, three other investigator-sponsored, open-label, single-center, single-eye Phase 2 clinical trials were initiated in the United States, Canada and Germany treating six patients at each clinical site. In these three additional clinical trials, patients were treated with the same high dose of NSR-REP1 as was used to treat the second cohort in the Oxford Trial. 
 The chart below shows a retrospective analysis of the data for patients treated with NSR-REP1 in the four ISTs and untreated patients completing the last-follow-up visit in the NIGHT study, which study is further described below. The chart indicates that only two of the 26 patients, or 8%, who received the high-dose of NSR-REP1 in the ISTs experienced a loss in visual acuity of five or more ETDRS letters at the two-year follow-up period. Across the patients in both the high-dose and low-dose groups who received the intended dose of NSR-REP1 in the four ISTs, only three of the 31 patients, or 10%, experienced a loss in visual acuity of five or more ETDRS letters at the two-year follow-up period. By comparison, in the NIGHT study, we observed that 68 out of the 308 eyes assessed, or 22%, experienced a loss in visual acuity of five or more ETDRS letters at the 20-month follow-up period. In the NIGHT study, the last evaluable time point is 20 months and some patients were eligible to have both of their eyes assessed based on the entry visual acuity criteria.

In addition to the effects on maintenance of vision observed after treatment with NSR-REP1, as mentioned above, some patients achieved gains in visual acuity of greater than 15 ETDRS letters. We refer to these patients as hyper-responders. The following graph shows that the treatment effect observed for the five hyper-responders treated with NSR-REP1 in our ISTs was observed as early as one month after treatment and that the benefit was generally maintained from three months after treatment to at least five years post-treatment, which is currently the longest evaluable follow-up time point available. In patient B below, the decline in visual acuity observed at 1.5 years was due to vitrectomy-related cataract formation. Following a routine cataract extraction performed prior to this 1.5 year follow-up time point, patient B’s visual acuity improved in a manner consistent with the other treated patients in the clinical trial. 
 
To further investigate the subset of patients most likely to generate a hyper-response, we classified the 32 patients from the four ISTs into three groups based on their baseline visual acuity ranges. These ranges are based on standard ophthalmology diagnosis codes: 
  
▪ | Mild Visual Acuity Loss to Normal Vision—Patients with greater than 73 ETDRS letters of visual acuity (better than 20/40 vision): This group (n=12 patients) includes patients who are within 15 ETDRS letters of 20/20 vision and, therefore, cannot gain the required 15 ETDRS letters due to a ceiling effect.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Moderate to Severe Visual Acuity Loss—Patients between 34 and 73 ETDRS letters of visual acuity (20/40-20/200 vision): This group (n=19 patients) includes patients whose visual acuity is at least 15 letters below normal vision and are most likely to have sufficient viable residual tissue to treat.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Severe to Profound Vision Loss—Patients with less than 34 ETDRS letters of visual acuity (worse than 20/200 vision): This group (n=1 patient) corresponds to the criteria for legal blindness in most jurisdictions and represents a stage of advanced CHM where sub-retinal surgery is extremely challenging.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The greatest proportion of hyper-responders was observed in patients with a Moderate to Severe Visual Acuity Loss classification. At one-year follow-up after treatment, four out of 19 treated patients in this group, or 21%, experienced a gain in visual acuity of at least 15 ETDRS letters from baseline as compared to 1% of all untreated patients in the NIGHT study. These results, if observed in a randomized, controlled clinical trial, would represent a p-value of 0.001. P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical trial results. A p-value of less than 0.05 is generally considered to represent statistical significance, meaning that there is a less than five percent likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. The 20% differential between the rate of hyper-responders in the four ISTs and the rate of hyper-responders in the NIGHT study is comparable to that observed in clinical trials for other FDA-approved retinal therapies. Based on these efficacy results, our understanding of the progression of CHM and our experience treating CHM patients, we selected patients with a Moderate to Severe Visual Acuity Loss classification as the target population for our ongoing STAR Phase 3 registrational trial and we have designed the STAR trial to allow these findings to be replicated in a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial setting. 
 Natural History Observational Studies
 We are conducting a prospective, natural history observational study in CHM called the NIGHT study and have enrolled over 300 CHM patients. The NIGHT study provides important evidence regarding the disease state and rate of progression in untreated patients and provides a benchmark against which to compare the effects of NSR-REP1, which is also expected to provide valuable insights supporting pre-commercial activities. In the NIGHT study, we observed that 68 out of the 308 eyes assessed, or 22%, experienced a loss in visual acuity of five or more ETDRS letters at the 20-month follow-up period. In the NIGHT study, the final evaluable time point is 20 months and some patients were eligible to have both of their eyes assessed based on the entry visual acuity criteria. We are recruiting participants for our Phase 3 STAR trial primarily from the NIGHT study to significantly accelerate enrollment in the STAR trial from this well-characterized patient population.
 We are also planning a longer-term observational study in CHM called the ULYSSES study. Patients characterized in the NIGHT study will be transitioned to the ULYSSES study and followed long-term. We expect these data to support potential future payer and regulatory interactions.
 RMAT Designation 
 In June 2018, the FDA granted RMAT designation to NSR-REP1 based on clinical data supporting the maintenance and improvement of visual acuity from the four completed ISTs in CHM patients treated with NSR-REP1 and disease progression in untreated patients in the ongoing NIGHT study. Established under the 21st Century Cures Act, the RMAT designation is an expedited program for the advancement and approval of regenerative medicine products. A regenerative medicine is eligible for this designation if it is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. RMAT designation allows companies developing regenerative medicine and gene therapies to work more closely and frequently with the FDA and grants all of the benefits of breakthrough therapy designation, as further described below under “—Government Regulation,” including eligibility for priority review, rolling review, and accelerated approval. 
 STAR Phase 3 Registrational Trial 
 In March 2018, we announced the initiation of our Phase 3 STAR registrational trial of NSR-REP1 in CHM. The trial is designed to study the safety and efficacy of NSR-REP1 in patients with a diagnosis of CHM due to REP1 mutations, as confirmed by genetic testing. The primary endpoint of the STAR trial is to measure the proportion of patients with an improvement of at least 15 ETDRS letters from baseline in visual acuity at 12 months post-treatment. Secondary endpoints include both anatomical and functional endpoints of efficacy and safety similar to the endpoints assessed in earlier clinical trials for NSR-REP1. 
 In the STAR trial, we intend to enroll approximately 160 patients across 18 clinical sites in the United States, Europe, Canada and South America, of which six sites are surgical centers. In order to be eligible to enter the STAR trial, patients must have a Moderate to Severe Visual Acuity Loss classification. The eligible patients will be randomized into one of three study arms: 64 patients receiving a high-dose NSR-REP1 in one eye (1.0 × 1011  gp); 32 patients receiving a low-dose NSR-REP1 in one eye (1.0 × 1010 gp); and 64 patients in an untreated, no-sham parallel-control arm. The primary endpoint will be assessed by comparing patients in the high-dose treatment arm with patients in the control arm. We are primarily recruiting patients in the STAR trial from the NIGHT study to significantly accelerate Phase 3 enrollment from this well-characterized patient population. 
 The following chart summarizes the design of the STAR Phase 3 registrational trial:

We designed the STAR trial, including the statistical analyses, based on data from patients treated with NSR-REP1 in our earlier clinical trials and ISTs and untreated patients from our NIGHT study. The doses in the STAR trial are equivalent to those studied in the earlier Phase 1/2 and Phase 2 ISTs. To achieve a statistical significance level of p≤0.05, between six and ten patients out of the 64 patients in the high-dose group, or 9% to 16% (assuming zero and two responses from patients in the control arm, respectively), will need to meet the primary endpoint criteria of a 15-letter improvement in visual acuity. This result would compare favorably to the 21% of patients who met the same criteria in the subgroup of the Phase 1/2 and Phase 2 ISTs previously conducted. 
 Safety Observations from Completed Clinical Trials of NSR-REP1 
 As of the date of this Annual Report, available clinical data from the 32 treated patients in the completed ISTs indicates that NSR-REP1 was generally well tolerated. The safety profile in the completed ISTs is consistent with that of surgical vitrectomy procedures generally and what has been observed in clinical trials of other ocular gene therapies. Adverse events of varying severity and duration related to the vitrectomy procedure or drug have been observed in the completed ISTs such as retinal changes, intraocular inflammation and visual disturbances, which generally resolved within one week after surgery. The adverse events observed in our ongoing clinical trials of NSR-REP1 have also generally been consistent with the adverse events seen in the completed ISTs and other ocular gene therapy trials.
 Two serious adverse events have been reported in the completed ISTs. One of these events was not ocular in nature and was determined to be unrelated to treatment with NSR-REP1, but rather related to a gas bubble in the surgical tubing. The other patient experienced intraocular inflammation, requiring additional treatment with oral steroids. This transient inflammation was determined to be possibly related to treatment with NSR-REP1.
 
Other Clinical Programs of NSR-REP1 in CHM 
 NSR-REP1 is also currently being studied in the REGENERATE trial, an open-label, exploratory, single-eye Phase 2 clinical trial intended to enroll up to 30 patients with an early-stage diagnosis of CHM. NSR-REP1 is also currently being studied in an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial known as the GEMINI trial to evaluate the safety of bilateral administration of a single dose of NSR-REP1 in both eyes of approximately 60 CHM patients, including patients added to the STAR and IST trials. These data are intended to support discussions with payers and regulators.
 Summary of Additional Clinical Trials Required For Regulatory Submissions 
 If the results of the STAR trial confirm the efficacy observed to date, we intend to submit a biologics license application, or BLA, to the FDA for the approval of NSR-REP1 for the treatment of CHM in the United States and a marketing authorization application, or MAA to the EMA for approval in the European Union. 
 Based on our interactions with the FDA and EMA, we believe that, in addition to the successful completion of the STAR trial, we will also need to collect five-year follow-up data, which may be completed on a post-marketing basis, for all treated CHM patients to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of a sub-retinal injection of NSR-REP1. 
 FDA guidelines generally require multiple Phase 3 clinical trials in support of a BLA but provide that a single registrational trial may be appropriate in some circumstances. We have designed the STAR trial for it to be the only Phase 3 trial required to support a potential BLA for NSR-REP1. However, it is possible that the FDA or EMA may require that we treat additional patients or initiate or complete additional clinical trials and preclinical studies before considering our BLA or MAA, respectively, for approval.

NSR-RPGR for the Treatment of XLRP 
 NSR-RPGR, is in Phase 2/3 clinical development for the treatment of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, or XLRP, in a clinical trial known as XIRIUS. The XIRIUS trial consists of an open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation study followed by a Phase 2/3 expansion study. Enrollment of the Phase 1 dose escalation study in the XIRIUS trial was completed in August 2018, consisting of six cohorts of three patients each for a total of 18 adult patients. On September 22, 2018, we announced positive preliminary safety and efficacy data from the XIRIUS trial for the first five cohorts (combined n=15) of the dose escalation study at the EURETINA medical meeting. The Phase 2/3 expansion study in the XIRIUS trial is currently ongoing. 
 We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA in the United States and from the EMA in the European Union for NSR-RPGR for the treatment of XLRP. We received Fast Track designation from the FDA for NSR-RPGR in November 2018.
 XLRP Disease Overview 
 XLRP, a form of retinitis pigmentosa, is a rare inherited X-linked recessive genetic retinal disorder primarily affecting males. The disease is characterized by a lack of protein transport that leads to a loss of photoreceptors, resulting in rapid disease progression and severe retinal dysfunction. Approximately 70% of XLRP cases are due to variants in the genes responsible for the production of RPGR. RPGR is involved in the transport of proteins necessary for the maintenance of photoreceptor cells. Loss of RPGR function in the retinal cells causes the progressive loss of rod and cone photoreceptors, leading to the loss of vision experienced by patients. The estimated worldwide prevalence of XLRP due to RPGR variants is approximately one in 40,000 people, which implies approximately 17,000 patients in the United States and the five major European markets. There are no known treatments currently available for XLRP. 
 The onset, progression, severity and clinical manifestations of XLRP vary from patient to patient. Typically, male patients first experience increasing symptoms of night blindness in the first decade, followed by a narrowing of their peripheral vision, and progressive loss of central vision in the patient’s second or third decade. Legal or total blindness commonly occurs when the patient reaches his forties.
 Assessing Changes in Retinal Sensitivity: Microperimetry
 Microperimetry measures changes in visual function by gauging the ability to detect varying levels of light stimulus projected across the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for visual acuity. In the XIRIUS trial, microperimetry was measured on a grid of 68 points across the macula. Each of the 68 points, or loci, has a corresponding decibel, or dB, score that describes the intensity of the light stimulus that was detected by the patient. The stimulus range varies between 0 dB, or the brightest stimulus the instrument can produce, and 36 dB, or the faintest stimulus. Comparisons are made to baseline measurements in the treated eye as well as in comparisons to untreated eyes in the untreated control group. 
 Our Solution: NSR-RPGR for XLRP 
 NSR-RPGR is comprised of a standard AAV8 vector containing codon-optimized cDNA that is designed to produce full-length, fully functional human RPGR protein inside the eye. We have developed a codon-optimized gene that features higher RPGR protein expression levels than with a wild-type RPGR coding sequence. In addition, codon optimization provides greater sequence stability, which results in the consistent production of an identical protein product. NSR-RPGR is designed to produce RPGR-ORF15, the form of RPGR preferentially expressed in the retina. 
 Based on preclinical findings indicating the potential for safety and efficacy with a significant rescue of photoreceptors, we believe NSR-RPGR has the ability to slow or stop retinal degeneration of photoreceptors and to restore or maintain vision in patients affected by these mutations. In two mouse models of XLRP in which the mice lacked RPGR-ORF15 expression in the retina, treatment with NSR-RPGR resulted in a statistically significant rescue of photoreceptor cell function in the treated eyes, but not in the untreated eyes. A single treatment in both eyes of wild-type mice with NSR-RPGR indicated a favorable safety profile, without inducing any toxic effects. 
 Clinical Development of NSR-RPGR 
 Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study in the XIRIUS Clinical Trial 
 As part of the XIRIUS trial, we are conducting a Phase 1, open-label, dose-ranging, multicenter, single-eye clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NSR-RPGR for the treatment of XLRP in patients with the RPGR mutation. Enrollment of the dose escalation study in the XIRIUS trial was completed in August 2018, consisting of six cohorts of three patients each for a total of 18 adult patients. Patients were enrolled in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Each patient in the trial received a single sub-retinal injection of NSR-RPGR. Doses ranged from 5 × 109  gp in cohort 1 up to 5 × 1011 gp in cohort 6.

On September 22, 2018, we announced positive preliminary safety and efficacy data from the XIRIUS trial for the first five cohorts (combined n=15) of the dose escalation study at the EURETINA medical meeting. Data were presented for each of cohorts 1 through 5 from the one-month follow-up, the latest clinical timepoint for which the complete set of safety and efficacy data was available for all patients. In addition, microperimetry data were presented for cohort 3 through the six-month follow-up visit. 
 Microperimetry
 The chart below provides a retrospective analysis of the results from the Phase 1 dose escalation study at one month, including cohort 6, which became available subsequent to the EURETINA medical meeting. At the one-month follow-up after treatment with NSR-RPGR, all three patients in cohort 3 (5 × 1010 gp), one of three patients in cohort 4 (1 × 1011 gp), one of three patients in cohort 5 (2.5 × 1011 gp), and one of three patients in cohort 6 (5.0x1011 gp) experienced an improvement in microperimetry. A responder has been defined based on interactions with the FDA as an increase of at least 7 dB across at least 5 discrete loci in the central area of the 68-point microperimetry grid. Among the patients in cohorts 4 and 5, improvements in microperimetry in the treated eyes were observed in those patients receiving a second course of steroids. The patients with microperimetry gains also reported subjective visual field improvements in their treated eyes. The safety data and efficacy signals observed in the higher dose groups provided the basis for an early clinical proof of concept for the XIRIUS trial to progress to the Phase 2/3 expansion study further described below. 

* The retrospective analysis is based on difference in sensitivities between baseline and one-month follow-up. A responder has been defined as an increase of at least 7 dB across at least 5 discrete loci in the central area of the 68-point microperimetry grid. One patient in cohort 2 was excluded from the analysis because triplicate testing was not performed at baseline.
 Ellipsoid Zone (EZ) 
 Ellipsoid zone, or EZ, measurements use optical coherence tomography to quantify the extent of undamaged photoreceptors remaining in the retina. No significant decreases in EZ from baseline were observed in patients enrolled in the dose escalation trial through the last follow-up visit for which data were available (ranging from one month in cohort 5 to 12 months in cohort 1). Due to the advanced stage of disease of patients enrolled in this dose escalation study, only three patients (one in cohort 2, one in cohort 5 and one in cohort 6) had a measurable baseline EZ that extended beyond the central 5 degrees of the macula. Prior natural history studies have shown that significant changes in EZ may require at least 1 year to 1.5 years to be detected, with follow-up visits on an annual basis being sufficient to detect progression. We are enrolling patients into the expansion study with higher measurable baseline EZ to allow assessment and correlation of this anatomical endpoint with functional improvements in microperimetry. 
Visual Acuity (VA) 
 VA was assessed in patients enrolled in the dose escalation trial using the clinically validated vision test chart developed for the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study, known as ETDRS. The mean baseline VA for treated eyes in patients in cohorts 1 through 6 
 10

ranged from 28 letters to 71 letters, while the mean baseline VA for untreated eyes ranged from 57 letters to 75 letters, respectively. Despite undergoing macular detachment, mean visual acuity recovered from 57.2±4.3 letters at baseline to 57.3±3.8 by month 1.
 Safety Observations from Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study in the XIRIUS Clinical Trial
 Available safety data from the 18 treated patients in the Phase 1 study indicates that NSR-RPGR was generally well-tolerated. The safety profile in the dose escalation study is generally consistent with that of surgical vitrectomy procedures and what has been observed in clinical trials of other ocular gene therapies. No serious adverse events related to treatment were reported and no early discontinuations or dose limiting toxicity were observed. Mild drug-related inflammation that potentially dampened efficacy was seen in the treated eyes of cohorts 4 through 6, with treatment efficacy observed to have been rescued in a patient who received additional steroid treatment.
 Adverse events of varying severity and duration related to the vitrectomy procedure or drug have been observed in the dose escalation study such as retinal changes, intraocular inflammation and visual disturbances.
 Phase 2/3 Expansion Study in the XIRIUS Clinical Trial
 The ongoing Phase 2/3 expansion study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NSR-RPGR in patients with a diagnosis of XLRP due to RPGR mutations, as confirmed by genetic testing. The primary efficacy endpoint will evaluate changes in retinal sensitivity following treatment with NSR-RPGR. Secondary endpoints include both anatomical and functional endpoints of efficacy and safety similar to those evaluated in the dose escalation study as well as exploratory efficacy endpoints such as mobility maze assessments.
 We expect that approximately 45 patients across surgical centers in both the United States and the United Kingdom will be enrolled. The eligibility criteria for the expansion study include patients with functional impairment as measured by microperimetry and the presence of viable photoreceptors as indicated by ellipsoid zone measurements on optical coherence tomography. Patients will be randomized on a masked basis into one of three study arms: approximately 15 patients receiving a high-dose of NSR-RPGR in one-eye (2.5 × 1011 gp); approximately 15 patients receiving a low-dose of NSR-RPGR in one-eye (5 × 1010 gp); and approximately 15 patients receiving no treatment (no-sham, parallel control arm). The two treatment groups correspond to doses used in cohorts 5 and 3 of the dose escalation study, respectively. Dose selection was based on an overall risk-benefit assessment. The dose corresponding to cohort 6 did not demonstrate additional therapeutic benefit when compared to the dose corresponding to cohort 5. A standardized eight-week steroid regimen is included to maximize any potential treatment benefit.
XOLARIS Natural History Observational Study 
 We are conducting a prospective, natural history observational study, which we refer to as the XOLARIS study, to better understand the progression of untreated XLRP in up to approximately 150 patients. We also believe the study will assist us in identifying a pool of well-characterized patients for subsequent clinical trials of NSR-RPGR. 
 NSR-ABCA4 for the Treatment of Stargardt Disease 
 Our retinal gene therapy product candidate, NSR-ABCA4, is in preclinical development for the treatment of Stargardt disease in patients with mutations in the gene encoding ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A member 4, or ABCA4. Stargardt disease is the most common form of inherited juvenile macular dystrophy, with a prevalence estimated to be approximately one in 10,000 people. The form of Stargardt disease we are targeting is an autosomal recessive disease that is linked to mutations in the ABCA4 gene that are inherited from both parents of an affected individual. The progressive central vision loss associated with Stargardt disease is caused by the degeneration of photoreceptor cells in the central portion of the retina called the macula. Stargardt disease typically develops during childhood and adolescence and can lead to blindness in patients by their twenties. There are no treatments currently available for Stargardt disease. 
 Due to the large size of the ABCA4 cDNA, we have developed a dual vector approach to address the size limitations associated with the AAV packaging capacity based on optimizing the length of DNA overlap between the two vectors. In mouse models of Stargardt disease, NSR-ABCA4 has shown expression of full length ABCA4 protein in photoreceptor outer segments, leading to a significant reduction in toxic metabolic byproducts associated with Stargardt disease. These preclinical results were published in Human Gene Therapy in December 2018.

 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that we believe are important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and our product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. 
 As of December 31, 2018, our intellectual property portfolio consisted of one granted U.S. patent, 17 pending U.S. patent applications, two pending international PCT applications, five granted foreign patents and 51 pending foreign applications. These patent applications include claims directed to methods for treating CHM using NSR-REP1 compositions and to methods for treating retinitis pigmentosa using NSR-RPGR compositions, with expected expiry dates not earlier than between 2032 and 2036. 
 CHM 
 Our CHM intellectual property portfolio includes a family of patent applications licensed from Oxford University Innovation Limited (formerly Isis Innovation Limited), or Oxford. Worldwide filings include national phase applications in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Patent Convention (with a registration in Hong Kong based on this filing), Israel, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore. Claims to NSR-REP1 product and methods of treating CHM have been granted in Australia and claims to the use of NSR-REP1 to treat CHM have been granted in the United States, Europe and Singapore. All pending applications are currently under substantive examination. The U.S. and foreign filings in this family claim priority to a common international PCT application and, if issued, have expected expiry dates not earlier than 2032. 
 We own a PCT application drawn to potency assays for CHM gene therapy based on the administration of NSR-REP1 compositions. Worldwide filings include national phase applications in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, the European Patent Convention (with a registration in Hong Kong), Japan, the Republic of Korea and Singapore. National phase applications claiming priority to this PCT application, if issued, are expected to have expiry dates not earlier than 2037. We jointly own an unpublished PCT application also drawn to potency assays for CHM gene therapy based on the administration of NSR-REP1 compositions. This PCT application is due to enter the national phase in the spring of 2020. National phase applications claiming priority to this PCT application, if issued, are expected to have expiry dates not earlier than 2038.
 13

XLRP 
 Our XLRP intellectual property portfolio includes a family of patent applications licensed from Oxford. Worldwide filings include national phase applications in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Patent Convention (with a registration in Hong Kong), Israel, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia and Singapore. National phase applications claiming priority to this PCT application, if issued, are expected to have expiry dates not earlier than 2036. The pending claims of this PCT application are drawn to products comprising NSR-RPGR and methods of use of NSR-RPGR for treating or preventing retinitis pigmentosa, including XLRP. 
 We own a U.K. patent application drawn to RGPR sequence variants and methods of use of these variants for treating or preventing retinitis pigmentosa, including XLRP. This U.K. priority application was converted into an international PCT application in March 2018. National phase applications claiming priority to this PCT application, if issued, are expected to have expiry dates not earlier than 2038.
 Stargardt Disease 
 Our intellectual property portfolio for Stargardt disease includes a family of patent applications licensed from Oxford. Worldwide filings include national phase applications in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Patent Convention (with an anticipated registration in Hong Kong), Israel, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia and Singapore. National phase applications claiming priority to this PCT application, if issued, are expected to have expiry dates not earlier than 2037. The pending claims of this PCT application are drawn to products comprising NSR-ABCA4 and methods of use of NSR-ABCA4 for treating or preventing Stargardt disease. 
 We jointly own with Oxford a family of U.S. provisional applications drawn to additional ABCA4 sequence constructs and methods of use of these constructs for treating or preventing Stargardt disease. This family of U.S. provisional applications will be converted into an international PCT application in April 2019. National phase applications claiming priority to this PCT application, if issued, are expected to have expiry dates not earlier than 2039. 
 Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our collaborators and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our product candidates or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future product candidates may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties have prepared and filed patent applications prior to March 16, 2013 in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO, to determine priority of invention. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the gene therapy field, are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, significant competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We face substantial competition from many different sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions. 
 We are aware of a number of companies focused on developing gene therapies in various indications, including Abeona Therapeutics Inc., Adverum Biotechnologies Inc., Allergan plc, Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation (AGTC), Audentes Therapeutics, Inc., Avalanche Biotechnologies, Inc., AveXis, Inc., Biogen Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., Editas Medicine, Inc., 4D Molecular Therapeutics, GenSight Biologics S.A., Homology Medicines, Inc., Horama, S.A., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Limelight Bio, Inc., MeiraGTx Limited, Ophthotech Corporation, Oxford Biomedica plc, ProQR Therapeutics N.V., REGENXBIO Inc., the Roche Group, Sanofi S.A., Shire plc, Spark Therapeutics Inc., Ultragenyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and uniQure N.V., as well as several companies addressing other methods for modifying genes and regulating gene expression. Any advances in gene therapy technology made by a competitor may be used to develop therapies that could compete against any of our product candidates. 
 For our specific retinal gene therapy product candidates, the main competitors in clinical development include: 
  
▪ | Choroideremia: Spark Therapeutics is developing SPK-7001, an AAV-based gene therapy for the treatment of CHM, and is currently conducting its first Phase 1/2 clinical trial. 4D Molecular Therapeutics LLC, Roche and Biogen also have preclinical programs in CHM and we believe may be planning to initiate clinical trials in the indication in the next 12 months. On February 25, 2019, The Roche Group announced that it entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Spark Therapeutics.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | X-linked Retinitis Pigmentosa: MeiraGTx, Janssen and AGTC are developing AAV-based gene therapies for the treatment of XLRP and we believe REGENXBIO and other companies may be planning to initiate clinical trials in the future. AGTC and Biogen have published both a stable mutant and a codon-optimized gene capable of producing functional RPGR.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render our potential product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our product candidates against competitors.
 Sales and Marketing
 We hold worldwide commercialization rights to all of our product candidates. Subject to receiving marketing approval, we intend to independently pursue the commercialization of NSR-REP1 in the United States and Europe by building a focused sales and marketing organization in these geographies. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of physicians who are key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed.
 We also plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine.
 Outside of the United States and Europe, we may pursue the approval and commercialization our product candidates either independently or in collaboration with others.
 Manufacturing 
 We believe our current contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, will be able to fully meet our current clinical trial needs, including for our STAR Phase 3 registrational trial, and anticipated future commercial demand for NSR-REP1 in a cost-effective manner, removing the risk typically associated with clinical to commercial scale-up. NSR-REP1 is manufactured using triple transfection of adherent human embryonic kidney 293 cells followed by density gradient centrifugation and chromatographic purification. These process steps have been used successfully to manufacture other gene therapy candidates that have been tested or 
 15

are currently being tested in other clinical trials being conducted by other companies. We have introduced process improvements to make the production and purification processes more robust and compliant with regulatory authority requirements for our Phase 3 clinical trial for NSR-REP1. These improvements included modifications to the master cell bank, transfection agents, plasmid design, chromatography reagents and filtration. In addition, to provide regulatory authorities with additional data on control and monitoring of the NSR-REP1 process and final product, we increased the frequency of in-process testing and the number of quality control release assays. We believe we have alignment with regulators on our cGMP manufacturing process, panel of analytical methods, assay qualifications/validation plans and comparability protocol to support the STAR trial, as well as the potential commercialization of NSR-REP1. Clinical drug supply of NSR-REP1 for our ISTs to date and of NSR-RPGR for our Phase 1 clinical trial was manufactured by the Viral Vector Core and Clinical Manufacturing Facility of the Nationwide Children’s Hospital, or NCH, in compliance with cGMP. 
 We also believe our CMOs have sufficient capacity to meet demand for our pipeline of retinal gene therapy product candidates for our future clinical trials and anticipated commercial demand. Additionally, we will work with our CMOs to develop and validate manufacturing process improvements that may increase the productivity, compliance and efficiency of our manufacturing technology employed in the existing process and to reduce risk in our manufacturing supply chain. 
 Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biologic products including gene therapy products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and regulations and guidance implementing these laws. The FDCA, PHSA and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biologic products. Investigational new drug applications, or INDs, to the FDA are required before conducting human clinical testing of biologic products. Additionally, each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product candidate is reviewed by the FDA and, in limited instances the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, through its Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of biologic products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals. 
 Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Tissue and Advanced Therapies and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. CBER works closely with the NIH and the RAC, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. Although the FDA has only approved a limited number of human gene therapy products for sale, it has provided guidance for the development of gene therapy products. This guidance includes a growing body of guidance documents on Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, or CMC, clinical investigations and other areas of gene therapy development, all of which are intended to facilitate the industry’s development of gene therapy products. 
 Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products or product candidates are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 U.S. Biologic Products Development Process 
 Although certain human cellular and tissue-based products that meet specified criteria are regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and are not subject to premarket approval requirements, FDA has determined that gene therapy products do not meet those criteria and thus are subject to approval as biological products under section 351 of the PHSA.  Consequently, our gene therapy product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

▪ | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which allows human clinical trials to begin unless FDA objects within 30 days;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 16

 
▪ | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA regulations relating to good clinical practice or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval, also referred to as “licensure”, that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | payment of user fees and FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, including a gene therapy product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 If a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research have, until recently, been subject to requirements set forth in the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or the NIH Guidelines.  Although, as explained below, the NIH recently placed a temporary moratorium on these requirements while the NIH considers potential changes, the NIH Guidelines require that prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documents must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or the OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or the NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines has, until recently, been mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA. However, many companies and other institutions, not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines, voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the RAC that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public. 
 On August 16, 2018, NIH released a proposal for public comment to amend the NIH Guidelines to streamline oversight of human gene therapy research protocols and reduce duplicative reporting requirements.  Specifically, NIH proposed removing the NIH protocol submission, review, and reporting requirements under Appendix M of the NIH Guidelines.  NIH also proposed to modify the role and responsibilities of the RAC.  In releasing the proposal, NIH also announced that during the comment period and effective immediately, NIH will no longer accept new human gene therapy protocols for the protocol registration process under the NIH Guidelines, or convene the RAC to review individual protocols.  NIH also explained that it will not accept annual reports, safety reports, amendments, or other documentation for any previously registered human gene transfer protocol.  The roles and responsibilities of Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs) at the local level would, however, continue as described in the NIH Guidelines.
 The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. As noted above, the NIH has announced a temporary moratorium on the 
 17

RAC review requirement for gene therapy clinical trials. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. 
 Human Clinical Trials Under an IND 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators which generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. 
 Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or their legal representative, reviews and approves the trial protocol, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials involving recombinant DNA also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research that utilizes recombinant DNA at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 
 Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
▪ | Phase 1. The biologic product candidate initially is introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. Phase 1 clinical trials of gene therapies are typically conducted in patients rather than healthy volunteers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Phase 2. The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” trials, which typically denotes a trial which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a biologic product. In Phase 3 clinical trials, the biologic product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the potency and safety of the product for approval. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. In some cases, conducting a post-approval study to confirm or further refine the safety, efficacy or optimal use of a product may be a condition of approval of a product.
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. 
 Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; any findings from other trials; findings from animal or in vivo laboratory tests or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report as soon as possible, but in no 
 18

case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but no later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. 
 The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Additional Regulation for Gene Therapy Clinical Trials 
 In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. 
 The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene therapy trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these clinical trials. 
 Compliance with cGMP Requirements 
 Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA typically will not approve a BLA unless it determines through a preapproval inspection that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specification. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 The results of the preclinical tests and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s CMC and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. 
 For gene therapies, selecting patients with applicable genetic defects is a necessary condition to effective treatment. For the therapy we are currently developing, we believe that diagnoses based on existing genetic tests developed and administered by laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, are sufficient to select appropriate patients and will be permitted by the FDA. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. The PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug program fee for each prescription drug product that is identified in a human drug application, up to a maximum of five prescription drug program fees per 
 19

fiscal year for products identified in a single approved application. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA reviews a BLA within 60 days of submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In that event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth, substantive review of the BLA. 
 The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA generally will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND requirements and GCP requirements. 
 On the basis of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter if the agency determines the product meets the standards for approval. 
 If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biologic product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs under the PDUFA. One such goal is to review standard BLAs in ten months after the FDA accepts the BLA for filing, and priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. To be eligible for priority review, a product candidate must receive such a designation based on meeting certain specified statutory standards (e.g., intended to treat a serious condition and would provide significant improvement in safety or effectiveness if approved) or the sponsor must have obtained a priority review voucher from another sponsor whose product candidate qualified for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a biologic product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biologic product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. In addition, if a sponsor seeks orphan designation for a drug or biological product for a disease or condition that meets the 200,000 prevalence criteria but the product is considered the “same drug” as a previously approved drug or biological product, to be eligible for orphan designation the sponsor must provide a plausible hypothesis that its drug or biological product is clinically superior to the previously approved same drug.  After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent, its 
 20

potential orphan use, and the identity of the sponsor, are disclosed publicly by the FDA on the agency’s website. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If an orphan-designated product is the first to obtain FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, meaning that FDA has not previously approved a drug or biological product considered to be the “same drug” as that drug or biological product for the same orphan disease or condition, the product is entitled to a seven year period of orphan product exclusivity.  During an orphan exclusivity period, FDA may not approve any other applications to market the “same drug”, as that term is defined in FDA regulations, for the same orphan-protected indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as if the sponsor of a subsequent same drug is able to show that its product is clinically superior to the product with orphan exclusivity or if the party holding the exclusivity fails to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated.  Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products not considered the “same drug” as the orphan-protected drug or biological product for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for a product considered the “same drug” but for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. 
 If an orphan-designated drug or biological product is considered the same as a previously approved same drug that does not have unexpired orphan exclusivity, while a showing of clinical superiority is not required in order for the subsequent drug or biological product to receive marketing approval for the same orphan indication as the previously approved same drug, a demonstration of clinical superiority is nonetheless required for the subsequent drug or biological to upon approval be eligible for its own 7-year orphan exclusivity period. 
 Orphan medicinal product status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits. For example, the European Union grants ten years of product exclusivity for orphan medicinal products. 
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the PPACA, which was signed into law in March 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. The BPCIA established an abbreviated pathway for the licensure of biosimilar and interchangeable versions of reference biological products licensed under the PHSA.  The BPCIA authorizes the FDA to approve under section 351(k) of the PHSA biosimilar and interchangeable biologics that reference biological products approved under section 351(a) of the PHSA. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars and interchangeable biologics.  Additional guidance is expected to be finalized by the FDA in the near term.
 Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.”  In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must make certain findings including that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.  For the FDA to approve a biological product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that (i) the biological product is biosimilar to the reference product, (ii) the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient, and (iii) for products administered multiple times, that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 BLA-approved products can potentially be eligible for a 12-year period of reference product exclusivity.  Under section 351(k)(7) of the PHSA, as amended by the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable biological product referencing an approved reference biological product may not be submitted to the FDA for review until four years following the date of first licensure of the reference product, and section 351(k)(7) prohibits approval of the application for the biosimilar or interchangeable product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed.  Not every product approved through a BLA is eligible for reference product exclusivity, but, rather, eligibility turns on whether licensure of a product is considered a “first licensure”.  As FDA has interpreted the reference product exclusivity provisions of the BPCIA in draft guidance, applications for certain changes to previously licensed biological products from the same or certain related sponsors are not considered the dates of first licensure for purposes of giving rise to a period of reference product exclusivity.   
 Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if they submit and obtain approval through section 351(a) of the PHSA of a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of their product.  The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for approval of the first interchangeable product referencing a particular reference product during which FDA cannot approve an application for another interchangeable product relying on the same reference product.  At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily 
 21

substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.  In addition, because the BPCIA was enacted as part of the ACA, at this juncture, it is also unclear whether and how the abbreviated pathway established by the BPCIA will be affected by legal challenges to the ACA, including a December 2018 ruling in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas finding the ACA unconstitutional, which is currently stayed pending appeal.
 Pediatric Exclusivity
 Under the BPCIA, biologics, such as our product candidates, may be eligible for pediatric exclusivity, an incentive intended to encourage medical product research for children. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods applicable to biological products under the BPCIA—namely, the four-year period during which the FDA will not consider an application for a biosimilar product, and the 12-year period during which the FDA will not approve a biosimilar application.  If a biological product has unexpired orphan exclusivity, the orphan exclusivity is also eligible for a 6-month pediatric exclusivity extension.  This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of these exclusivity protection periods, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “written request” for such a trial.
Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a biologic product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Biologic products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, regenerative medicine advance therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval. 
  
▪ | Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives: intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and a rolling review.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Regenerative Medicine Advance Therapy (RMAT) designation. RMAT was introduced as a new designation under the 21st Century Cures Act for the development and review of certain regenerative medicine therapies. As set forth in section 506(g)(8) of the FDCA, the term “regenerative medicine therapy” is defined to include cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under section 361 of the PHSA. To receive RMAT designation, a regenerative medicine product candidate must be intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition with preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical need. RMAT designation does not require evidence to indicate that the drug may offer a substantial improvement over available therapies, as breakthrough designation requires. In November 2017, the FDA released draft guidance that clarified that gene therapies, including genetically modified cells, that lead to a durable modification of cells or tissues, may meet the definition of a regenerative medicine therapy for RMAT designation. Similar to breakthrough designation, an RMAT product candidate receives: intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and a rolling review. Regenerative medicine therapies that quality for RMAT designation may also quality for other FDA expedited programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, and priority review designation, if they meet the criteria for such programs. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Accelerated approval. Drugs or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, for accelerated approval products FDA typically requires pre-
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22

 
dissemination submission of promotional materials to FDA for the agency’s consideration. A drug approved under the accelerated approval pathway may have its approval revoked on several grounds including if a required post-approval trial fails to verify clinical benefit or does not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Post-approval Requirements 
 Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biologic products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biologic products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA, together with a release protocol, showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biologic products. 
 A sponsor also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”). Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product, withdrawal of the product from the market, withdrawal of the BLA approval, as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal actions and adverse publicity. These actions could include refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, suspension or termination of a clinical trial by an IRB, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines or other monetary penalties, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare providers, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or other civil or criminal penalties. 
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of product candidates, some of a sponsor’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period generally is one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biologic product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. Moreover, a given patent may only be extended once based on a single product. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. Because PTE has generally been interpreted by courts to extend patent protection to a drug’s “active ingredient” and that concept generally has not been applied to large molecule biological products, there is currently some uncertainty as to how PTE protection will apply to reference biological products to protect against biosimilar products that might have minor structural differences from the reference product.
Government Regulation Outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject, either directly or through third parties, to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved. In the European Union, the requirements, regulatory approvals and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country, though there is some degree of European Union-wide harmonization. 
 23

Regulation in the European Union 
 In the European Union, medicinal products, including advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by regulatory authorities at both the European Union and national levels. ATMPs comprise gene therapy products, somatic cell therapy products and tissue engineered products, which are cells or tissues that have undergone substantial manipulation so that biological characteristics, physiological functions or structural properties relevant for the intended regeneration, repair or replacement are achieved and that the cells or tissues are not intended to be used for the same essential function or functions in the recipient as in the donor. We anticipate that our gene therapy development products would be regulated as ATMPs in the European Union in view of its method of manufacture and mode of use that involves administration of genetic sequences to treat a clinical condition. 
 Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with the harmonized European Union laws and rules as directly applicable to EU Member States and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on Good Clinical Practices, or GCP. Additional seeking to implement EU laws issued by the European Commission in Volume 10 of the Rules governing medicinal products, apply also to clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the European Union, it must appoint an entity within the European Union to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most European Union countries, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial. 
 Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee. The application for a clinical trial authorization must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Currently, clinical trial authorization applications must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU Member State in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is currently expected to come into operation in October 2018, there will be a “coordinated” application procedure where one national authority takes the lead, as the “reporting member state”, in reviewing the application, taking account of the comments provided by the national authorities of the member states which are concerned by the application. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications affecting the initial approval must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees.  Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Other national and European Union-wide regulatory requirements also apply. 
 During the development of a medicinal product, the EMA and national medicines regulators within the European Union provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of a request for scientific advice or protocol assistance for an orphan medicinal product, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure. However, waiver or reduction of the fee may be granted by the EMA Secretariat in specific circumstances such as that the request is made by an applicant which is designated as a small, medium sized enterprise or the product is designated as an orphan medicinal product.  Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future marketing authorization application of the product concerned. 
 Marketing Authorizations 
 In order to market a new medicinal product in the European Union, a company must submit an application for marketing authorization or MAA with a view to obtaining a marketing authorization from a EU regulatory authority . The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product. 
 The centralized procedure results in a single marketing authorization, or MA, granted by the European Commission that is valid across the EEA (i.e., the European Union as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway through the EEA Treaty). The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as those that involves a recombinant DNA technology, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) officially designated orphan medicines and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases. Therefore, the centralized procedure would be mandatory for the products we are developing as advanced therapy medicinal products. 
 The Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, is statutorily responsible in conjunction with the CHMP for the evaluation of ATMPs. The CAT is primarily responsible for the scientific evaluation of ATMPs and prepares a draft opinion on the quality, safety and efficacy of each ATMP for which a marketing authorization application is submitted. The CAT’s opinion is then taken into 
 24

account by the CHMP when giving its final recommendation regarding the authorization of an advanced therapy medicinal product based on the balance of benefits and risks identified. Although the CAT’s draft opinion is submitted to the CHMP for final approval, the CHMP based on its own independent benefit/risk assessment may depart from the draft opinion provided by CAT. The CHMP and CAT are also responsible for providing scientific guidelines on ATMPs and have published numerous such guidelines, including specific guidelines on gene therapies and cell therapies. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of ATMPs and include, among other things, the preclinical studies required to characterize ATMPs; the manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a marketing authorization application; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long term efficacy and potential adverse reactions of ATMPs. Although these guidelines are not legally binding, we believe that our compliance with them is likely necessary to gain and maintain approval for any of our product candidates. 
 Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days. This excludes the so-called clock stops to afford the applicant sufficient time to address questions asked by the CHMP and for an application relating to an advanced therapy medicinal product, CAT. At the end of the review period, the CHMP provides an opinion to the European Commission. If this is opinion favorable, the Commission may then adopt a binding decision to grant an MA. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of an MAA in no more than 150 days. This is usually when the product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. However, the shortened time-frame for an accelerated review may be reverted to the full review procedure of 210 days if the CHMP identifies significant concerns relating to the quality of the dossier in its initial assessment in order to ensure that the applicant is given the full opportunity to address the issues identified. 
 The European Commission may grant a so-called “marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances.” Such authorization is intended for products for which the applicant can demonstrate that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided, or it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information. Consequently, marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances may be granted subject to certain specific obligations, which may include the following: 
  
▪ | the applicant must complete an identified program of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case of a radio-pharmaceutical, by an authorized person; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | the package leaflet and any medical information must draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particulars available concerning the medicinal product in question are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is subject to review to reassess the risk-benefit balance in light of information generated from an agreed program of post-authorization specific measures or studies The CHMP may recommend the marketing authorization to be varied, suspended or revoked if such regulatory measure is justified based on new data relevant to benefit/risk balance of the product. The renewal of a marketing authorization of a medicinal product under exceptional circumstances, however, follows the same rules as a “normal” marketing authorization. Thus, a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is granted for an initial five years, after which the authorization will become valid indefinitely, unless the EMA decides that safety grounds merit one additional five-year renewal. 
 The European Commission may also grant a so-called “conditional marketing authorization” provided that the applicant is able to furnish the comprehensive clinical data to confirm a positive benefit/risk assessment with a view to supporting grant of a full marketing authorization. Such conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products), if (i) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (iii) the product fulfills an unmet medical need and (iv) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. 
 The European Union medicines rules expressly permit the EU Member States to adopt national legislation prohibiting or restricting the sale, supply or use of any medicinal product containing, consisting of or derived from a specific type of human or animal cell, such 
 25

as embryonic stem cells. While the products we have in development do not make use of embryonic stem cells, it is possible that the national laws in certain EU Member States may prohibit or restrict us from commercializing our products, even if they have been granted an EU marketing authorization. 
 Data Exclusivity 
 Marketing authorization applications for generic medicinal products do not need to include the results of preclinical and clinical trials, but instead can refer to the data contain in the marketing authorization of a reference product for which regulatory data exclusivity or protection has expired to inform the overall benefit/risk assessment of the generic product. If a marketing authorization is granted for a medicinal product containing a new active substance, that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic marketing authorization applications referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market protection, during which such generic products may not be placed on the market. The 10-year protection period may be extended cumulatively to 11 years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication which is considered to bring significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. 
 There is a special regime for authorizing biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw or source materials used for manufacture or manufacturing processes. An application for marketing authorization for a biosimilar product may be accepted only after the basic regulatory data protection of the reference product has expired. However, for such products, the biosimilar manufacturer is required to submit the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials according to the guidelines adopted by the EMA that detail the type of supplementary data necessary to support an assessment of comparability between the biosimilar product and the reference product. There are currently no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be approved in the European Union. However, guidance from the EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory experience gained at the time. 
Orphan Medicinal Products 
 The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, may recommend orphan medicinal product designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the product in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. The COMP may only recommend orphan medicinal product designation when the product in question offers a significant clinical benefit over existing approved products for the relevant indication. Following a positive opinion by the COMP, the European Commission adopts a decision granting orphan status. The COMP will reassess orphan status in parallel with EMA review of a marketing authorization application and orphan status may be withdrawn at that stage if it no longer fulfills the orphan criteria (for instance because in the meantime a new product was approved for the indication and no convincing data are available to demonstrate a significant benefit over that product). Orphan medicinal product designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity attaching to the granted marketing authorization. During this period, the competent authorities may not accept or approve any similar medicinal product, unless it is shown to be clinically superior in terms of clinical efficacy, clinical safety or otherwise a major contribution to patient care. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan medicinal product designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
Pediatric Development 
 In the European Union, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree a Paediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, with the EMA and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that agreed PIP, unless a waiver applies, (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). The marketing authorization application for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Products that are granted a marketing authorization on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. Extension of such exclusivity applies if the study data are provided in compliance with the agreed PIP, notwithstanding that the agreed PIP fails to lead to the authorization of a paediatric indication, but the results of the studies conducted are reflected in the summary of product characteristics and, if appropriate, in the package leaflet of the medicinal product concerned. However, EU law prohibits “double benefits” in the sense of a claim for both six-month extension of a supplementary protection certificate and two-year extension of orphan market exclusivity.

In the EU, Regulation 1049/2001/EC, commonly known as the EU Freedom of Information Regulation or Public Access Regulation, confers rights on any EU citizens and any natural or legal persons residing or having their headquarters in an EU country to request access to the documents held by a EU institution on grounds relating to public interest. However, access to such documents is subject to conditions provided in the Regulation and the exceptions laid out therein. It applies to all documents held by an EU institution, including documents drawn up or received by it and in its possession, in all areas of European Union (EU) activity. The Regulation applies to the EMA which has implemented the provisions in its established policy. The EMA policy essentially favors public access subject to certain limited exceptions if disclosure undermines, among others, the protection of commercial interests. The EMA policy has been the subject of four recent rulings of the European General Court in the following cases: Pari Pharma GmbH v EMA (Case T-235/1); MSD Animal Health Innovation and Intervet International v EMA(Case T-729/15) PTC Therapeutics International v EMA (Case T-718/15); Amicus Therapeutics UK Ltd and another v EMA (Case T-33/17). These decisions essentially respond to demands for greater transparency and disclosure of pre-clinical and clinical data. They also validate the EMA’s transparency policy to provide greater public access to information held and documents drawn up by the EMA. 
 Our products currently in development are advanced therapy medicinal products which will be subject to mandatory Centralized assessment. In light of the European General Court’s decisions, information held by the EMA concerning the marketing authorization application and responses provided by the applicant, preliminary assessment reports drawn up by the EMA and its advisory committees would likely be susceptible to disclosure to third parties, including a competitor, once a decision on the approvability of our products is made and the application is withdrawn from the centralized procedure, subject to an assessment of whether one of the exceptions provided in the Public Access Regulation. 
 Moreover, in 2014, the EMA adopted a policy on the proactive publication of clinical data (not pre-clinical data) supporting Centralized Marketing Authorizations, known as “Policy 70” (Policy/0070 EMA/240810/2013 (2 October 2014)). This was in response to a call from researchers and academics for greater transparency of clinical data. The policy applies to any new applications for Centralized Marketing Authorization made after January 1, 2015, and for extension of indication and line extension applications for Centralized Authorizations made after July 1, 2015. It does not apply to clinical data submitted before these dates. Nor does Policy 70 apply to applications made to national authorities which will be subject to the national freedom of information laws.
 Under the policy, after the EMA takes its decision, the clinical data within the application dossier (whether the study is conducted within the EU or outside) will be available on the EMA’s website (see EMA: Clinical data) at the same time as publication of the EPAR. The disclosure will occur after the EMA’s “decision”, which includes not only a decision on grant of the authorization, but also refusal or withdrawal of the application. The policy is stated to cover such data, but there is a question as to whether this may undermine a company’s strategy for further research and development, and the re-submission of the data to support an authorization.
 Post-Approval Controls 
 The holder of a marketing authorization must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, or QPPV, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs. 
 All new marketing authorization applications must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions. 
 All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each EU Member State and can differ from one country to another. 
 Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Governments influence the price of medicinal products in the European Union through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. 
 Decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products in the European Union are governed by national rules subject to the control of the requirements set out in the Transparency Directive (Council Directive 89/105/EEC). The Transparency Directive aims to ensure transparency of measures established by EU Member States to control pricing and reimbursement of medicinal product. The Directive defines a series of procedural requirements designed to verify that national pricing and reimbursement decisions do not 
 27

create obstacles to the pharmaceutical trade within the EU's Internal Market. Subject to the control of the Transparency Directive, there is no binding policy at the EU level governing pricing and reimbursement, and the 28 EU Member States each have their own, often varying, approaches and policies such to manage healthcare costs based on such measures as price control, profit control, international price comparisons, and reference pricing.
 Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Some Member States may impose statutory rebates or discounts to manage healthcare costs. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. 
 For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the other applicable regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations 
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and use of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors, existing or potential customers and referral sources, including healthcare providers, are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, and these laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which manufacturers conduct clinical research, market, sell and distribute the products for which they obtain marketing approval. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following: 

▪ | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or kind, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual for, or the furnishing, recommendation, purchase, lease or order of a good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under federal or state healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and patients, among others, on the other. Remuneration is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted by regulators to include for example, cash payments, gifts, discounts, coupons, and the furnishing of free or discounted services or supplies. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) interprets the Anti-Kickback Statute to cover any arrangement where one purpose of the remuneration is to induce or reward referrals of business. Under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | the federal civil or criminal false claims and civil monetary laws, including the civil False Claims Act, or the FCA, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from the federal government that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, also may implicate the FCA. There is also a separate false claims provision imposing criminal penalties. In addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and similar state laws, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or the CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, certain other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary's selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 28

 
▪ | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and falsifying or concealing a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the transmission, security and privacy of protected health information by entities subject to HIPAA, such as health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, and their respective business associates that access protected health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | the Criminal Healthcare Fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. Other federal criminal law sections prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for federal healthcare benefits, items or services; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state transparency and price reporting laws aimed at containing or reducing payment levels for prescription pharmaceuticals paid for in whole or in part with state government funds; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Violation of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, individual imprisonment, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if a person or entity becomes subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Furthermore, efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly for manufacturers of branded prescription products. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of any product candidates for which regulatory approval for commercial sale is obtained will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities and health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. The process for a payor to determine whether it will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit broad coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of U.S. federal and state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products or biologics. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our approved products as part of their plans’ benefits, or could impose utilization management restrictions, high patient cost-sharing obligations, or restrict the level of reimbursement, which may affect whether we can sell our products on a profitable basis. 
 A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that the product will have an adequate reimbursement rate by that payor. Further, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for a product, it may be 
 29

necessary to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate to payors the benefits and cost-effectiveness of the products. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, it is possible that they may not cover the product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. 
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 In addition, in the United States, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set list prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, contain the cost of drugs, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs, and reform government healthcare program reimbursement methodologies. At the federal level, there have been several U.S. Congressional inquiries, proposed bills, and proposed administrative rules designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Although the outcome and potential effect of these proposals is unclear, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. EU Member States may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Furthermore, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements. 
 Health Reform 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs. 
 By way of example, in March 2010, the PPACA was signed into law, intended to broaden access to health insurance, increase consumer insurance protection, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries,  and impose taxes and fees on the healthcare industry, while reducing the cost of healthcare for consumers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of importance to our business are: 
  
▪ | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

▪ | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (and 70% starting January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the PPACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will, due to subsequent legislation, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or BBA, remain in effect through 2027 unless additional congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Further, since enactment of the PPACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, recent tax legislation that removed the financial penalties for people who do not carry health insurance (known as the “individual mandate”) and an Executive Order signed in October 2017 by President Trump directing federal agencies to modify how the ACA is implemented and announced that his administration will withhold the cost-sharing subsidies paid to health insurance exchange plans serving low-income enrollees. Congress may continue to consider legislation to repeal and replace some or all elements of the ACA. Additionally, a federal court in Texas ruled in December 2018 that the entire ACA is unconstitutional. Although that ruling is being appealed, we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation, including a possible decision by the United States Supreme Court, and there is still uncertainty whether the ACA will undergo additional revisions.  We cannot predict the impact of any future modifications.
 There have been, and likely will continue to be, additional legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal, and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
 We expect that these initiatives, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or any other government-funded program may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates. 
 Additional Regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biologic, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other countries that impose similar obligations. 
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or secure any improper advantage, or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any employee or official of a foreign government or public international organization, or political party, political party official, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The scope of the FCPA also includes employees and officials of state-
 31

owned or controlled enterprises, which may include healthcare professionals in many countries. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other foreign countries that impose similar obligations, such as the Bribery Act 2010 in the UK.
