Our principal PLM products are described below.
Our Windchill® suite of PLM software provides product lifecycle management capabilities - from design to service. Windchill offers a single repository for all product information. As such, it is designed to create a “single source of truth” for all product-related content such as CAD models, documents, technical illustrations, embedded software, calculations and requirement specifications for all phases of the product lifecycle to help companies streamline enterprise-wide communication and make informed decisions.Additionally, our Windchill product family includes solutions that allow manufacturers, distributors and retailers to collaborate across product development and the supply chain, including sourcing and procurement, to identify an optimal set of parts, materials and suppliers. This functionality provides automated cost modeling and visibility into supply chain risk information to balance cost and quality, and enables customers to design products that meet compliance requirements and performance targets.With Windchill 11.1, we introduced augmented reality (AR) capabilities to Windchill customers. This cloud dependent functionality enables customers to build a digital product definition and publish the representation of the resulting product in AR. Using AR in the product development process enables companies to connect the digital model to the physical product to determine real-time behavior, conduct product design reviews in real-world environments, and share the product definition with disparate stakeholders.

Our Markets and How We Address Them
We compete in the Industrial IoT (IIoT) and augmented reality markets and the CAD and PLM markets. The markets we serve present different growth opportunities for us. We see greater opportunity for market growth for our IIoT and Augmented Reality solutions for the enterprise, followed by more moderate market growth for our CAD and PLM solutions. 
We derive most of our sales from products and services sold directly by our sales force to end-user customers. Approximately 20% to 30% of our sales of products and services are through third-party resellers and other strategic partners. Our sales force focuses on large accounts, while our reseller channel provides a cost-effective means of covering the small- and medium-size business market. Our strategic services partners provide service offerings to help customers implement our product offerings. As we grow our IIoT business, we expect our go-to-market strategy will rely more on partners, including the types of strategic partners described above, and marketing directly to end users and developers.
