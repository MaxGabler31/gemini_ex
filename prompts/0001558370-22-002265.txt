ITEM 1: Business.
Overview
​
Our mission is to accelerate electric vehicle adoption and to be a catalyst in the transition of commercial fleets to all-electric vehicles for a more sustainable future. We are an electric vehicle (“EV”) innovator focused on developing high-quality light-duty work vehicles. We believe we are one of the only North American light duty original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) focused solely on EVs for commercial fleet customers. We believe the large commercial fleet market presents a unique opportunity to target with vehicles designed specifically for the needs of these customers. We are implementing a strategy designed to accelerate the launch of new commercial EVs. This includes working on our own vehicle programs as well as partnering with third parties as we seek to leverage our experience, our proprietary and open-source technologies and our

existing vehicle platform to more efficiently develop and launch electric vehicles, to enhance capital efficiency and achieve profitability sooner.
​
Since inception, we have been developing our flagship vehicle, the Endurance™, an electric full-size pickup truck. We are building pre-production vehicles (“PPV”) for testing, validation, certification, and regulatory approvals during the first half of 2022. Subject to raising sufficient capital, completion of the transactions under the Asset Purchase Agreement with Foxconn (discussed below), and satisfactory completion of testing and receipt of regulatory approvals, we expect commercial production and sales of the Endurance to begin in the third quarter of 2022. We intend to leverage our advanced technologies and highly talented team to develop additional all-electric vehicles targeted for the commercial market.
​
In November 2019 we acquired the 6.2 million square feet Lordstown, Ohio assembly complex from General Motors (“GM”). The facility was in a near-production-ready state, with manufacturing lines and equipment already in place. Since acquiring the plant we have hired more than 430 employees to work in the facility, many of whom were long tenured former GM employees at the Lordstown facility. We have invested approximately $173 million through December 31, 2021 to facilitate the conversion of the plant from manufacturing a high-volume internal combustion engine passenger car to an advanced full-size EV pickup truck plant. Our investments include purchasing the equipment necessary to scale manufacturing and assemble hub motors and battery packs. We have also hired highly experienced new executives, engineering and broader corporate talent to help us execute our plan. These new personnel bring proven track records executing large scale vehicle launches, extensive experience in automotive design and engineering as well as operational and strategic know-how to lead our organization through our transformation and into the future.
​
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we entered into agreements with affiliates of Hon Hai Technology Group (“Foxconn”), as described below, that would result in more than $280 million in funding for the Company, if consummated. We have already received $200 million from Foxconn as of January 28, 2022 in the form of down payments under the Asset Purchase Agreement and for the purchase of our Class A common stock. 
​
On November 10, 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “APA” or “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Foxconn EV Technology, Inc., an Ohio corporation (“Foxconn Ohio”). Pursuant to the APA, Foxconn Ohio will purchase the Lordstown facility for $230 million and reimburse certain operating and expansion costs incurred by us from September 1, 2021 through the closing. We would continue to own our hub motor assembly line, as well as our battery module and packing line assets, certain intellectual property rights and other excluded assets. We expect to outsource all of the manufacturing of the Endurance to Foxconn with the sale of our Lordstown facility, including the operation of the assets we continue to own in the facility after closing under a Contract Manufacturing Agreement (defined under “—Foxconn Transactions” below). As noted above, Foxconn Ohio has made down payments of the purchase price of $100 million on November 18, 2021 and $50 million on January 28, 2022. Foxconn Ohio is required to make an additional down payment of $50 million no later than April 15, 2022, subject to certain conditions. The balance of the purchase price, along with reimbursement of certain operating and expansion costs would be paid at closing. If the APA is terminated or if the transaction does not close prior to the later of (i) April 30, 2022 and (ii) 10 days after the transaction is cleared by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”), we are obligated to repay the down payments to Foxconn. We have granted Foxconn a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the repayment obligation. In addition to the $150 million in down payments under the APA, we issued $50 million of our Class A common stock to Foxconn at a price of $6.8983 per share on October 12, 2021, pursuant to a separate subscription agreement. The APA is subject to certain conditions and has not been consummated as of the date of the filing of this report. No assurance can be made that it will ultimately be consummated on the terms contemplated, or at all. 
​
The transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement (“Foxconn Transactions”) and other potential relationships with Foxconn (see Part I – Item 1. Business —Foxconn Transactions), if achieved, would represent a shift in our business strategy from a fully vertically integrated designer, developer and manufacturer of EVs into a less capital-intensive business focused on developing, engineering, testing and 

5



industrializing vehicles in partnership with Foxconn. The sale of the Lordstown facility would allow us to meaningfully reduce our operating complexity and fixed cost structure by transferring to Foxconn the current and future manufacturing employees along with fixed overhead costs, such as maintenance, utilities, insurance and more. Foxconn is one of the world’s largest manufacturers with unique experience scaling operations and an announced strategy to establish a presence in the global EV market. We believe that outsourcing our manufacturing to a highly qualified partner would enable us to leverage Foxconn’s technology, supply chain network and expertise to accelerate the launch of current and future vehicle programs. Furthermore, we believe we would realize the benefits of scaled manufacturing sooner as Foxconn contracts with other OEMs to produce their vehicles in the Lordstown facility. 
​
Under the APA, the parties agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a joint venture agreement for the purpose of jointly designing, engineering, developing, validating and launching vehicle programs for the commercial vehicle market in North America and internationally using Foxconn’s Mobility-in-Harmony (“MIH”) platform. The MIH platform will allow multiple OEMs to create a variety of electric vehicle types using a shared hardware and software architecture and manufacturing process. The sharing of these foundational subsystems, components, and processes is expected to enable new vehicles to be brought to market faster and at a lower cost, aligning with our mission to accelerate electric vehicle development and adoption.
​
We are actively discussing establishing a joint product development agreement with Foxconn, under which we would seek to use the MIH platform to develop a portfolio of electric vehicles targeting our commercial fleet customers to be built at the Lordstown, Ohio plant. If successful, we anticipate that Foxconn would also supply certain vehicle components and subsystems for newly developed vehicles, enabling us to leverage Foxconn’s manufacturing experience, supply-chain network and extensive experience in software development and integration (key capabilities in the production of EVs) to complement our EV design, development, engineering and homologation contributions. 
​
We believe that any joint product development agreement with Foxconn would also need to incorporate an appropriate funding structure that enables us to raise the additional capital necessary to bring the Endurance into production as well as fund new vehicle development. We continue to explore all financing alternatives as we will need substantial funding to execute our operating plan that is anticipated to use significant capital for the foreseeable future.
​
No assurance can be made that the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, including the Contract Manufacturing Agreement, the Lordstown Facility Lease, a joint product development agreement, any additional funding arrangements or other agreements will ultimately be consummated on the terms contemplated, or at all, or that they will provide the anticipated benefits. Even if the Foxconn Transactions are consummated in accordance with the current terms and on the anticipated timeline, we will need additional funding to continue our development efforts and maintain our current plans and timeline for commercial production. See Part I - Item 1. Business —Foxconn Transactions and Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks associated with the Foxconn Transactions and other related agreements being contemplated, including a joint product development agreement, and our need to raise additional capital.
​
Our Strengths and Strategy
​
We seek to capture a meaningful share of the commercial fleet electric vehicle market and intend to do so by focusing on the following strengths:
​

● | Near-production-ready plant to build electric vehicles and strategic location. The Lordstown facility is one of the largest automotive assembly plants in North America and is in a near-production-ready state. We acquired the plant for approximately $45 million and have invested approximately $173 million as of December 31, 2021 to facilitate the conversion of the plant from manufacturing a high-volume internal combustion engine passenger car, to an advanced full-size EV pickup truck
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

plant. The Foxconn Transactions would result in the sale of the plant for $230 million. We anticipate a substantial gain on the sale of the plant, as the $173 million of investments in the facility as of December 31, 2021 include our large investments in our battery and in-wheel hub motor lines that are not being sold to Foxconn. Completion of the sale would allow us to generate liquidity at a premium to our investment, partner with Foxconn, and reduce our operating complexity and fixed cost structure. As a condition to the closing of the transaction, we plan to enter into a Contract Manufacturing Agreement to outsource to Foxconn the continued production of the Endurance at the plant. The Lordstown facility is strategically located in Lordstown, Ohio, near the major interstate highway between Cleveland, Ohio, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Lordstown, Ohio, and the surrounding area is home to a highly trained workforce with experience manufacturing vehicles, as well as an extensive automotive supply base.

​

● | The Endurance has a unique and efficient design featuring proven in-wheel hub motor, battery pack and powertrain technologies. The technology and engineering developed by us to date have led to operational prototype, beta and pre-production vehicles that have been or are being tested to meet commercial fleet performance standards and regulatory requirements. The design of the Endurance features in-wheel hub motors, that eliminate the need for many parts found in both traditional and existing electric vehicles. In addition, the in-wheel hub motors contribute to the Endurance’s advanced traction handling and maneuverability, features that are important to commercial fleet customers. As a result, we believe that the Endurance will have among the fewest moving parts of any highway-capable production vehicle ever produced. We believe this design will deliver the performance, range and safety commercial fleets seek, while meaningfully reducing total cost of ownership compared to internal combustion engine vehicles due to lower operating and maintenance costs.

​

● | Significant opportunity exists in the commercial fleet market. We believe we are one of the only pure play light duty EV OEMs focused solely on commercial fleets. We believe there is significant demand in the commercial segment for EVs that will remain unmet for several years. Beginning with the Endurance, we believe designing vehicles with the functionality and particular needs of this market in mind, we will build strong customer relationships with fleet operators and companies that rent or lease vehicles to fleet operators to accelerate EV penetration. We believe that fleet operators will be drawn to the lower total cost of ownership of electric vehicles as opposed to the higher initial purchase price, which has been a factor limiting the pace of adoption of electric vehicles. We also believe that fleet usage, which in many cases may involve multiple shorter trips within range of a central base, rather than long-distance travel, can reduce the range anxiety that has also been a limiting factor in electric vehicle adoption. As a result, we expect strong demand for safe, reliable electric vehicles with a significantly reduced total cost of ownership and believe the Endurance and future programs will provide the opportunity for us to capture meaningful share in this market.

​

● | Proven team with deep experience in vehicle development and engineering and operations. Our senior executive team has extensive and diverse experience in the automotive and electric vehicle industries. During 2021, we added several highly accomplished executives to our team, including our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Commercial Officer, General Counsel and Senior Vice President of Operations, along with other key personnel throughout the organization. Our leaders are industry veterans, having executed strategic transformations and successfully designed, developed and launched numerous new vehicle programs at multiple OEMs and tier 1 suppliers. For example, our Chief Executive Officer has previously served as a chief executive officer at a leading investment firm, and chief executive officer, senior executive or board member at multiple automotive companies. Our President has over 30 years of experience serving in product development, engineering, manufacturing, commercial, and senior executive roles between Ford, BMW, and GM. He led GM’s $15 billion global crossovers business as the Executive Chief Engineer and Vehicle Line Executive. Our Senior Vice President, Operations has over 25 years of experience in the automotive industry, including serving as Vehicle Launch Leader at Ford. Our VP of Engineering has over 30 years’ experience in product development at multiple OEMs and suppliers,

​
Foxconn Transactions
​
As disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 10, 2021, we entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement with Foxconn Ohio. Pursuant to the APA, Foxconn Ohio would purchase the Lordstown facility for $230 million plus a reimbursement payment for certain operating and expansion costs incurred by us during from September 1, 2021 through the closing. We would continue to own our hub motor assembly line, battery module and packing line assets, certain intellectual property rights and other excluded assets. Foxconn Ohio paid us $100 million on November 18, 2021 and $50 million on January 28, 2022 as down payments of the purchase price. Foxconn Ohio is required to make an additional down payment of $50 million no later than April 15, 2022, subject to certain conditions. The balance of the purchase price, along with reimbursement of certain operating and expansion costs would be paid at closing. If the APA is terminated or if the transaction does not close prior to the later of (i) April 30, 2022 and (ii) 10 days after the transaction is cleared by CFIUS, we are obligated to repay the down payments to Foxconn. We have granted Foxconn a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the repayment obligation. 
​
The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement are subject to certain conditions, including, but not limited to: (a) the parties entering into a contract manufacturing agreement (the “Contract Manufacturing Agreement”), pursuant to which Foxconn would manufacture the Endurance at the Lordstown facility, and a lease (“Lordstown Facility Lease”), under which we would lease up to 30,000 square feet of space located at the Lordstown, Ohio facility from Foxconn for our Ohio-based employees, and (b) receipt of a communication that the CFIUS has concluded that the transaction is not a “covered transaction” or that CFIUS has completed its review of the transaction and determined there are no national security concerns with the transaction. We are also required to maintain minimum cash balances of $50 million through March 1, 2022 and $30 million thereafter. 
​
The Company and Foxconn have made significant progress negotiating the Contract Manufacturing Agreement and Lordstown Facility Lease, as well as supporting the review of the Foxconn Transactions by CFIUS. The parties have mutually agreed they no longer believe an operating agreement pursuant to which Lordstown would provide support to Foxconn, between signing and closing of the APA, for non-Endurance-specific investments was necessary.
​
The APA includes a commitment by Foxconn and the Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a joint venture agreement whereby, among other items, the parties would allocate engineering resources to jointly design, engineer, develop, validate, industrialize and launch vehicle programs for the commercial vehicle market in North America and internationally, including the granting of certain rights for the parties to commercialize such programs. The APA also includes a commitment by Foxconn and the Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a licensing agreement pursuant to which we would license to Foxconn our intellectual property relating to the Endurance frame, rolling chassis and other technologies, subject to reasonable royalties or licensing fees and other terms mutually agreed to by the parties.  In the place of a joint venture and licensing agreement, the parties agreed to explore a joint product development agreement. We are actively discussing the establishment of such an agreement with Foxconn, under which we would seek to use the MIH platform to develop a portfolio of electric vehicles targeting our commercial fleet customers, built at the Lordstown, Ohio plant and to license to Foxconn certain of our intellectual property. If an agreement is reached, we anticipate that Foxconn would also supply certain vehicle components and subsystems for newly developed vehicles, enabling us to leverage Foxconn’s manufacturing experience, supply-chain network and extensive experience in software development and integration (key capabilities in the production of EVs) to complement our EV design, development, engineering and homologation contributions.

We believe that any joint product development agreement with Foxconn would also need to incorporate an appropriate funding structure that enables us to raise the additional capital necessary to bring the Endurance into production as well as fund new vehicle development. We continue to explore all financing alternatives as we will need substantial funding to execute our operating plan that is anticipated to use significant capital for the foreseeable future.
​
No assurance can be made that the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, including the Contract Manufacturing Agreement and the Lordstown Facility Lease, or a joint product development agreement, any additional funding arrangements or other agreements will ultimately be consummated on the terms contemplated, or at all, or that they will provide the anticipated benefits. Even if the Foxconn Transactions are consummated in accordance with the current terms and on the anticipated timeline, we will need additional funding to continue our development efforts and maintain our current plans and timeline for commercial production. See Part I - Item 1. Business —Foxconn Transactions and Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks associated with the Foxconn Transactions and other related agreements being contemplated, including a joint product development agreement, and our need to raise additional capital.
​
Industry and Competition
​
Electric vehicle industry growth has accelerated in the past several years. According to EV Volumes.com, global sales of electric vehicles within the light vehicle segment grew 108% in 2021 and reached 6.75 million units, comprising 8.3% of all light vehicles sold annually. We believe this growth will continue into the future as increased offerings, technological developments, reduced costs, and additional charging infrastructure are expected to drive broader adoption. We expect countries around the world to become increasingly focused on meeting climate goals, in part, by reducing the environmental effects of internal combustion engine vehicles. This may include offering financial incentives to promote the use of electric vehicles and commitments from major automotive manufacturers to electrification as part of their long-term plans.

This may include offering financial incentives to promote the use of electric vehicles and commitments from major automotive manufacturers to electrification as part of their long-term plans.
​
Our primary target market is the commercial fleet segment, which is defined as commercial and governmental organizations with three or more vehicles. This market is represented by companies such as logistics companies, construction, building trade and other service providers, utilities, airlines and airport operators, telecommunication companies and insurance companies, as well as small- to mid-sized companies with fewer than 10 vehicles in their fleets. Commercial fleets purchase vehicles either directly from OEMs or indirectly through fleet management companies, dealers or other intermediaries. Government entities at the federal, state and local level represent a significant share of the fleet market that we believe will participate in the transition to electric vehicles and represent potential customers.
​
The commercial fleet market is a large potential market with strong demand for vehicles. We believe that there is significant opportunity to gain a share of this market by offering electric vehicles. We anticipate substantial commercial demand for electric trucks will be driven by the potential for lower total cost of ownership in comparison to traditional gasoline and diesel internal combustion engine vehicles. We also believe that a meaningful portion of industry demand will come from large well-capitalized fleet operators with commitments to reduce their carbon footprint. The specific use cases for electric trucks by fleet operators which, often involve multiple shorter trips, can alleviate the range anxiety that has been a limiting factor in 

9



electric vehicle adoption to date. By effectively marketing to commercial fleet operators, we believe we have the potential to secure significant and recurring purchases for our electric vehicles. 
​
Although competition within the broader electric vehicle and pickup market is intense, we believe that our focus on fleet customers will differentiate our vehicle offerings. While established OEMs and new entrants to the industry have announced plans to develop electric pickup trucks, we believe the total industry volume will remain well below expected demand during the foreseeable future. Furthermore, with relatively low production volume of EV pickup trucks anticipated to be sold during the next several years, we believe the fleet market will represent the smallest share of sales as the larger OEMs seek to sell to a segment of the EV pickup truck market that is conducive to higher price points. We are focusing on the specific needs of commercial fleets with the development and production of the Endurance and future vehicles. In addition, we believe a relationship with Foxconn and achieving a joint product development agreement for future vehicles off the MIH platform would provide the opportunity to accelerate the pace and reduce the cost of new vehicle development. We estimate approximately 500,000 pickup trucks are sold annually to fleet segments in the U.S. and Canada. EV pickup trucks can serve the needs of most of these fleet segments and are believed to generate significant savings in operating costs. In addition, EV pickup trucks are expected to help fleets reduce total cost of ownership, increase employee satisfaction, and achieve environmental sustainability goals. See Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks associated with the Foxconn Transactions and other related agreements being contemplated, including a joint product development agreement.
​
The Endurance
​
Our flagship vehicle is the Endurance. The design of the Endurance body will follow the same design principles that have made pickup trucks ideal for the fleet market, while its chassis will be designed for safety, capability, efficiency and flexibility. The Endurance’s bed box is designed to be fully compatible with existing third-party parts, upfitting options and accessories. Our use of in-wheel hub motors together with the Endurance’s proprietary software, is expected to lead to better traction, maneuverability and handling, making it an ideal vehicle for fleet operators. With this design, we believe that the Endurance will have among the fewest moving parts of any highway- capable production vehicle ever produced and will have a total cost of ownership that is lower than comparable pickup trucks that are currently commercially available.
Based on our current estimated specifications, we expect the Endurance will achieve a 0-60 miles per hour acceleration time of 5.5 seconds, a towing capacity of 8,000 pounds, a payload capacity of 1,200 pounds, a curb weight of 6,300 pounds, a total gross vehicle weight of 7,300 pounds, produce 550 horsepower and 4,800 pound feet of torque at the wheels. Based upon ongoing vehicle testing and engineering, management estimates the Endurance will deliver a targeted range of 200 miles per charge and fuel economy of 65 mile per gallon equivalent (“MPGe”), approximately 300% better than competing internal combustion engine pickups that average approximately 15 miles per gallon1. Actual vehicle performance and specifications, including range and MPGe, will vary significantly based on numerous factors, including driving conditions and final vehicle design attributes. See Part I - Item 1A. – Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks associated with the expected performance of the Endurance.
We are in the process of establishing pricing for the Endurance upon launch, which we expect to be approximately $63,500 including our standard option package but excluding the currently available U.S. federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. We believe our option package consists of popular equipment sought by commercial fleet customers.
​
1  Management estimates the Endurance will utilize 0.50 kilowatt-hour (“kWh”) per mile. This would be equivalent to approximately 65 MPGe based on the estimated energy equivalence of one gallon of gasoline at 33.7 kWh of electricity, per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (the “EPA”) MPGe methodology. 
​

​
Many fleet customers consider the total cost of ownership of a vehicle to be more important than the initial purchase price of a vehicle. We believe the capabilities of electric vehicles generally, and in particular the low number of parts that will be included in the Endurance, will lead to lower maintenance costs when compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. The need for routine maintenance is significantly reduced along with the elimination of the need to service or replace parts and materials for internal combustion engines, such as spark plugs, oil, oil filters, and transmission fluid. In addition, the Endurance’s brake pads and rotors are expected to last longer than those in internal combustion engine pickup trucks due to regenerative braking from the hub motors on all four wheels, representing another maintenance cost saving. As a result, over a five-year period, we anticipate that the average total cost of ownership of the Endurance is likely to be less than the average total cost of ownership of a comparable internal combustion engine pickup truck.
​
Electric In-Wheel Hub Motors
​
The Endurance will have four electric in-wheel hub motors. We have entered into supply and licensing agreements with Elaphe Propulsion Technologies Ltd. (“Elaphe”) to produce the initial batch of required hub motors. However, we have developed our own manufacturing line for the in-wheel hub motors and intend to manufacture the in-wheel hub motors at the Lordstown facility in the future. We anticipate that as part of our Contract Manufacturing Agreement with Foxconn, Foxconn would operate these hub motor production assets on our behalf. We believe the hub motors will provide efficiency, reliability and design flexibility and offer several advantages over traditional internal combustion engines. For example, in-wheel hub motors place the entire propulsion system within the wheels, providing a significant amount of design flexibility for the remainder of the vehicle. 
​
In-wheel hub motors contribute to the superior handling and maneuverability of the Endurance. They also eliminate the need for many parts found in both traditional and hybrid vehicles, including a drivetrain, gears, axles, differentials, universal joints, transmissions, oil, oil filters, spark plugs and engine valves, which will reduce the number of moving parts in the Endurance compared to other traditional, hybrid and electric vehicles available today and, therefore, expected maintenance costs.
​
Each hub motor and inverter pair are controlled by a central supervisory powertrain controller (“VCU”) that will manage traction, slip and efficiency on an axial basis, which we expect to provide favorable four-wheel drive traction when compared to other pickup trucks currently available to commercial fleets. Lordstown Motors has developed its own proprietary powertrain controller software and algorithms to achieve this performance using instantaneous torque control. The use of in-wheel hub motors and the absence of a traditional internal combustion engine create a large front crush zone, enhancing the safety of the vehicle and enabling the Endurance to have a “frunk” (a small trunk located at the front of the cab).
​
The motors will be equipped with regenerative braking that captures and stores power generated by deceleration of the vehicle. Many of the systems that will enable the use of in-wheel hub motors, such as the software that will interact and direct each of the four motors, as well as the independent front suspension, are proprietary to us.
​
Facilities
The Lordstown facility is a 640-acre manufacturing facility that we acquired on November 7, 2019 strategically located in Lordstown, Ohio, near I-80, the major interstate highway between Cleveland, Ohio, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Lordstown, Ohio, and the surrounding area is home to a highly trained workforce experienced with working in the Lordstown facility and manufacturing vehicles as well as an extensive automotive supply base. See “— Key Agreements, Other Alliances and Technology” and “— Environmental Regulations” for additional information about the acquisition and related agreements. 
The Lordstown facility consists of four main facilities in one location, in addition to multiple support buildings: (1) General Assembly, (2) a Body Shop, (3) Stamping and (4) a Paint Shop. The Lordstown facility has 

11



approximately 6.2 million square feet of manufacturing space and significant production capacity that we believe will be more than sufficient to support our targeted ramp up of production of the Endurance over the next several years. We also have solar-panels on-site, which generate approximately 2.2 megawatts of energy. The Lordstown facility is in near-production-ready condition with modern robotics, painting, assembly and stamping equipment and we continue to make tooling investments in order to commence full production of the Endurance. 
We are working towards completing construction on our production lines for in-wheel motors and initial lithium-ion battery packs. As part of our retooling efforts, we purchased and installed new machines, tooling, fixtures and quality and testing equipment, made additional investments in software, controls and other information technology systems, modified conveyor and robotics systems, converted the existing paint line process and installed new hub motor and battery packing assembly lines. After the Foxconn Transactions, we would continue to own certain assets in the facility, principally the hub motor and battery pack lines and tooling specific for the Endurance. However, we anticipate Foxconn would operate the equipment under the Contract Manufacturing Agreement.
We expect to complete the retooling that is necessary to enable limited production of the Endurance to commence as planned in the third quarter of 2022, subject to raising sufficient capital to launch the program, satisfactory completion of the Foxconn Transactions, vehicle testing and validation, and receipt of both the required regulatory approvals to sell the Endurance. Following the completion of the Foxconn Transactions, we would continue to be responsible for capital investments for certain tooling and other equipment specifically related to production of the Endurance. Foxconn would own and be responsible for maintaining and investing in general manufacturing and assembly assets, excluding the battery and hub motor lines that would be operated by Foxconn, but owned and maintained by us.
In November 2020, we opened our research, development and engineering center in Farmington Hills, Michigan. This facility includes space for engineering, product development, vehicle inspection and benchmarking, as well as labs for testing, validation and prototyping. This facility also houses our purchasing group as well as certain other corporate functions and will remain with the Company following the completion of the Foxconn Transactions.
In Irvine, California, we have established an engineering, vehicle development, and service center. This facility is focused primarily on developing advanced electronic hardware and software for our infotainment system as well as our cybersecurity, connected vehicle and fleet services systems. We have established Lordstown EV Sales, LLC, to receive direct orders from customers and have received our dealership license from the State of California.
​
Key Agreements, Other Alliances and Technology
​
GM
​
We have entered into several agreements with GM and its affiliates related to the acquisition and operation of the Lordstown facility and to provide financing arrangements. On November 7, 2019, we entered into an Asset Transfer Agreement, Operating Agreement and Mortgage Agreement (collectively, the “GM Property Agreements”) with GM providing for our acquisition and the continued operation of the Lordstown facility. See “- Environmental Regulations” for additional information.
​
On April 3, 2020, we entered into an agreement under which GM provides us with access to certain non-brand defining GM parts, including airbags, steering columns and steering wheels. This agreement was renewed for a term commencing on January 1, 2021 and ending December 31, 2023. On December 21, 2021, we entered into a further five year-term supply agreement which required a pre-payment of $17.8 million.
​

​
Elaphe Propulsion Technologies Ltd.
​
We have partnered with Elaphe to produce in-wheel hub motors. We entered into a license agreement with Elaphe, pursuant to which Elaphe granted us a perpetual license to manufacture, or have manufactured, the Elaphe Model L-1500 Endurance Motor, including enhanced or replacement versions of this motor, for use in the United States, Canada and Mexico in exchange for a license fee calculated on a per motor basis. We have substantially enhanced Elaphe’s Model L-1500 Endurance Motor and currently are using these enhanced motors in our vehicles. Elaphe is required to obtain our consent before it is permitted, within the United States, Canada or Mexico, to market, sell or otherwise distribute the Elaphe Model L-1500 Endurance Motor, or any replacement or substitute for it, including our enhanced version of the motor, or any hub motor, or replacement or substitute for it, for a substitute model pickup truck replacing the Endurance (the “Licensed Products”). In addition, Elaphe must immediately notify us if it sells, licenses or distributes the Licensed Products through a third party within the United States, Canada or Mexico and must offer to sell or license to us on the same terms available to such third party.
​
Equity Purchase Agreement
​
On July 23, 2021, we entered into an equity purchase agreement (the “Equity Purchase Agreement”) with YA II PN, LTD. (“YA”), pursuant to which YA has committed to purchase up to $400 million in shares of our Class A common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Equity Purchase Agreement. The actual amount that we can raise under this facility will depend on market conditions as well as limitations in the agreement. In particular, at current market prices of our shares of Class A common stock, without stockholder approval, we cannot issue or sell to YA shares of our Class A common stock in excess of 35.1 million shares (the “Exchange Cap”), which would limit the amount of funds we are able to raise to significantly less than the $400 million commitment under the Equity Purchase Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued 9.6 million shares to YA for $49.4 million, net of equity issuance costs.
​
Other Partners
 ​
As production of the Endurance ramps up, we may partner with key service providers to enable us to serve fleet operators and other customers efficiently and effectively for aftermarket parts and service and charging infrastructure. 
We believe that most fleet operators use service agreements with third-party service providers to maintain and repair their fleets and to provide aftermarket parts, and that an arrangement with a national service provider might be attractive to fleet customers considering purchasing the Endurance. 
To support our fleet customers, we have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Cox Automotive to provide service and support to all Lordstown Motors EV fleet customers. Cox Automotive has a network of more than 6,000 service centers, 3,000 partner locations and 800 mobile technicians nationwide. Subject to negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement, the Cox team would deliver a full suite of service solutions including preventative scheduled maintenance, vehicle pickup and delivery, battery servicing, vehicle and collision repairs and roadside assistance. Coupled with our advanced connected vehicle technology and over-the-air update capabilities, this relationship is expected to position us to meet our customer needs after they take delivery of our vehicles.
Research and Development
​
We have made and, subject to raising sufficient capital, expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to complete the design, engineering, testing and certification of the Endurance to commence commercial production and sales. These costs will primarily relate to testing, validation, design modifications, integration of third-party components, designs for tooling, development of our own components, proprietary software and systems. Our research and development also includes efforts to 

13



seek to leverage our technologies to develop additional all-electric vehicles targeted for the commercial EV market. We expect that these activities will be completed by our employees and intend to hire additional research and development personnel. However, we have utilized third party design and engineering firms for certain development activities to date and will continue to do so as we continue to ramp up operations.
​
Sourcing
​
The Endurance’s bill of materials is expected to consist of approximately 2,300 components with its 10 most expensive systems representing almost 75% of the anticipated cost of the Endurance. As discussed above, we have an agreement with Elaphe to license in-wheel hub motors, and we have entered into agreements with a battery manufacturer to purchase lithium-ion cylindrical battery cells. Motors and battery cells represent two of the Endurance’s most critical components. We also expect that the flexible and compatible design of the Endurance and our agreements with GM that provide access to certain non-brand defining GM parts will offer certain transitional benefits as we build out and finalize our supply chain. Other key raw materials that will be included in the Endurance and its components are steel, aluminum, copper, neodymium, nickel and cobalt.
Subject to receiving sufficient funding, we believe we will be able to obtain adequate sources of supply for the equipment, components and raw materials necessary to manufacture and sell the Endurance in accordance with our plans. Disruptions to the supply chain, including those due to the COVID-19 pandemic, have resulted in challenges obtaining certain components and raw materials in a timely manner and/or at favorable pricing. As a result, we have adjusted and may continue to adjust our design, materials, components, production processes and production timeline to adapt to these limitations. Further changes in our timeline, capital resources, business conditions, the impact of COVID-19 or other pandemics, governmental changes and other factors beyond our control or that we do not presently anticipate, could affect our ability to receive the material we need for production. As we and the broader electric vehicle industry grow in the future, there is no guarantee that battery cell manufacturers will be able and willing to continue to increase their capacity to meet demand. In addition, the automotive and other industries are currently experiencing a global supply shortage of semiconductors, which could impact our testing and production costs, and volume and timeline of production. Prices and supply of key raw materials have risen, in many cases significantly, and there continue to be supply shortages of certain materials and components. As a result of the foregoing and limited initial production volume, our current cost of our bill of materials is substantially higher than the anticipated selling price of the Endurance at launch. There can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce the cost of our bill of materials below our anticipated selling price for the Endurance. Increased demand for certain materials, whether due to electric vehicle growth or other factors, or reduced supply for certain materials, whether due to trade restrictions or other factors, may further increase our costs or delay the timing to obtain the materials or components and impact our production timeline, profitability and cash flows. See Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding sourcing.
​
Intellectual Property
​
Intellectual property is important to our business. We intend to establish and protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we develop through a combination of trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how. We have filed numerous trademark and patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, but as of this date no trademarks or patents have been issued. 
​
We expect to develop additional intellectual property and proprietary technology as the Endurance’s engineering and validation activities proceed and we expand into developing other vehicles. Technologies that we have and intend to invest in and develop include engineering software, powertrain systems and controls, infotainment, cybersecurity, telematics and electrical architecture hardware and software. As we develop our technology, we will continue to assess whether additional trademark or patent applications or other intellectual property registrations are appropriate. We also seek to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, including trade secrets and know-how, through limited access, confidentiality and other contractual agreements. In addition to the intellectual property that we own, we license and utilize key 

14



technologies under our agreements with Elaphe. See Part I – Item 1. Business — Key Agreements, Other Alliances and Technology for more information.
We cannot be certain that we will be able to adequately develop and protect our intellectual property rights, or that other companies will not claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. We may also use open-source code and other non-proprietary technology that would not be protected from use by our competitors. See Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding intellectual property. 
​
Sales and Marketing 
​
We plan to focus our sales and marketing efforts on direct sales through our subsidiary, Lordstown EV Sales, LLC, to commercial fleet operators and fleet management companies rather than through third-party dealerships. However, we intend to explore other distribution strategies as our business grows.
​
An important aspect of our sales and marketing strategy involves pursuing relationships with specialty upfitting and fleet management companies to incorporate the Endurance into their fleets or sales programs. As their main area of business, fleet management companies act as an intermediary facilitating the acquisition of new vehicles for the ultimate end user fleets. They provide a valuable distribution channel for us because of their extensive end user relationships and ability to offer attractive financing rates. As a result of this strategy, we expect that we will not be required to make significant investments in a large direct sales force or third-party dealership network, thereby avoiding an increase in fixed costs.
​
During 2021, we announced a series of agreements with an affiliate of Holman Enterprises, including a co-marketing agreement that establishes a framework for us and ARI, Holman’s fleet management services organization, to co-market and co-develop business opportunities with our respective customers and an agreement that establishes a framework pursuant to which ARI would use reasonable efforts to facilitate orders from its leasing clients for the Endurance over a three-year time period on the terms set forth in the agreement.
​
We have continued to pursue our strategy of pursuing relationships with specialty upfitting and fleet management companies to incorporate the Endurance into their fleet management programs. We have entered into vehicle purchase agreements with additional fleet management companies as a component of that strategy. These vehicle purchase agreements establish the terms and conditions of potential future vehicle purchases and other cooperation and generally have the following terms:

● | Term of three to five years;
--+-----------------------------


● | Reference to the Company as a preferred supplier;
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | Order procedures, including certain forecasting, confirming, status, changing and cancelling procedures;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Down payment terms, which are generally 5% down 90 days prior to the requested delivery date;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Invoicing, delivery and payment terms; and
--+-------------------------------------------


● | Other customary terms, including warranties, indemnification, intellectual property use and confidentiality terms.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
These vehicle purchase agreements may be terminated by either party at will on 30 days’ notice. They do not commit the counterparties to purchase vehicles, but we believe that they provide us with a significant indicator of demand for the Endurance. Additional agreements signed are with Pride Equipment (Pride EV), Mike Alpert Fleet Solutions, Sherpa Commercial Vehicles, and a small number of purchase agreements from municipalities, demonstrating their interest in procuring the Endurance for their fleets.
​

​
Human Capital Resources
​
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately, 632 full-time personnel in the Lordstown, Ohio, facility, our research, development and engineering center in Farmington Hills, Michigan and our engineering, vehicle development and service center in Irvine, California. These employees’ skills are in the areas of manufacturing, engineering, marketing, sales, purchasing, facilities, human resources, IT, supply chain, quality, program management, software design, strategy, accounting and finance. These employees are designing and engineering the Endurance and preparing the plant for commercial production. However, if we complete the Foxconn Transactions, we anticipate substantially all of our manufacturing employees, along with certain other employees, transferring to, and becoming employees of Foxconn.
​
Government Support and Regulation
​
In addition to the discussion in this section, also see Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Risks Relating to Regulation and Claims.”
​
Our management expects to continue to engage in discussions with local, state and federal officials to explore the availability of appropriate grant, loan and tax incentives. There are numerous enacted federal programs that we believe will directly or indirectly support the growth of electric vehicles, including among commercial fleet customers. These include the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 that provided $7.5 billion for a national EV charging network through grants to state and local governments, transit authorities and tribes. The bill also included measures to promote greater electrification of the transportation sector, funding to expand battery processing and manufacturing and a surface transportation block grant program.
​
We have been awarded a grant of up to $2.1 million from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. The funding is anticipated to be received in multiple installments. We are finalizing the documentation and therefore no assurances can be made as to the timing, terms and conditions or ultimate amount of the funding.
​
We have accepted an invitation from the U.S. Department of Energy and have started the due diligence process toward securing an Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (“ATVM”) loan. Established in 2007, ATVM supports the development of fuel-efficient, advanced technology vehicles in the United States. The program provides loans to automotive or component manufacturers for establishing manufacturing facilities in the United States that produce fuel-efficient vehicles. There can be no assurance this loan will be available to us and, if made available, what the terms, collateral requirements and timing for any funding would be. We have been informed that an ATVM loan would likely be secured by a first priority lien on our assets. In the near term, we do not believe that we would be able to satisfy the conditions to obtain an ATVM loan, including the requirement to demonstrate our viability as a company. 
​
We operate in an industry that is subject to extensive vehicle safety and testing and environmental regulations, some of which evolve over time as new technologies are introduced to the market. Government regulations regarding the manufacture, sale and implementation of products and systems similar to our electric vehicles are subject to future change. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes will have upon our business. Violations of these regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines, penalties and/or orders to cease the operations in violation or to conduct or pay for corrective work. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits and licenses. In addition to the domestic regulations and standards discussed below, we expect to comply with Canadian standards and believe these standards are substantially similar to the domestic standards. Based on our initial business plan, we do not expect to be subject to regulatory requirements outside of the U.S. and Canada.
​

16



​
Vehicle Safety and Testing Regulation
​
Our vehicles will be subject to, and must comply with, many regulations established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including applicable U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standards (“FMVSS”). As an OEM, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and, when applicable, the NHTSA bumper standards before a vehicle can be manufactured for sale, offered for sale, introduced into interstate commerce, imported into or sold in the United States. There are many FMVSS that will apply to our vehicles, including crashworthiness and crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements (e.g., those relating to limitations on electrolyte spillage, battery retention and the avoidance of electric shock after a crash). We expect that our vehicles will meet all applicable FMVSS. Additionally, there are regulatory changes being considered for several FMVSS, and though we expect to comply with such changes, there is no assurance of compliance until the final regulatory changes have been enacted and we are able to evaluate the vehicles’ compliance with those new FMVSS requirements.
In addition to FMVSS, we must comply with other NHTSA requirements and other federal laws and regulations administered by NHTSA, including, for example, early warning reporting requirements, Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) reporting, an obligation to conduct recalls of vehicles in the field upon a determination of a safety defect or noncompliance and owner’s manual requirements. We also must comply with the Automobile Information and Disclosure Act, which requires OEMs to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and other pricing. Further, this law allows inclusion of fuel economy metrics (e.g. range and cost savings), as determined by the U.S. EPA, and crash test ratings, as determined by NHTSA.
​
Battery Safety and Testing Regulations 
​
Our battery packs must conform to mandatory regulations governing the transport of “dangerous goods” that may present a risk in transportation, which items include lithium-ion batteries and are subject to regulations issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). These regulations are based on the UN Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods - Model Regulations and related UN Manual Tests and Criteria. The regulations vary by the mode of transportation by which these items are shipped (e.g., by ocean vessel, rail, truck or air). There are additional industry standards related to the development and testing of EV batteries, including for example, standards published by the Society of Automotive Engineers (“SAE”), International Organization for Standards (“ISO”) and Underwriters Laboratories (“UL”). The use, handling, storage, disposal and exposure of our battery packs are also subject to many different regulations at the federal, state and local levels.
​
Environmental Credits 
​
In connection with the delivery and placement into service of our zero-emission vehicles (“ZEV”), under the U.S. EPA’s and California’s Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) rules and standards and the U.S. DOT’s Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFÉ”) standards for mobile sources, and under California’s ZEV standard, we will earn tradable credits that can be sold to other OEMs. Like the United States, California also has its own GHG emissions standard that seeks to reduce GHGs over time. Other U.S. states, including Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont, have adopted some or all of California’s standards. We intend to take advantage of these regulatory frameworks by registering and selling GHG, CAFÉ and ZEV credits. In addition, we have entered into an emissions credit agreement with GM pursuant to which, and subject to the terms of which, during the first three annual production/model years wherein we produce vehicles at least ten months out of the production/model year, the counterparty will have the option to purchase such emissions credits as well as emissions credits from any other U.S. state, country or jurisdiction generated by vehicles produced by us and not otherwise required by us to comply with emissions laws and regulations at a purchase price equal to 75% of the fair market value of such credits. While our plan is for the first three annual production/model years for the purpose of this 

17



agreement to be 2023, 2024 and 2025, it is possible that this agreement could extend beyond these model years if we do not achieve ten or more months of production during those annual production/model years.
​
Environmental Regulations
​
We are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, involving, among other matters, water use, discharge air emissions, use of chemicals and recycled materials, energy sources, storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, the protection of the environment, natural resources and endangered species and the remediation of environmental contamination. We are required to obtain and comply with the terms and conditions of environmental permits, many of which may be difficult and expensive to obtain and must be renewed on a periodic basis. A failure to comply with these laws, regulations or permits could result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties and the suspension or loss of such permits, and possibly orders to cease the non-compliant operations.
The U.S. Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity from the U.S. EPA for our vehicles prior to their entry into commerce in all 50 states. In addition, we must obtain an Executive Order from the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) in order to sell vehicles in California and those states that have adopted its standards. The Certificate of Conformity and Executive Order are required for each model year. A failure to apply for and obtain a Certificate of Conformity or Executive Order will result in delays in the sale of the Endurance and adversely affect our business.
As part of our acquisition of the Lordstown facility from GM, we were required to accept the plant and all property in “as is — where is” condition, including environmental responsibilities. Prior to entering into the Asset Transfer Agreement with GM (the “Asset Transfer Agreement”), GM completed an investigation and remediation program pursuant to an Administrative Order on Consent (“AOC”) under the U.S. EPA’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) Corrective Action Program. Upon the U.S. EPA’s approval of GM’s investigation and remediation program, GM placed an environmental covenant on the real property, which requires, among other things, (i) the maintenance of nominal financial assurance, (ii) the limitation of the real property to commercial/industrial use, (iii) the prohibition of groundwater for potable use, (iv) the implementation of a dust control plan and (v) the maintenance of impermeable surfaces on certain areas of the real property. We assumed these responsibilities under the environmental covenant as a condition to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Transfer Agreement. We retained the same environmental consultant used by GM to develop and implement the investigation and remediation effort that ultimately led to the U.S. EPA’s approval. This consultant has intimate familiarity with the Lordstown facility and has allowed us to develop quickly a thorough understanding of the comprehensive nature of the environmental response actions taken by GM and to implement steps to ensure ongoing compliance with the environmental covenant on the real property. To further manage potential environmental risk, we have obtained an environmental liability policy providing certain coverages up to the amount of $25.0 million as required under the Asset Transfer Agreement. In addition, to mitigate the risk associated with the Ohio EPA’s authority to require future remediation activities at the Lordstown facility related to historic environmental conditions, in April 2020 we entered into an Administrative Order wherein the Ohio EPA agreed to not pursue enforcement actions against us for historical environmental conditions provided that we comply with the terms of the environmental covenant. Upon closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Foxconn will generally assume environmental liabilities arising from the Lordstown facility; however, we will retain an indemnity obligation for certain undisclosed liabilities known by us or caused by us during our period of ownership. 
​
Corporate History and Information
​
Lordstown Motors Corp., originally known as DiamondPeak Holdings Corp. (“DiamondPeak”), was incorporated in Delaware on November 13, 2018 as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a business combination and completed its initial public offering in March 2019 (the “Initial Public Offering”). On October 23, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), DiamondPeak consummated the merger pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 1, 2020 (the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among DiamondPeak, DPL Merger Sub Corp. (“Merger Sub”) and Lordstown Motors Corp. (“Legacy Lordstown” and 

18



now known as Lordstown EV Corporation), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy Lordstown, with Legacy Lordstown surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of DiamondPeak (the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the “Business Combination”). On the Closing Date, and in connection with the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), DiamondPeak changed its name to Lordstown Motors Corp. 
​
The Business Combination has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Under this method of accounting, DiamondPeak was treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. Operations prior to the Business Combination are those of Legacy Lordstown and the historical financial statements of Legacy Lordstown became the historical financial statements of the combined company, upon the consummation of the Business Combination.
​
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”):
​

● | Each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Legacy Lordstown (“Legacy Lordstown common stock”) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time converted into 55.8817 shares of our Class A common stock (the “Exchange Ratio”).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Each outstanding share of Class B common stock, $0.0001 par value, of DiamondPeak converted into one share of Class A common stock, resulting in an issuance of 7 million shares of Class A common stock in the aggregate.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Each convertible promissory note issued by Legacy Lordstown evidencing indebtedness of an aggregate of $40.0 million plus accrued interest automatically converted, in accordance with the terms thereof, into shares of Class A common stock at a price of $10.00 per share, resulting in an issuance of approximately 4 million shares of Class A common stock in the aggregate.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Each stock option to purchase Legacy Lordstown common stock (each, a “Legacy Lordstown Option”) that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time automatically converted into an option, which continued to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting and exercisability terms) as were applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In connection with the entry into the Business Combination Agreement, we sold an aggregate of 50 million shares of Class A common stock to certain investors for aggregate consideration of $500 million to provide us with additional capital. Concurrently with the Closing, we also issued to Brown Gibbons Lang & Company (“BGL”) redeemable warrants entitling BGL to purchase, in the aggregate, 1.6 million shares of Class A common stock (the “BGL Warrants”).
​
On January 27, 2021, we redeemed all of the public warrants (the “Public Warrants”) originally issued in the Initial Public Offering that remained outstanding. The BGL Warrants and the private placement warrants issued to certain investors (the “Private Placement Warrants”) were not subject to redemption and as of December 31, 2021, 2.3 million Private Placement Warrants and 1.6 million BGL Warrants were outstanding. Prior to the redemption, the term “Warrants” collectively refers to the Public Warrants, the Private Placement Warrants and the BGL Warrants and, after the redemption, collectively refers to the Private Placement Warrants and the BGL Warrants. 
​
The mailing address of our principal executive office is 2300 Hallock Young Road, Lordstown, Ohio 44481. Our telephone number is (234) 285-4001. Our website address is www.lordstownmotors.com. Our Class A common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Stock Market under the symbol “RIDE.” Information contained on our website or connected thereto does not constitute part of, and is not incorporated by reference into, this report.
