Business Overview
 
Leader Capital Holdings Corp. is an early stage technology company that conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Leader Financial Group Limited, a Seychelles corporation incorporated on March 6, 2017 (“LFGL”), and JFB Internet Service Limited, a Hong Kong corporation incorporated on July 6, 2017 (“JFB”).
 
Through LFGL, we act as the service provider for a mobile application investment platform that is owned by JFB. The platform connects investors with financial service providers in an effort to sharpen operational efficiency and seeks to address customer demands for more innovative services. It is a ready-made application created to meet the needs of financial service providers, especially trust companies and insurance companies. The platform is customizable and each financial institution can adjust the platform to better suit their client’s needs.
 
The Company had an agreement with a third party whereby we authorized the third party to use our investment platform and related applications until December 31, 2020 for a fee. Both parties decided to terminate the agreement at maturity.
 
The Company has developed a new, more comprehensive mobile application, the FinMaster App (the “App”). The FinMaster App intends to offer one-stop solution for multi-facet financial services. Key services include real-time Taiwan stock market quotes, financial industry information and news, social media activities, on-line live broadcast, A.I. stock selection and other features. With more than 350,000 downloads of the FinMaster App, the Company continues to collect data as well as user feedback to enhance current App features and fine tune research and development (“R&D”) plans to optimize customer experience.

Acquisition of Nice Products Inc.
 
On August 17, 2020, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary JFB Internet Service Limited, a company incorporated and existing under the laws of Hong Kong (the “Buyer”), acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock (the “Acquisition”) of Nice Products Inc., a company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands and the Company’s software ODM developer of the FinMaster App (“NPI”), pursuant to the terms and conditions of that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of August 17, 2020 (the “Purchase Agreement”), among the Company, the Buyer, NPI, the selling shareholders of NPI identified therein (each a “Seller,” and, collectively, the “Sellers”) and the representative of the Sellers identified therein (the “Sellers’ Representative”). The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition was $4,850,000, less certain discounts, expenses and reductions for outstanding NPI debt owed to the Company and/or its affiliates. The net purchase price for the acquisition was $3,506,042, payable in 8,415,111 shares of the Company’s common stock to the Sellers in accordance with their respective pro rata percentage.
 
Upon the consummation of the acquisition, among other things, the Sellers: (a) resigned from their positions as directors and/or officers of NPI, (b) released NPI from any claims and (c) entered into employment agreements with the Buyer. Jun-Yuan Chen, a Seller and the Sellers’ Representative under the Purchase Agreement, was already an employee of the Buyer prior to the acquisition, and therefore, did not enter into an employment agreement with the Buyer at the closing of the acquisition.
 
In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, for a period of 5 years from the Closing Date, the Sellers agreed to not compete with NPI’s business in the following territories: (a) Greater China (including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) and (b) any other country or other territory in which NPI or the Buyer has provided services, offered or promoted services or otherwise conducted business at any time in the past 2 years. During the same 5 year period, the Sellers are also subject to customary non-solicitation and non-disparagement obligations.
 
In addition, the Sellers agreed to indemnify the Company, the Buyer, and each of their affiliates (including, after the closing, NPI), subject to certain limitations, for any Losses (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) arising out of breaches by the Sellers of their respective covenants and certain other matters specified in the Purchase Agreement. Subject to certain exclusions, such right to indemnification will be available only after the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses exceeds $1,000.

As a result of the acquisition, the Company now owns, indirectly through the Buyer, 100% of NPI. NPI, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, LOC Weibo Co., Ltd. (“LOC”) and Beijing DataComm Cloud Media Technology Co., Ltd. (“BJDC”), companies organized under the laws of the Republic of China (“ROC” or “Taiwan”) and the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or “China”), respectively, engages primarily in the development of ecological-system applications, integration of big data and promotion of OTT applications. As a result of the acquisition, our FinMaster App was launched to the market in a timely and efficient manner and clients on this open platform are served more effectively and satisfactorily. Based on the successful development of our FinMaster App, LOC and BJDC jointly accumulated in-depth knowledge of FinTech App development, including the marketing expertise built up and the perfect allocation of the Company’s resources. We believe LCHD, through LOC and BJDC will further conclude more customized App contracts to help the clients to incubate the avant-garde Apps to expand their businesses efficiently and effectively.
 
Competition
 
Our market is competitive, and we expect competition in our market to increase as existing competitors enhance and expand their product and service offerings and as new participants enter the market. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profitability and loss of market share. We cannot ensure that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. Some of our customers and companies with which we have strategic relationships may also become competitors.
 
Many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources than we have. As a result, these companies may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services, or other incentives that we cannot match or offer. These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond more quickly to new technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns. We believe they may also pursue and adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners. In addition, competitors with greater financial resources may make strategic acquisitions to increase their ability to gain market share or improve the quality or marketability of their products. Furthermore, we face challenges in selling our product to large companies in the process industries that have internally developed their own proprietary software solutions.
 
Today in Taiwan’s stock information App market, the competition is very keen. It is estimated that Mitake App by Mitake Information Corporation and Yahoo Kimo Stock Market by Yahoo Finance, both have more than one million downloads; other Apps like ANUE App by ANUE.COM and Inc, Mr. Investment by Yuanta Financial Holding, both have more than half a million downloads. The Company keeps fine-tuning the marketing strategy and reaping the synergy by partnership with more diversified marketing channels to bring in more downloads. 
 
However, most of our competitors only provide direct services to a single company, and users can only choose that company’s App.  The FinMaster App has integrated various functions such as real time stock streaming, financial news, discussion forum, and voice and video call in one application, which is different from most of its competitors.  We believe that these integrated functions provide us with an advantage over our competition. 
 
Marketing
 
The FinMaster App is marketed mainly through word of mouth. Currently, we also employ Facebook, and YouTube as our marketing tools. During the past fiscal years 2022 and 2021, we also broadcasted commercials on various television stations in Taiwan to promote the FinMaster App. We also rely on our clients and business contacts, such as insurance brokerage houses, real estate agent firms, social network groups, and securities firms to encourage their clients to download the FinMaster App.

Intellectual Property
 
The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We rely on intellectual property laws, including trade secrets, copyright, patent and trademark laws in the U.S. and abroad. We have not patented our proprietary technology in order to keep our technology architecture, trade secrets, and engineering roadmap private. We may in the future file patent applications; however, such applications may not result in the issuance of any patents, and any issued patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us. Our ability to continually develop new intellectual property and deliver new functionality quickly serves to protect us against our competitors.
Employees
 
As of December 8, 2022, the Company had 34 employees.
 
Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 22, 2017. Our principal executive office is located at Room 2708-09, Metropolis Tower, 10 Metropolis Drive, Hung Hom, Hong Kong.
Government Regulation and Approvals
 
The Company offers its clients a mobile application that allows their customers to review their asset portfolio(s) and communicate their investment decisions with our clients in real-time. Neither of our Apps are a trading platform, broker dealer or exchange, and therefore we do not expect to be subject to regulatory oversight by the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or other financial regulatory agencies. We are not aware of any governmental regulations or approvals required for the marketing or use of the Apps or the services provided.
Emerging Growth Company
 
The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the requirements of Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of stockholders on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
 
The Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates
 
We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (1) August 31, 2024, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (3) the last day of our fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (which would occur if the market value of our equity securities that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter), or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three-year period.
 
To the extent that we continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company,” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years.
