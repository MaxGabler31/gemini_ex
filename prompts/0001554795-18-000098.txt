On June 20, 2012, InnerScope acquired InnerScope Advertising Agency, LLC. Through this Acquisition and Plan of Share Exchange with InnerScope Advertising Agency, LLC (“ILLC”), a commonly owned entity, InnerScope acquired a 100% interest of all membership interests in ILLC. On November 1, 2013, InnerScope entered into an Acquisition and Plan of Share Exchange with Intela-Hear, LLC (“Intela-Hear”), a commonly owned entity, whereby InnerScope acquired 100% of the outstanding membership interests of Intela-Hear. InnerScope (herein after referring to InnerScope, ILLC and Intela-Hear or “the Company”) was formed to fill the gap in the advertising/marketing side of the hearing device industry. Both ILLC and Intela-Hear were controlled and majority owned by our Chairman.
 
On October 28, 2016, a majority of the Company’s shareholders, based on the recommendation of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “BOD”), approved a forward split of the common stock, whereby an additional two shares of common stock were issued for every share of common stock outstanding (the “Forward Split”). The Company filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada on October 31, 2016. All share amounts for all periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Forward Split.
 
InnerScope is an "emerging growth company" within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.
 
InnerScope will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least $1 billion (as indexed for inflation), (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering under this prospectus, (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt and (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which we refer to as the “Exchange Act”).
 
InnerScope also qualifies as a “smaller reporting company” under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $75 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.
 Our authorized capital stock currently consists of 225,000,000 shares of common stock, and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our common stock is listed on The OTCQB under the symbol “INND.”
 Our principal corporate headquarters are located at 2151 Professional Drive, Second Floor, Roseville, CA. 95661. Our telephone number is (916) 218-4100. Our website address is www.innd.com.

Customers
 
Moore Family Hearing Company (“MFHC”), a related party, controlled by our Chairman, pursuant to a Marketing Agreement (the “MFHC Marketing Agreement”), accounted for approximately 48% and 83% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Prior to the sale, MFHC stores increased from 18 as of January 1, 2015 to 20 as August 5, 2016. We charged MHFC $3,200 per store per month effective January 1, 2015.

On August 5, 2016, the Company along with Mark Moore (“Mark”, the Company’s chairman), Matthew Moore (“Matthew”, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer) and Kim Moore (“Kim”, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer) entered into a Store Expansion Consulting Agreement (the “Expansion Agreement”). Mark, Matthew and Kim are herein referred to collectively as the Moores. Pursuant to the Expansion Agreement, the Company and the Moores were responsible for all physical plant and marketing details for new store openings during the initial term of six-months. The Expansion Agreement was cancelled on January 6, 2017. The Company’s client has decided to do their own marketing in-house and eliminate this out-sourced contract, and has decided to delay the opening of any new stores.  The Company has recognized a gain on the cancellation of the Expansion Agreement of $160,000 and $64,000 in other income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Also on August 5, 2016, the Company and the Moores entered into a Consulting Agreement (the “Consulting Agreement”) with the same party as the store Expansion Agreement. Under the Consulting Agreement, including the Non-Compete provision covering a ten- mile radius of any retail store, the Company and the Moores will provide unlimited licensing of the Intela-Hear brand name, exclusive access to the Aware Aural Rehab Program within 10 miles of retail stores, exclusive territory of all services within 10 miles of retail stores and 40 hours per month of various consulting services. The Consulting Agreement continues until January 31, 2019, unless terminated for cause, as defined in the Consulting Agreement. On May 2, 2017, the Company received a demand letter threatening litigation unless all monies paid pursuant to the Consulting Agreement are returned. On May 26, 2017, a complaint (the “Complaint”) was filed against the Company and the Moores, which includes a request for rescission of the Consulting Agreement.  The Company believes the Complaint by the third party is frivolous and without merit, as well as not providing sufficient cause for the Agreement to be terminated. The Company has filed a countersuit against this third party for breach of contract so that it may recover the amounts owed under the Consulting Agreement, however, effective January 1, 2017, the Company has not recognized revenue from the Consulting Agreement, and accordingly, $847,223 is classified as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets presented herein.
 The Company recognized $402,777 of revenue from the Consulting Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
Effective August 5, 2016, the Company entered into a Marketing Agreement (the “Marketing Agreement”) with the same customer as noted above. Pursuant to the Marketing Agreement, the Company was to provide marketing concepts and designs to promote its’ products and use the Company’s advertising services for an initial six- month period. Pursuant to the Marketing Agreement, the Company was to receive $50,000 per month. On January 6, 2017, the Marketing Agreement was cancelled. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized $193,548 of revenue from the Marketing Agreement.
 
We typically focus on the medium size hearing aid providers and practices (4 to 20 locations) to large hearing aid 20+ dispensing practice locations where the advantages of strategic, cost-effective advertising are appreciated but practice ownership cannot afford or have the time or expertise in-house to create and maintain these programs. The Company is currently marketing its’ services to potential new clients.
 
Revenue Generation
 
The Company has begun to implement an industry encompassing revenue strategy, including the current revenue model to other major sectors of the global hearing industry. The Company plans include generating revenues from 7 separate revenue streams. Each stream will generate revenue and be poised for growth, increasing the Company’s market penetration.
 
The 7 revenue streams are:
 
Patient Management System (PMS): a SaaS based software program which was created, designed and customized by and for audiologists, specifically to fill a much-needed clinical gap solved in other multidiscipline software programs. It allows audiological retail clinics to better manage their day-to-day operations through efficient clinical workflow, patient follow up, and logical organization of data. The PMS software platform delivers a comprehensive business solution. Once the data is uploaded, the platform seamlessly integrates the needs of the audiologist, management, patient and marketing. The software also provides a link between an electronic medical record (EMR) system containing patient's medical history, all while seamlessly integrating the schedule and patient files of the clinics’ patient management platform. EMR systems are not designed for Audiology and the records are often not integrated. The Company’s PMS software solves that problem by linking the two platforms.
 
Buying Group: The Company will create an exclusive Buying Group experience that will permit hearing aid practices of all sizes to reduce their wholesale costs by aggregating their orders with other practices to obtain a lower per unit cost.

-

 
Direct-to-Consumer (DTC): The Company has begun the marketing and selling of products within the new emerging “Hearables” and “Wearables” markets in “Personal Sound Amplification Products” (PSAP’s) and the Over-the-Counter (OTC) hearing aid market created by the result of recently passed Congressional legislation, known as “The Hearing Aid Act of 2017”, which allows the purchase of hearing aids and related products without seeking a medical professional. The Company will continue to market and sell these products, as well as invest in “Hearable” technology and has and will continue to create its own brands and technology in the PSAP and OTC hearing aids in the DTC markets. 
 
APP Development: The Company plans on building apps for the iOS and Android markets that will be dedicated to serving the hearing impairment population around the world. The APPs will be developed to help the audiology and hearing aid retail practices that have joined the Buying Group or using the Company’s PMS software, as well as APPs for the hearing-impaired consumer to use for a better hearing experience.
 
Advertising and Marketing: This division will be built on the Company’s current business and will include graphic artists, digital and print marketing experts, and telemarketers. This division will assist all divisions in helping to market and deploy all products and services to practices and consumers, as well as assisting Buying Group members with advertising and marketing for their own practices. Whether the hearing aid dispensary is small, medium or large, we have previously shown an ability to increase the total revenue of our clients without increasing cost. There are over 14,000 retail hearing aid dispensing practices in the United States. The company operates in a highly competitive and growing industry. The proliferation of media channels, including the rapid development of interactive technologies and mediums, along with their integration within all offerings has fragmented consumer audiences, especially the 55+ age sector which is our clients’ primary targeted audience. These developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a cost-effective way, causing them to turn to marketing service providers for a customized mix of advertising and marketing communications services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditures. We provide a comprehensive range of services (including consulting services), grouped into four fundamental disciplines: advertising/marketing, customer relationship management, public relations and specialty communications.
 
Retail: The Company plans to open a chain of Audiological and Hearing Aid Clinics throughout the United States and eventually abroad.
 
Research and Development (“R&D”): Management has been researching and developing products and solutions for the Business to Business (“BTB”) and Business to Consumer (“BTC”) hearing impaired markets for more than 3 decades. The R&D team which will be comprised of world renowned scientists, business professionals and industry leaders, will develop and deploy products.
 
Consulting Agreements
 
On April 3, 2017, the Company entered into a one (1) year Financial Consulting Agreement (the “FC Agreement”), with a Consultant (the “FC Consultant”). Pursuant to the FC Agreement, the FC Consultant will assist the Company in its’ public company filing requirements. The Company has agreed to compensate the FC Consultant $4,500 per month and to issue 333,334 shares of restricted common stock of the Company. The Company valued the shares at $0.30 per share (the market price of the common stock on the date of the agreement) and will amortize the cost over the one-year life of the agreement, accordingly, the Company recorded stock compensation expense of $75,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, and there remains a $25,000 balance of deferred stock compensation (in the equity section of the balance sheet herein) that will be amortized over the remaining term of the agreement. Under certain circumstances, the monthly fee can be reduced to $3,500 after the first six months of the FC Agreement. The FC Consultant was previously providing services for the Company. For the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, the Company expensed fees to the FC Consultant of $54,000 and $47,300 respectively.
 
On April 7, 2017, the Company entered into a Consulting and Representation Agreement (the “CR Agreement”), with a consultant (the “CR Consultant”). Pursuant to the CR Agreement the CR Consultant will assist the Company to broaden its visibility to the investing public. The Company has agreed to compensate the CR Consultant $700 per month and to issue 300,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock to the CR Consultant. The Company valued the shares at $0.30 per share (the market price of the common stock on the date of the agreement) and recorded stock compensation expense of $90,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The initial term was for fifteen (15) days with an automatic extension for one hundred seventy (170) days.

Effective December 1, 2017, the Company entered into a one-year Marketing Services Agreement (the “MSA”). Pursuant to the terms of the MSA, the Company will receive consulting and advisory services regarding the implementation of marketing programs, including the design and creation of commercial websites and commercialization of products through social media or other marketing methods. The Company will pay consideration for the services of $5,000 cash and $5,000 of common stock each month. The Company will issue the number of shares of common stock equal to a twenty-five percent (25%) discount to the lowest closing price of the common stock for the five (5) last trading days of the common stock for that month. The Company recorded 102,564 shares of common stock to be issued as of December 31, 2017 and recorded $8,974 of stock-based compensation expense (based on the market price on the date of the agreement) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The shares were issued on February 27, 2018.
 
On December 1, 2017, the Company entered into a three-month Consulting and Marketing Agreement (the “CMA”) with a third party. Pursuant to the terms of the CMA the Company will compensate the third-party $15,000 per month in consideration for consulting services related to development of business plans, corporate strategy and marketing.
 
On December 8, 2017, the Company entered in a month to month contract regarding investor relation services with a third-party for $3,600 per month beginning January 1, 2018. 
 
Competition
 
We have numerous direct, indirect and partial competitors, many of which have valuable industry relationships and access to greater resources than we do. There is no assurance that we will be able to provide services that will be competitive in the marketplace, and even if competitive, that we will be able to earn a profit.
 
The numerous types of direct or indirect competitors that exist in the market today include, but may not be limited to, sales and marketing firms, marketing consultants, design services, ad agencies, media buying firms, Internet marketing firms, online social media firms and others: Key competitors include Chicago Advertising & Marketing (CAM), a leader in direct marketing for the Hearing Aid Industry since 1995, Beeman Marketing, a marketing firm specializing in hearing care practitioners and audiologists since 2004, and Nutshell Marketing, a high quality direct response marketing firm specialized in targeting 55 and older age group.
 
Our Buying Group plan faces competition from major retail distributors and/or networks, as there is presently rapid growth of manufacturer-owned retail stores. Major consolidation has taken place in the US market by the hearing aid manufacturers in the last few years, with almost every manufacturer participating in buying out other smaller manufacturers, resulting in many different brand labels controlled under the same parent company umbrella. This consolidation has allowed the manufacturers to increase and control more of their distribution by offering different levels in their product lines throughout their different brands. This has also allowed the manufacturers to implement different price strategies for the same technology throughout their brands. This consolidation has not only increased their market share but also increased their profit margins.
 
The Internet is fast becoming a major factor in the distribution of hearing aids in the U.S. Numerous small companies are on the Internet advertising hearing aids for the cheapest price, and the largest hearing aid manufacturer, Sonova, which owns HearingPlanet, is most prominent among these online offerings. However, Internet sales still require the participation of a local practitioner for testing and fitting. This limits the widespread geographic appeal of Internet sales.
 
Technology and Development
 
We are equipped with three (3) G5 MacPros and one (1) iMac, which are up-to-date with the latest in software package from Adobe Creative Cloud and other graphic design software. We also utilize a large format printer and a production color printer to handle all proofing needs. All design and client information is held on a cloud computing network, which allows all designers and customer relation associates to access all design and customer files from on-site and off-site, to improve productivity and decrease lag time. Files are encrypted and password protected to make sure files are securely stored.

Intellectual Property
 
We have copyrights on all materials that are created or modified by any designers, which includes all conceptual and final artwork. Over the years, we have developed proprietary processes in how we manage our marketing programs; these processes are not protected by any patents but are covered by non-disclosure agreements executed with clients, consultants and employees. In the future we may utilize the services of contract developers, consultants, and/or third party personnel. Our success may depend in part upon our ability to preserve our trade secrets, obtain and maintain patent protection for our technologies, products and processes, and operate without infringing upon the proprietary right of other parties. However, we may rely on certain proprietary technologies, trade secrets, and know-how that are not patentable. Although we may take action to protect our unpatented trade secrets and our proprietary information, in part, by the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and certain of our contractors, we cannot guarantee that:

(a) | these agreements will not be breached;
----+---------------------------------------


(b) | we would have adequate remedies for any breach; or 
----+-------------------------------------------------------


(c) | our proprietary trade secrets and know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed or discovered by competitors. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We cannot guarantee that our actions will be sufficient to prevent imitation or duplication of either our products or services by others or prevent others from claiming violations of their trade secrets and proprietary rights.
 
Government Regulation.
 
We are subject to a limited variety of local, state, and federal regulations. While we believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable regulations, there can be no assurances that from time to time unintentional violations of such regulations will not occur. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulation applied to businesses, such as payroll taxes on the state and federal levels. Our current business requires that we comply with state corporate filings, city or county business license and the necessary business liability insurance. The requirements of these regulations are minimal and do not cause any undue burden.
 
Internet access and online services are not subject to direct regulation in the United States. Changes in the laws and regulations relating to the telecommunications and media industry, however, could impact our business. For example, the Federal Communications Commission could begin to regulate the Internet and online service industry, which could result in increased costs for us. The laws and regulations applicable to the Internet and to our services are evolving and unclear and could damage our business. There are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to, or commerce on, the Internet. Due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet, it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted, covering issues such as user privacy, defamation, pricing, taxation, content regulation, quality of products and services, and intellectual property ownership and infringement. Such legislation could expose us to substantial liability as well as dampen the growth in use of the Internet, decrease the acceptance of the Internet as a communications and commercial medium, or require us to incur significant expenses in complying with any new regulations.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2018, we have 5 employees.
