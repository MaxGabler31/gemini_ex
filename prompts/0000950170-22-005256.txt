 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 We have initiated a process to explore a range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value and have engaged professional advisors, including an investment banker to act as a strategic advisor for this process. Potential strategic alternatives that may be evaluated include a sale or merger of the Company or securing additional financing or partnerships that would enable further development of our programs. There can be no assurance that this strategic review process will result in our pursuing any transaction or that any transaction, if pursued, will be completed. We aim to run this strategic review process into mid-April 2022. Additionally, there can be no assurances that any particular course of action, business arrangement or transaction, or series of transactions, will be pursued, successfully consummated or lead to increased stockholder value. If the strategic process is unsuccessful, our Board may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation. In the event of such liquidation or other wind-down event, holders of our securities will likely suffer a total loss of their investment.
 We are a clinical-stage healthcare company with a differentiated, chemistry-driven approach focused on leveraging the microbiome to treat disease and improve human health. We have built a human-centric proprietary product platform for discovery and development that we believe will enable the advancement of a broad portfolio of novel product candidates. Our product candidates are Microbiome Metabolic Therapies (“MMT” or “MMTs”) which are designed to modulate the metabolic output and profile of the microbiome by driving the function and composition of existing microbes. We have an industrialized approach to the discovery and development of MMTs, and our initial MMTs are targeted glycans. Each targeted glycan is an ensemble of complex carbohydrates that is intended to modulate microbial metabolism and community composition to drive a specific biological response. We believe our MMTs have the potential to be novel treatments across a variety of diseases and conditions.
 
The human microbiome is generally a community of more than 30 trillion microbes, organisms that include bacteria, viruses, archaea and fungi, which reside on and inside the human body. By evolving together over thousands of years, microbes and humans have developed an intricate and mutually beneficial relationship. Given the profound impact that microbes have on human health, this highly complex microbial ecosystem has been referred to as a “newly discovered organ.” There is a growing body of research that links a healthy microbiome with overall human health, while dysbiosis, or imbalance, in the microbiome has been correlated with numerous human conditions including those that cause significant morbidity and mortality. Some of these conditions include irritable bowel syndrome, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cancer, allergies and ulcerative colitis.
 To date, therapeutic approaches to the microbiome have focused primarily on adding or subtracting bacteria, either through fecal microbiota transplant, the introduction of a consortia of bacteria, single strain approaches or antibiotics. We believe our approach is novel in that we seek to deliver MMTs that drive the function and

distribution of the gut microbiome’s existing microbes, enabling an industrialized approach to treat disease and improve human health.
 We have developed proprietary synthetic chemistry technologies that allow us to create MMT candidates. We believe the key characteristics of our MMT candidates include that they are orally administered, have limited systemic exposure and are selectively metabolized, structurally diverse, readily scalable, novel and proprietary. We believe that each of our MMT candidates works through one or more mechanisms of action, including selectively targeting the resident microbiome to restore gut-immune homeostasis.
 Utilizing our proprietary product platform, we have created a library of more than 1,500 MMT candidates to probe the structure-activity relationships of our MMTs. Our MMT candidates and aspects of the proprietary product platform are supported by our expanding intellectual property portfolio, that includes fifteen U.S. patents, four European Patent Office, or EPO, patents and more than 115 non-provisional applications pending worldwide.
 
Through the use of our proprietary product platform, the effect of MMTs is first tested ex vivo using a highly multiplexed advanced screening platform with microbiome communities from both healthy and patient populations. To establish how MMTs impact therapeutically relevant pathways, a broad range of bioanalytical technologies are used to analyze metabolites, effector molecules and host responses, while sequencing determines key microbial community changes. A candidate MMT may then either undergo further testing in animal models or go straight into clinical evaluation in humans.
Abbreviated development may be possible because in some cases MMTs are synthesized from naturally occurring carbohydrate monomers, are orally administered with limited systemic exposure and can be designated as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS). This enables us to gain valuable insights into our MMT candidates’ effects on the microbiome and human health before choosing to allocate additional time and capital to proceed to develop a drug product candidate under an IND or regulatory equivalent outside the United States. In August 2021, we received a warning letter from the FDA for failure to submit an IND prior to conducting two clinical studies, K031 and K032, of KB109 in subjects with COVID-19. Receipt of this warning letter raises doubt that we will be able to conduct future clinical studies of our product candidates utilizing this pathway.
 We, and our wholly owned subsidiaries, Cadena Bio, Inc. and Kaleido Biosciences Securities Corporation (collectively referred to as the “Company”) were incorporated in Delaware on January 27, 2015 and have a principal place of business in Lexington, Massachusetts.


Our Strategy
 Our immediate strategy is to:
 •Continue our strategic process to explore strategic alternatives. We have initiated a process to explore a range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value and have engaged professional advisors, including an investment bank, to act as strategic advisors for this process. Potential strategic alternatives that may be evaluated include a sale or merger of the Company or securing additional financing or partnerships that would enable further development of our programs. There can be no assurance that this strategic review process will result in our pursing any transaction or that any transaction, if pursed, will be completed. We aim to run this strategic review process into mid-April 2022.
 
In the event that our strategic process is successful, key elements of our strategy are to:
 •Harness the insights and data generated through our human-centric proprietary product platform to efficiently and rapidly advance a pipeline of MMTs to ultimately deliver products that address significant unmet patient needs.
•Leverage our differentiated approach, knowledge and unique expertise to lead efforts to expand the scientific understanding of the microbiome and its impact on human health.
•Advance pipeline programs in disease areas with an established connection between the microbiome and the disease. 
 •Selectively enter into strategic partnerships to maximize the value of our platform and pipeline.
•Further strengthen and expand our intellectual property portfolio.
•Build on our foundation of people who are committed to scientific innovation, transforming lives and fostering a strong culture. 
 Our Approach
 Due to the rapid nature of bacterial growth, the microbiome is inherently amenable to swift change, and it can be readily modulated using existing approaches, such as changes in diet and treatment with antibiotics. Importantly, because microbes in the gut can thrive on compounds, in particular glycans, that are generally not bioavailable to humans, effective targeted modulators of microbial metabolism should have low bioavailability and low systemic exposure. As a result, we believe that targeted modulators will likely have limited off-target activity in humans compared with traditional pharmaceutical agents.
 Our MMTs
 We have developed proprietary synthetic chemistry technologies that we believe allow us to create our MMT candidates. MMTs are novel synthetic glycans that serve as metabolic and growth substrates for the microbiome. We believe the key characteristics of our MMT candidates include the following:
 •Orally administered — Our MMT candidates are highly soluble and are orally administered.
 •Limited systemic exposure — Our MMT candidates have been observed to have limited systemic exposure after oral administration, minimizing off-target biological effects.


•Selectively metabolized — We design MMT candidates that are selectively metabolized by bacteria in the microbiome through the use of specialized enzymes. Species of gut bacteria are ecologically differentiated by their abilities to metabolize different glycans, making glycan delivery a powerful way to specifically modulate the composition, activity and metabolic output of the microbiome and improve host health.
 •Structurally diverse — Our MMT candidates are not a single, structurally-defined molecule, but rather an ensemble of molecules with a variety of structures. This structural complexity and specificity of action differentiates MMTs from any individual dietary fiber, and we believe that this is the primary factor for their differentiated microbiome activity.
 •Readily scalable — Our MMT candidates are produced using proprietary, standard small molecule unit operations. These methods have been proven scalable.
 •Novel and proprietary — Our MMT candidates are protected by what we believe to be a robust intellectual property portfolio, including by composition of matter and method of use patents.
 We believe that our MMT candidates work through one or more mechanisms of action that may have profound effects on human health in a variety of diseases and adverse conditions, including by selectively targeting the resident microbiome to restore gut-immune homeostasis.
 MMT Synthesis
 We synthesize MMT candidates using our proprietary chemistry technologies, which take advantage of the reactivity of carbohydrates and utilize defined mixtures of monosaccharides or polysaccharides as starting materials. We have methodically explored this approach to create a library of initial MMT candidates that vary across a wide range of structural features, including molecular weight, branching, regiochemistry and stereochemistry. By changing certain conditions and parameters, we can generate MMT candidates that have both larger and smaller variances on these structural features. The resulting MMT candidate library can then be used to explore the impact that structure has on the biology of the microbiome. We continue to develop other novel approaches to synthesize MMT candidates.
 We have made extensive commitments to discovering cost-effective and proprietary synthetic methods that can produce MMT candidates that drive diverse microbial responses. We believe our computational capabilities enable robust, efficient structural characterization and cross-batch comparison, reducing laborious manual processing steps typically required to determine the structure of complex carbohydrates.
 
We developed an ex vivo assay that allows the efficient and highly multiplexed screening MMT candidates using healthy volunteer and patient microbiomes. This unique screening and lead-identification process combines advances in drug discovery with microbiome science and is designed to measure the impact of MMTs on a variety of endpoints. To date, we have employed this process to screen a majority of our more than 1,500 MMT candidates for their ability to modulate bacterial metabolites with a documented role in the microbiome-host cross talks underlying the risk for, onset of and progression of disease. In addition, we have deployed this to measure, bacterial growth and community composition. Typically, after screening our library in microbiome samples from healthy volunteers, we test the identified lead compounds in samples from the patient population of interest. This provides the evidence needed to progress directly into clinical studies in healthy subjects, and in many cases, directly into patients or employ additional clinically relevant animal models. Furthermore, we utilize specific in vitro as well as animal models to test hypothesis on mechanism of action.
 Rapid advancement into human clinical studies
 Regulatory approach: food and drug
 Our regulatory approach to developing MMT candidates utilizes clinical research under both food law and drug law. Under this approach, human data is collected earlier in the process as compared to traditional drug development and data collected under both clinical studies and clinical trials may be included in regulatory filings, including filings for marketing approval. The MMT candidates we have been evaluating for use in modulating the microbiome can be classified as food or as drug ingredients depending upon their intended use. When intended for nutrient use to affect the structure or function of the body, they are conventional food or dietary supplement ingredients. For the dietary management of disease, the MMTs could be developed as medical foods. When intended for the prevention, cure, diagnosis or treatment of disease, they are drug candidates. We have initially studied several of our MMT candidates

following food regulation and guidance. These clinical studies are run under guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) and collect similar data as studies run under an IND or CTA. Therefore, these data can support filing an IND at Phase 2 or later, with the ultimate decision based on discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or comparable foreign regulatory authorities.
 Food substances for human use are regulated by the FDA to assure that intended exposures are safe in the general population. This assurance can be provided by a food additive regulation, or by determination by qualified experts that the substance is Generally Recognized as Safe (“GRAS”).
 Although food additives must be evaluated by the FDA’s Office of Food Additive Safety through a food additive petition prior to human use, this requirement excludes “substances that are generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate their safety as having been adequately shown to be safe under the conditions of their intended use.” This can be established through a GRAS determination.
 For a substance to be determined to be GRAS, the scientific data and information about its use must be widely known, and there must be a consensus among qualified experts that data and information establish that the substance is safe under the conditions of its intended use and that it meets the standard of “reasonable certainty of no harm.”
 A GRAS determination by qualified experts is sufficient to support clinical studies of food in humans. We rely on qualified experts from scientific consulting organizations that are highly experienced in conducting both GRAS evaluations to conduct initial safety assessments of our MMT candidates. These third-party assessments evaluate whether our MMTs are safe for intended use in human clinical studies that are intended to evaluate safety and tolerability and the effects of our MMTs on the structure and function of the microbiome. The resulting conclusion that a substance is GRAS is called a self-determination of GRAS.
Our MMT candidates have been observed to have limited systemic exposure after oral administration, minimizing off-target biological effects. The direct adverse effects that we have observed to date are limited to the symptoms associated with bacterial metabolism when orally administered, such as bloating, flatulence, abdominal cramping and pain and diarrhea, and not those generally associated with systemic exposure. These symptoms are the known dose limiting side effects, and they are localized and generally found to be mild and transient. We believe that we can achieve significantly higher doses with our MMT candidates before triggering dose-limiting side effects, unlike naturally occurring complex carbohydrates, which often result in tolerability challenges at even moderate dosage levels.
 When a food substance is intended for the diagnosis, cure, treatment or prevention of disease, then it is regulated as a drug ingredient. If our corporate strategy supports development of an MMT as a drug product, we will need to file an IND with FDA and obtain IND clearance from the FDA before commencing therapeutic clinical trials. An IND requires submission of additional information, including the information that supports the safety of the product for the intended population to be studied and planned exposure, non-clinical toxicology, details of the manufacturing and testing, and clinical protocols describing the proposed human therapeutic clinical trial(s). Equivalent requirements apply for drug clinical studies to be conducted outside the U.S.
 
Ulcerative Colitis
 Disease overview
 Ulcerative colitis (“UC”) is a chronic disease of the large intestine, in which the lining of the colon becomes inflamed and develops tiny open sores, or ulcers. Those ulcers produce pus and mucus, cause abdominal pain and result in the need to frequently empty the colon. UC is the result of several factors that are not yet well understood. Abnormal immune response, genetics, microbiome, and environmental factors all contribute to the disease. There is no medical cure for UC and it can occur at any age, though most people are diagnosed prior to their mid-30s. In the United States, approximately one million people are affected with UC. The disease symptoms vary from person to person and over half of all UC patients experience mild-to-moderate symptoms. Reported symptoms include loose stool and urgent bowel movements, bloody stool, abdominal cramps and pain, and persistent diarrhea accompanied by abdominal pain and blood in the stool.


Currently available therapies
 There is no known curative treatment for the disease. Treatment is multifaceted and includes the use of medication, alterations in diet and nutrition, and sometimes surgical procedures to repair or remove affected portions of a patient’s gastrointestinal tract.
 Several types of medication can be used to suppress UC symptoms (induce remission) and decrease the frequency of symptom flares (maintain remission) including anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, and biologics. UC is often a progressive disease meaning that over time patients respond less to a specific medication and need to progress to other treatments.
 Ulcerative Colitis and KB295
 Evidence suggests that a feature of UC is alteration of the gut microbiome, including an increase in pro-inflammatory bacteria and decrease in commensal diversity which interfere with the normal immune response. In ex vivo studies, KB295 has demonstrated the ability to increase the production of short chain fatty acids and suppress the growth of inflammatory bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae.
We conducted a non-IND clinical study evaluating MMT candidate KB295 in patients with mild-to-moderate UC. In this non-IND open label, single arm clinical study patients with mild-to-moderate UC received KB295 for eight weeks titrated up to 40g twice daily and then enter a one-month follow-up period. The study evaluated the safety and tolerability of KB295 and other assessments including the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index composite score, changes in microbiome composition and biomarkers of inflammation.

Infections caused by pathogenic bacteria including multi-drug resistant strains
 Scientific rationale
 Gut commensal bacteria minimize colonization of potential pathogens and maintain the intestinal barrier, thus preventing pathogen translocation to the bloodstream and other organs that ultimately causes infection. A diverse microbiome has been associated with numerous positive health outcomes. The administration of chemotherapy or antibiotics reduces diversity of the microbiome, interfering with its ability to perform these critical protective functions. We believe one potential way to restore the diversity of commensal bacteria is through administration of MMTs that can be metabolized exclusively by commensal bacteria, but not by pathogens. This strategy may therefore increase the diversity and biomass of the commensal microbiota and lead to a reduction in the abundance of pathogens. MMTs thus represent an antibiotic-sparing approach with no known mechanism of resistance for the fight against infectious disease caused by MDR bacteria.
 Disease overview
 Multi-drug resistant (“MDR”) pathogens are a significant and growing global health threat. In the United States alone, antibiotic resistant bacteria cause infections in more than 2.8 million people per year, and this number is growing. As antibiotics become less effective for the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases, infections that were once easily managed have become progressively more difficult to treat. Patients who develop MDR infections consume more healthcare resources and have a higher mortality rate than patients infected with non-resistant strains of the same bacteria.
 The risk of MDR pathogen colonization is significantly increased in patients with compromised immune systems, those on long term antibiotics, and those with protracted hospitalizations. Our initial focus is in patients scheduled to undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (“HSCT”), a population at high risk of infection in addition to other pathologies where the microbiome is documented to have an impact (Febrile neutropenia, Graft-versus-host-disease). HSCT is used for the treatment of cancer and certain autoimmune diseases. Bacterial infections are common after HSCT, due to pre-transplant immune system ablation. The use of prophylactic antibiotics was instituted to reduce the rate of such infections; however careful studies of mortality have shown that their use is associated with a significantly increased rate of death. Patients with low microbiome diversity had a significantly greater mortality than those maintaining a high diversity (67% vs 36% mortality at three years). This is thought to be mediated by the adverse effect the antibiotics have on the microbiome. The dysbiotic microbiome in turn facilitates colonization with pathogenic organisms, which may then lead to infection. These infections are a significant cause of patient mortality, excluding mortality due to the primary disease. In the United States, approximately 23,000 patients undergo HSCT each year.

Currently available therapies
While there are no treatments currently approved for prevention of infections in patients scheduled to receive HSCT, some clinicians treat patients prophylactically with an antibiotic from one of several classes, such as quinolones, beta-lactams or glycopeptides. If a patient develops an infection, they are treated empirically with antibiotics based on the likely organism and site of infection. While a significant number of antibiotics are commercially available, delays in treating an infection with an effective antibiotic is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and some MDR infections have limited or no effective treatment options.
MMT candidates—KB109 and KB174
 KB109 and KB174 are the MMT candidates for development as a potential prevention of infections caused by MDR bacteria. Nomination of these candidates resulted from their performance relative to a wide range of other MMTs in ex vivo screening of microbiome samples from healthy volunteers, as well as microbiome samples from intensive care unit patients in an experimental set-up that specifically focused on determining the potential of MMTs to decrease the relative abundance of a panel of pathogenic bacteria.
The initial opportunity is to prevent systemic infections in patients undergoing HSCT. Prophylactic treatment with antibiotics lowers gut microbiome diversity and is associated with a higher mortality rate after HSCT. KB109 is a non-antibiotic approach that is hypothesized to selectively enhance the growth of beneficial gut bacteria at the expense of pathogens (e.g. carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae, Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae) which may then reduce the risk of subsequent infection. Prior to studying patients undergoing HSCT, we initiated a first-in-human clinical trial in medically stable patients colonized with MDR pathogens but this study was terminated due to enrollment challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the desire to utilize KB109 for our COVID-19 studies.
Future pipeline opportunities
 If sufficient funding were available, we could pursue a number of opportunities beyond our initial pipeline. Our proprietary product platform is designed to generate the knowledge and insights required to support discovery and development work in a wide range of areas, including where evidence of a link to the microbiome exists but the biology is not yet fully defined. We believe that these areas of more complex microbiome-human biology present an opportunity to leverage our human-centric discovery and development approach and computational expertise.
 We have or have had programs in discovery, including work in ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, atopic immune disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ("COPD"), pathogens, and immuno--oncology. Correlative data has been published for each of these areas suggesting that the microbiome plays a critical role, and our discovery efforts have been largely focused on either establishing a mechanistic hypothesis or establishing and optimizing an ex vivo screen to address these opportunities. Some of this work has been conducted through collaborations, including with Institute Gustave Roussy in Paris exploring the potential of MMTs to improve the outcome of immune checkpoint inhibitor (“ICI”) treatment, with Jeffrey Gordon at Washington University (St. Louis) studying the mechanisms by which selected MMT candidates are metabolized by the gut microbiome and the impact on key functions in the host, and with Janssen focusing on decreasing the risk of the development of child-onset atopic diseases, including food allergies. We will advance MMT candidates once identified for future pipeline opportunities.
 As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, given the strategic process we are running, our active development initiatives are extremely limited.
 Manufacturing
 We have developed proprietary methods for the manufacture of MMT candidates that we believe are scalable and transferable to current good manufacturing practice requirements (“cGMP”). Our MMT candidates are synthesized and isolated using standard small molecule unit operations. The manufacturing process produces bulk MMT candidates suitable for oral administration in a variety of forms, including liquids and spray dried powders in sachets. In addition, we have established robust analytical methods to assess the identity and purity of our MMT

candidates. We believe that these controlled manufacturing processes and analytical methods will allow us to produce and release cGMP batches of material with consistent quality.
 We would rely on third-party manufacturers for the GMP production of larger quantities of MMT candidates for clinical trials.
While we do not have a current need for commercial scale manufacturing capacity, at the appropriate time we intend to evaluate options for further engaging our existing third-party manufacturers and/or building our own pharmaceutical grade cGMP internal capabilities.
 Intellectual property
 Overview
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates and discovery platform. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to pharmaceutical compositions, methods of treatment, methods of manufacture or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates, as well as discovery based on our proprietary product platform. Our level of success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce any patents that we may obtain, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our programs and product candidates.

 Patent portfolio
 Our patent portfolio includes patent applications in varying stages of prosecution in the United States and selected jurisdictions outside of the United States. As of March 31, 2022, our patent portfolio in total consisted of fifteen issued U.S. patents, four issued European patents, twenty-two issued patents in other jurisdictions (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore and South Africa), and over 115 pending non-provisional applications (U.S., EP and other jurisdictions), which include claims directed to compositions, methods of use and manufacturing processes. All patents are owned by us. Certain patents and patent applications described above are licensed exclusively to Midori USA, Inc. for use in the animal health field.
 The patent portfolio includes patents and applications (numbers for U.S. and Europe only) with claims directed to the following:
 MMT platform
 We own seven issued U.S. patents (U.S.11,169,101; 10,752,705; 10,131,721; 9,205,418; 9,079,171; 8,476,388; and 8,466,242), two issued EP patents (EP 3071235 and EP 2681247), and several pending patent families (with national, non-provisional applications) containing composition of matter, method of making and use claims related to our MMT platform and KB195, KB174, KB109, and KB295. The issued patents in the earliest of these families are expected to expire in 2032, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions.

COVID-19
 We own one pending PCT application containing composition of matter, method of treatment and use claims related to our COVID-19 program and KB109. The issued patents in the earliest of these families are expected to expire in 2038, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions.
Ulcerative Colitis
 We own one issued U.S. patent (U.S. 10,881676), pending national, non-provisional applications containing composition of matter, method of treatment and use claims related to our ulcerative colitis program and KB295. The issued patents in the earliest of these families are expected to expire in 2036, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions.
Urea Cycle Disorders ("UCD") and Hepatic Encephalopathy ("HE")
 We own one issued U.S. patent (U.S. 9,901,595), and several pending national, non-provisional application containing composition of matter, method of treatment and use claims related to our UCD and HE programs and KB195 and KB174. The issued patents in the earliest of these families are expected to expire in 2036, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions.
Pathogen
 We own two issued U.S. patents (U.S. 10,314,853; 9,757,403), one issued EP patent (EP 3071235), and several pending national, non-provisional applications containing method of treatment and use claims related to our pathogen program. The issued patents in the earliest of these families are expected to expire in 2036, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions.

Patent term
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the U.S., the base term is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent. The term of a U.S. patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of such an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or fourteen years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug, and a patent cannot be extended more than once or for more than a single product. During the period of extension, if granted, the scope of exclusivity is limited to the approved product for approved uses. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency.
 If and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply, if appropriate, for patent term extension on patents directed to those product candidates, their methods of use and/or methods of manufacture. However, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”


Trade secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, strong competition and an emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial competition from many different sources, including larger pharmaceutical companies with more resources. Specialty biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies, as well as public and private institutions are also potential sources of competitive products and technologies. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates will include efficacy, safety profile, method of administration, cost, level of promotional activity and intellectual property protection.
 The field of microbiome drug development is rapidly evolving and although there are currently many bacterial product candidates in development by companies that target the microbiome, we believe that we have a differentiated approach and do not consider ourselves to be in competition with these bacterial microbiome approaches.
 Although our novel chemistry approach is unique from most other existing or investigational therapies across the disease areas where our development is focused, we will need to compete with all currently or imminently available therapies in these areas. We are aware of marketed and investigational products in each of our leading disease areas.
 Government regulation
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval (when required), advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs such as those we are developing as well as dietary non-drug products and foods. We, along with our contract research organizations and contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval for our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs for therapeutic indications or commercialization of non-drug products and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.


In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products as well as dietary non-drug products such as foods under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”), its implementing regulations and other laws. At this time none of our MMTs have been approved by the FDA for marketing for therapeutic indications in the United States or been authorized for use as a food or medical food. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during product development, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning or untitled enforcement letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 We anticipate that the process required by FDA for our MMT candidates to be marketed in the United States as drugs for therapeutic indications will generally involve the following:
 •completion of preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice (“GLP”) requirements;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND application;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, GCP requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations, including approval by an IRB or independent ethics committee at each trial site, to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
 •submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”), including payment of user fees and acceptance by the FDA of the NDA;
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA;
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
 •compliance with ay post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

 To date, we have not elected a product candidate to develop and market as a food and may elect never to do so. If we decide to develop one or more of our MMTs as a conventional food product, we will have to follow regulations applicable to food uses.
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities, including the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), regulate the manufacturing, preparation, quality control, import, export, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, safety, and adverse event reporting of conventional foods. Among other things, manufacturers of conventional foods and medical foods must meet relevant cGMP, and certain requirements that govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding of foods.


With certain exceptions, clinical investigations in which an investigational drug is administered to human subjects must be conducted under an IND, as required by FDA regulations. The FDA has published a guidance document for clinical investigators, sponsors, and IRBs, Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) — Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND, that provides the FDA’s thinking on when an IND is required for human research studies. FDA’s interpretation of its regulations, as articulated in this guidance, do not require human testing of food, dietary supplements, or GRAS substances to be conducted under an IND unless such testing is intended to evaluate the product’s ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease or condition. FDA specifically recognizes an IND will not be required when a study is designed to “evaluate the tolerability of a food in a specific susceptible population, including individuals with a disease in a diseased population,” provided the study is not designed to evaluate the product’s ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease or condition. There is no assurance that FDA’s thinking on this matter will not change, and if it does, FDA may decide to take enforcement action against testing of GRAS substances that it believes should be conducted under an IND, or the FDA may delay or deny an IND submitted with supporting data from human studies not conducted under an IND, or require alternate or additional data to support such an IND before authorizing an applicant to proceed.
 Additionally, depending on the circumstances, the use of a substance in certain clinical investigations may restrict the marketing of such substance in food. Section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act prohibits the marketing of any food to which has been added a drug or biologic for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, unless the substance was marketed in food before any substantial clinical investigations involving the drug or biologic were instituted or one of the other exceptions in section 301(ll) applies. Marketing the substance of interest in food before seeking an IND or beginning any clinical investigations preserves the option to continue to market the substance in those forms after substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and their existence has been made public.
 The FDA may classify some or all of our potential product candidates as containing a food additive that is not GRAS. Such classification would cause these product candidates to require pre-market approval for a food additive regulation, which could substantially delay or prevent the commercialization of these product candidates for non-drug uses. Any delay in the regulatory consultation process, or a determination that any of our drug or food product candidates do not meet regulatory requirements of FDA, including any applicable GRAS requirements, could cause a delay in the commercialization of our product candidates, which may lead to reduced acceptance by the public or others or an inability to commercialize those candidates at all.
 FDA regulation of medical food uses
 In parallel with our development of MMT product candidates for therapeutic indications, we are exploring the development of some of our product candidates as medical food products. To date, we have not elected a product candidate to develop and market as a medical food and may elect never to do so.
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities, including the FTC also regulate the manufacturing, preparation, quality control, import, export, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, safety, and adverse event reporting of medical foods. Among other things, manufacturers of medical foods must meet relevant cGMP and certain requirements that govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding of foods.
 Preclinical and clinical trials for drugs
 Once a product candidate is identified for development as a drug, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to evaluate the potential for adverse events, which must be conducted in accordance with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data as well as the results of our human clinical studies, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting before each clinical trial can begin.


Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human volunteers under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol for our product candidates for therapeutic indications must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IRB for each investigator site proposing to participate in a clinical trial must also review and approve the clinical trial before it can begin at that site. The FDA’s regulations provide additional safeguards for pediatric subjects enrolled in clinical trials of investigational products. For example, under the FDA’s regulations, a clinical investigation involving greater than minimal risk to children but that presents the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects may involve pediatric subjects only if the IRB finds that the risk is justified by the anticipated benefit to the subjects, the relation of the anticipated benefit to the risk is at least as favorable to the subjects as that presented by available alternative approaches, and adequate provisions are made for soliciting the consent of the pediatric subjects and the permission of their parents and guardians. Further, the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing of product candidates for therapeutic indications also must satisfy extensive GCP requirements, including requirements for informed consent.
 Human clinical trials for therapeutic indications are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In certain circumstances, where sufficient evidence of safety and tolerability are collected from preclinical studies and other human experience with a product, such as our human clinical studies, we believe a human clinical trial may begin as late as Phase 3.
 •Phase 1 — Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, excretion the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
 •Phase 2 — Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
 •Phase 3 — Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or a Biologics License Application. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. Furthermore, if a designated orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the rare disease or condition for which it received orphan designation, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity.


Expedited development and review programs for drugs
 The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life- threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to either expedite the development or review of important new drugs to get them to patients earlier than under standard FDA development and review procedures.
 A new drug or biologic is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, as well as Priority Review, discussed below. In addition, a new drug or biologic may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review designation and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under Priority Review, FDA must review an application in six months compared to ten months for a standard review. Additionally, products are eligible for accelerated approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. In addition, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, that all advertising and promotional materials that are intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period, and that after 120 days following marketing approval, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or review process.
 U.S. marketing approval for drugs
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing of our product candidates for drug uses, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. An NDA is a request for approval to market a new drug for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the United States.

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. An Agreed Initial Pediatric Study Plan requesting a waiver from the requirement to conduct clinical studies has been submitted to the FDA.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are compliant with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the Sponsor product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including any inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 U.S. post-approval requirements for drugs
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other potential consequences up to and including revocation of product approvals.


Other regulatory matters
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the FTC, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
 Packaging and distribution in the United States
 If our products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 Other U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations
 We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
 We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
 In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. Factors that payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:
 •a covered benefit under its health plan; 


•safe, effective and medically necessary; 
 •appropriate for the specific patient; 
 •cost-effective; and 
 •neither experimental nor investigational.
 The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the Company placing the medicinal product on the market. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 Other Healthcare and Privacy Laws
 Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.
 •The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, provide or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order, arrangement or prescription of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Violations of this law are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute.
 •Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, and civil monetary penalty laws including the federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program; or knowingly making a false statement or record material to payment of a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or knowingly concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, with respect to drug products, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product, or promoting a product off-label. Claims that include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False 


Claims Act. Any future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for drug products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law.
 •The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rules published January 2013, imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
 •The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for information related to certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. 
 •Federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs.
 •Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
 •Analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payor. These laws are enforced by various state agencies and through private actions. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies implement compliance to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts. Data privacy and security laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions may also be more stringent than those in the United States (such as the European Union, which adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018).
 

Current and Future Healthcare Reform Legislation
 
In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In particular, in 2010 the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, subjected biologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars; addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs; created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business.
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, by increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and closing the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,” which will shift costs for name brand drugs away from Part D participants back to the manufacturers, which could have a negative effect on our profits in the event any of our products receive FDA approval and CMS reimbursement. Similarly, CMS recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Additionally, CMS has finalized a rule that would amend the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit regulations to reduce out of pocket costs for plan enrollees and allow Medicare plans to negotiate lower rates for certain drugs. In May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was became effective January 1, 2019.
 In addition, other legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted:
 •On August 2, 2011, the U.S. Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the temporary suspension, a 1% payment reduction will occur beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the 2% payment reduction will resume on July 1, 2022.
 •On January 2, 2013, the U.S. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.


•On April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
 •On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
 •On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
 On December 20, 2019, former President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future.
 Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. At the federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates would have been be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on December 29, 2021 CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nations rule. Additionally, on November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
 Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient

reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain drug access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Government regulation of drugs outside of the United States
 To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization or identification of an alternate regulatory pathway, manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For instance, in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) medicinal products must be authorized for marketing by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
 •Centralized procedure — If pursuing marketing authorization of a product candidate for a therapeutic indication under the centralized procedure, following the opining of the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines derived from biotechnology processes or advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EEA. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops.
 •National authorization procedures — There are also two other possible routes to authorize products for therapeutic indications in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
 •Decentralized procedure — Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
 •Mutual recognition procedure — In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, additional marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
 The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The CTA must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant

the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 The collection and use of personal health data in the European Union, previously governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, is now governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018. While the Data Protection Directive did not apply to organizations based outside the EU, the GDPR has expanded its reach to include any business, regardless of its location, that provides goods or services to residents in the EU. This expansion would incorporate any clinical trial activities in EU member states. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including special protections for “sensitive information” which includes health and genetic information of data subjects residing in the EU. GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States or other regions that have not been deemed to offer “adequate” privacy protections. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in fines of up to 4% of global revenues, or €20,000,000, whichever is greater. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules.
 There is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with GDPR. For example, it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the EU, or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated. Enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring GDPR compliance are onerous and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 Additionally, should we elect one or more product candidates to develop and market as non-therapeutic dietary non-drug products or food products in foreign countries, such products would also be subject to regulation under various national, local, and international laws that include provision governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising. These regulations may prevent or delay entry into the market or prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of certain of our non-therapeutic product candidates.
 The regulatory environment outside the United States varies and in general is less developed then in the United States, but some exceptions do exist. The regulatory requirements for nutritional non-drug products and food products outside of the United States varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Each jurisdiction may have its own regulatory framework regarding nutritional non-drug products and food products. The two leading jurisdictions, the United States and the Europe, currently have and may continue to in the future to have distinctly different regulatory regimes with different rules and requirements nutritional non-drug products and food products, with, for example, the European Union having a stronger process for claims review and preapproval for nutritional products. Regulation in Europe is exercised primarily through the European Union, which regulates the combined market of each of its member states. Other European countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to dietary products.
 We cannot predict how the global regulatory landscape regarding our possible nutritional non-drug products or food products, if any, will evolve and we may incur increased regulatory costs as regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate evolve or change. We cannot predict whether or when any jurisdiction will change its regulations with respect to any of our product candidates.
 Should we utilize third part distributors, compliance with such foreign governmental regulations would generally be the responsibility of such distributors, who may be independent contractors over whom we have limited control.
 Government regulation of food for special medical purpose in the European Union
 The regulatory requirements for foods for special medical purposes (“FSMPs”), in the European Union cover FSMP development and commercialization.
 In the European Union, FSMPs are designed to feed patients who, because of a particular disease, disorder or medical condition, have nutritional needs that cannot be met by consuming standard foodstuffs. European Union Regulation defines ‘ food for special medical purposes ’ as food specially processed or formulated and intended for

the dietary management of patients, including infants, to be used under medical supervision; it is intended for the exclusive or partial feeding of patients with a limited, impaired or disturbed capacity to take, digest, absorb, metabolize or excrete ordinary food or certain nutrients contained therein, or metabolites, or with other medically-determined nutrient requirements, whose dietary management cannot be achieved by modification of the normal diet alone.
 Businesses intending to commercialize FSMPs in the European Union are required to register their FSMPs by submitting notifications regarding FSMP use, demonstrating compliance with applicable European Union rules, prior to market commercialization. These notifications to competent authority of each European Union Member State include information appearing on the label, and any other information the competent authority may reasonably request to establish compliance with this Regulation.
 The European Commission may decide, by means of implementing acts (a) whether a given food falls within the scope of this Regulation; and (b) to which specific category of food a given food belongs. European Food Safety Authority Guidance provides, among other requirements, that the dossier must include an explanation of the scientific and medical basis on which it has been concluded that the use of the specific food product is necessary or is more practical or safer than the exclusive use of non-FSMP foodstuffs.
 FSMPs can also fall within the scope of the novel food legislation in the European Union. Where an ingredient used in the FSMP to be marketed in the European Union falls within the definition of a ‘novel food ingredient’ prior authorization for use of the ingredient needs to be sought. A “novel” food or food ingredients as food that has not been consumed to a significant degree by humans in the European Union before May 15, 1997 and that falls within one of the ten food categories listed. Novel foods and novel food ingredients can only be authorized if they do not pose a safety risk to human health, their intended use does not mislead the consumer and they do not differ from the food they are intended to replace in such a way that its normal consumption would be nutritionally disadvantageous for the consumer. The authorization procedure is likely to take between 12 and 18 months.
 In accordance with European Union clinical trials directives, before a clinical trial site is allowed to start enrolling patients in a clinical trial, the IRB or (IEC), must provide a positive opinion concerning the study protocol and all study-related materials. The competent authorities of the relevant European Union Member State must also provide their related authorization. Clinical trials involving the investigation of the action of non-medicinal products (e.g. foods, such as many FSMPs), are not covered and are not required to register the clinical trial or to complete a CTA for approval by an European Union Member State.

 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
 1. Nature of the Business, Basis of Presentation, and Going Concern
Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a clinical-stage healthcare company that was incorporated in Delaware on January 27, 2015 and has a principal place of business in Lexington, Massachusetts. The Company was formed to use its differentiated, chemistry-driven approach to leverage the potential of the microbiome to treat disease and improve human health.
The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, successful development of technology, obtaining additional funding, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations, risks of failure of preclinical studies (including ex vivo assays), clinical studies and clinical trials, the need to obtain marketing approval for its drug candidates and if applicable, its consumer products, fluctuations in operating results, economic pressure impacting therapeutic pricing, dependence on key personnel, risks associated with changes in technologies, development by competitors of technological innovations and the ability to supply sufficient amounts of its Microbiome Metabolic Therapies (“MMTs”) at an acceptable quality level.
On June 4, 2020, the Company completed a public offering (the “Offering”), pursuant to which it issued and sold 4,750,000 shares of the common stock. The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from the Offering were $33.2 million. On July 1, 2020, 185,000 shares were exercised under the Underwriter’s overallotment option for net proceeds of $1.3 million.
On August 4, 2020, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with a sales agent for the sale of up to $50.0 million of the Company’s shares of common stock, from time to time in an at-the-market public offering (the “ATM”). The sales agent is entitled to compensation at a fixed commission rate of 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company sold 361,299 shares of its common stock under the ATM which resulted in aggregate net proceeds of $3.4 million after payment of related commissions. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company has sold 309,656 shares of its common stock under the ATM which resulted in aggregate net proceeds of $4.9 million. As of December 31, 2021, there was $41.6 million available under the ATM.
On February 8, 2021, the Company completed a public offering (the “2021 Offering”) including the Underwriters’ overallotment option, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold 6,037,500 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $65.3 million.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company incurred net losses of $90.3 million and $81.6 million, respectively, and reported cash used in operations totaling $77.1 million and $61.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $38.5 million. Management believes the Company has sufficient cash and cash equivalents or borrowing capacity to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures into the beginning of the second quarter of 2022.

In January 2022, we enacted a restructuring plan to reduce our operations to preserve financial resources, resulting in a reduction of our workforce by up to 20 positions. As a result, we incurred costs of $280,000 that consisted of severance benefits for the affected employees and other restructuring costs.

On March 25, 2022, we entered into an amendment to our Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules, pursuant to which we made an immediate payment of $15 million of the Tranche 1 Advance without any prepayment penalty. This amendment also extended the interest only period of the term loan through April 1, 2023 and removed the minimum cash covenant that was previously in place.

Additionally, we have initiated a process to evaluate strategic alternatives in order to maximize shareholder value. There can be no assurance that this strategic review process will result in us pursuing any transaction or that any transaction, if pursued, will be completed on attractive terms or at all. We aim to run this process into mid-April 2022.
Based on its recurring losses from operations incurred since inception, expectation of continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future, and need to raise additional capital to finance its future operations, the Company has
 
concluded that there is substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
The Company will require substantial additional capital to fund its research and development and ongoing operating expenses. These capital requirements are expected to be funded through debt and equity offerings as well as possible strategic collaborations with other companies. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds when needed, it may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate its product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that the Company would otherwise prefer to develop and market itself.
A novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in late 2019, and subsequently declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. As a result of the outbreak, many companies have experienced disruptions in their operations and in markets served. The Company has instituted some and may take additional temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to its employees, including implementing a work-at-home policy, providing flexibility for working parents and suspending all business-related travel.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative United States generally accepted accounting principles as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”).

Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash includes cash in readily available checking accounts. The Company’s cash deposits on hand at one financial institution often exceed federally insured limits. Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments maturing within 90 days from the date of purchase.

Restricted Cash
Restricted cash is cash that is restricted as to withdrawal or use under the terms of certain contractual agreements. The restricted cash consists of cash collateral for secured letters of credit for the security deposit on the Company’s leased laboratory and office facilities.

Concentrations of Credit Risk and of Significant Suppliers
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 consisted only of money market funds. The Company does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships.
The Company relies, and expects to continue to rely, on a small number of vendors to manufacture supplies and raw materials for its development programs. These programs could be adversely affected by a significant interruption in these manufacturing services or the availability of raw materials.

Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Laboratory and office equipment, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over a period of five years, and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset’s estimated useful life or the remaining lease term. Major additions and betterments are capitalized; maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the life of the respective assets, are charged to operating expenses as incurred.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the carrying amounts of the assets to their undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value. The Company has not recorded any impairment charges in the periods presented.

Segment Information
Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the chief executive officer (“CEO”). The Company and CEO view the Company’s operations and manage its business as one operating segment.

Collaboration Revenue
The Company analyzes its collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements (ASC 808), to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards that are dependent on the commercial success of such activities. To the extent the arrangement is within the scope of ASC 808, the Company will assess whether aspects of the arrangement between it and their collaboration partner are within the scope of other accounting literature. If the Company concludes that some or all aspects of the arrangement represent a transaction with a customer, it will account for those aspects of the arrangement within the scope of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company applies the five-step model described below. If the Company concludes that some or all aspects of the arrangement are within the scope of ASC 808 and do not represent a transaction with a customer, the Company will recognize its allocation of the shared costs incurred with respect to the jointly conducted activities as a component of the related expense in the period incurred.
The Company recognizes revenue after applying the following five steps:


1) | Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer, 
2) | Identification of the performance obligations in the contract, including whether they are distinct within the context of the contract
3) | Determination of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration 
4) | Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 
5) | Recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied 


 

If a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at inception, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within such contract, determines which of those goods and services are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (that is, the good or service is capable of being distinct) and (ii) the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (that is, the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract). In assessing whether a promised good or service is distinct, the Company considers factors such as the research, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. The Company also considers the intended benefit of the contract in assessing whether a promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If a promised good or service is not distinct, an entity is required to combine that good or service with other promised goods or services until it identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct.

The Company may provide options to additional goods or services in such arrangements exercisable at a customer’s discretion. The Company assesses if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations. The identification of material rights requires judgments related to the determination of the value of the underlying good and services to the option exercise price.

The Company determines transaction price based on the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. Consideration may be fixed, variable, or a combination of both. The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices (“SSP”). SSP is determined at contract inception and is not updated to reflect changes between contract inception and when the performance obligations are satisfied. In developing the SSP for a performance obligation, the Company considers applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. 

If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, the Company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled by using the expected value method or the most likely amount method. The Company includes the unconstrained amount of estimated variable consideration in the transaction price. The amount included in the transaction price is constrained to the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price.

The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied, either at a point in time or over time, and if over time recognition is based on the use of an output or input method.
Amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. If the related performance obligation is expected to be satisfied within the next twelve months this will be classified in current liabilities. Amounts recognized as revenue prior to receipt are recorded as other current assets in the Company's balance sheets. If the Company expects to have an unconditional right to receive the consideration in the next twelve months, this will be classified in other current assets.


Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries and bonuses, stock‑based compensation, employee benefits, facilities costs, laboratory supplies, depreciation, manufacturing expenses and external costs of vendors engaged to conduct preclinical development activities and clinical trials, as well as the cost of licensing technology.
Upfront payments and milestone payments made for the licensing of technology are expensed as research and development in the period in which they are incurred. Advance payments for goods or services to be received in the
 
future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.

Research and Manufacturing Contract Costs and Accruals
The Company has entered into various research and development and manufacturing contracts. These agreements are generally cancelable, and related payments are recorded as the corresponding expenses are incurred. The Company records accruals for estimated ongoing costs. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, the Company analyzes progress of the research studies or clinical trials and manufacturing activities, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received and contracted costs. Significant judgments and estimates may be required in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from the Company’s estimates. The Company’s historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from the actual costs.

Patent Costs
All patent‑related costs incurred in connection with filing and prosecuting patent applications are expensed as incurred due to the uncertainty about the recovery of the expenditure. Amounts incurred are classified as general and administrative expenses.

Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount, which, more likely than not, will be realized.
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from any uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

Fair Value Measurements
Certain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:
•Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities.
•Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following:
•quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
•quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active
•observable inputs other than quoted prices that are used in the valuation of the asset or liabilities (e.g., interest rate and yield curve quotes at commonly quoted intervals)
•inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means
 
•Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the assets or liability (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). Level 3 inputs include management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk). The carrying amount of the Company’s other financial assets and liabilities including cash, accounts payable and long-term debt approximate fair value because of the relatively short period of time between origination and expected realization or settlement.

Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss is computed by adjusting net loss to reallocate undistributed earnings based on the potential impact of dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the diluted net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, including potential dilutive common shares assuming the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents.
The following table presents securities that have been excluded from the computations of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding as they would be anti-dilutive due to the net losses:

 | As of December 31, | 
 | 2021 | | 2020
Options to purchase common stock | | 7,151,081 | | 6,978,447
Unvested restricted stock units | | 233,287 | | 316,249 
 | | 7,384,368 | | 7,294,696


Stock-Based Compensation
For stock-based awards, the Company measures the estimated fair value of the stock-based award on the date of grant and recognizes compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. For stock-based awards with service-based vesting conditions, the Company records the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. For stock options with performance-based vesting conditions, the Company records the expense for these awards over the requisite service period using an accelerated attribution method to the extent the achievement of the performance condition is probable. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.

The Company classifies stock-based compensation expense in its consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient’s cash compensation costs are classified.

Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other changes in stockholders’ equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those with stockholders. The Company’s comprehensive net loss equals the reported net loss for all periods presented.

Subsequent events
The Company evaluates events and/or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date and before the issue date of the financial statements to determine if any of those events and/or transactions require adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements.

Accounting Pronouncements Issued and Not Yet Adopted
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”), which applies to all leases and will require lessees to record most leases on the balance sheet but recognize expense in a manner similar to the current standard. The Company will use a modified retrospective approach of adoption for leases.
 
The Company adopted the new leasing standard effective January 1, 2022, using the modified retrospective transition approach and utilizing the effective date as the date of initial application. As a result, prior periods will be presented in accordance with the previous guidance in ASC 840. The Company has elected to apply the package of practical expedients requiring no reassessment of whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, the lease classification of any expired or existing leases, or the capitalization of initial direct costs for any existing leases. In connection with the adoption of ASC 842, the Company will record a lease liability of $36.6 million related to its existing office lease and a corresponding right-of-use asset of $33.9 million. Existing deferred rent and prepaid rent amounts will be removed from the consolidated balance sheets at the date of adoption. The adoption of the standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet but will not have material impact to the Company's consolidated statements of operations or statement of cash flows.
3. Fair Value Measurements
The following tables set forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):

 | Fair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2021
 | Level 1 | | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total | 
Assets: | | | | | | 
Money market funds included within cash and cash equivalents | $ | 25,417 | | — | | — | $ | 25,417
Total | $ | 25,417 | | — | | — | $ | 25,417


 | Fair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2020
 | Level 1 | | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total | 
Assets: | | | | | | 
Money market funds included within cash and cash equivalents | $ | 45,410 | | — | | — | $ | 45,410
Total | $ | 45,410 | | — | | — | $ | 45,410


The fair value of money market funds was measured by the Company based on quoted market prices. There were no transfers among Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 categories in the periods presented.
Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value The carrying value of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses that are reported on the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates fair value as evidenced by the 2021 amendment to the loan and security agreement and the latest refinancing.

 4. Property and Equipment, net
Property and equipment consist of the following (in thousands):


 | As of December 31, | 
 | 2021 | | | 2020 | 
Laboratory equipment | $ | 7,438 | | | $ | 6,843 | 
Office and computer equipment | | 1,586 | | | | 1,590 | 
Leasehold improvements | | 1,922 | | | | 1,910 | 
Construction in process | | 190 | | | | 1,612 | 
Property and equipment – at cost | | 11,136 | | | | 11,955 | 
Less accumulated depreciation and amortization | | (5,471 | ) | | | (3,493 | )
Property and equipment – net | $ | 5,665 | | | $ | 8,462 | 


 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $2.4 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded gross fixed asset disposal of $1.6 million and related accumulated depreciation of $0.4 million. The Company also had a fixed asset sale with proceeds of $1.4 million of which $0.9 million was included in prepaid and other current assets as a receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded gross fixed asset disposal of $1.1 million and related accumulated depreciation of $0.9 million.

5. Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):


 | As of December 31, |

6. Debt Financing
2019 Credit Agreement
On December 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Hercules Capital, Inc. (the “Lender”). Under the Credit Agreement, the Company borrowed $22.5 million, and the Company has the option to draw down an additional $12.5 million if certain milestones and conditions are met. The Company incurred fees of $0.3 million, which was paid to the lender on the closing date. These amounts were recorded as a debt discount and are being amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also includes an end of term charge equal to 7.55% of the aggregate principal amount of all advances. The end of term charge, totaling $1.7 million at December 31, 2019, was recognized as a debt discount and is reflected as a reduction in the carrying value of the debt and recorded in other long-term liabilities. The debt discount created by the end of term charge is being accreted and will be recognized as additional interest expense over the term of the Credit Agreement using the effective interest method.

The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, covenants that limit or restrict the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate, make acquisitions, pay dividends or other distributions or repurchase equity, make investments, dispose of assets and enter into certain transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to certain exceptions. As security for its obligations under the Credit Agreement, the Company granted the Lender a first priority security interest on substantially all of the Company’s assets (other than intellectual property), and subject to certain exceptions.
The outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement has a 48-month term with interest only payments for the first 15 months, which period can be extended to up to 24 months, depending on the achievement of certain performance milestones. The principal bears an interest rate of equal to the greater of (i) 8.95% plus the prime rate minus 4.75% and (ii) 8.95%. The Credit Agreement includes mandatory prepayment provisions that require prepayment upon the occurrence of a change in control event.

On June 15, 2020, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the “Amendment”). The Amendment was entered into for the primary purpose of amending the Credit Agreement as follows: (i) the second tranche of the term loan (the “Term Loan”) is terminated; (ii) amounts available under Tranche 3 of the Term Loan is increased to $12.5 million from the previous $7.5 million availability amount and its availability period is extended through December 15, 2021, subject to future approval by the Agent’s investment committee; (iii) the interest-only period is extended through July 31, 2021; (iv) the interest rate on borrowings is increased by 0.4%, such that the per annum interest rate on outstanding borrowings will be the greater of (a) 9.35% and (b) 9.35% plus the Wall Street Journal prime rate minus 3.25%; (v) the variable amount and duration of a minimum cash covenant in the Agreement are amended. The interest rate at December 31, 2020 is 9.35%. The Amendment has been accounted for as a modification and the Company incurred fees of $79,000, which was paid to the lender on the closing date and were recorded as a debt discount, which will be amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method.
On April 30, 2021, the Company entered into a Third Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the "Third Amendment"). The Third Amendment was entered into for the primary purpose of amending the Credit Agreement as follows: (i) the interest-only period was extended through January 31, 2022; (ii) the second tranche for the term loan (the "Term Loan") was reinstated and the related $5 million was available to be drawn at the Company's option on or before June 1, 2021; and (iii) the Minimum Cash Covenant was reduced from $22.5 million to $15 million. The Company incurred fees of $20,000, which was paid to the Lender on the closing date and were recoded as debt discount, which will be amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method. The Company did not exercise its option to drawn down the second tranche of the term loan.

Future principal payments under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021 are as follows (in thousands): 


2022 | | 16,724
2023 | | 5,172 
2024 | | 604 
Total future principal payments | | 22,500
Less unamortized debt discount | | 806 
Total balance | $ | 21,694


On March 25, 2022, the Company entered into a Fourth Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement ("the Amendment"). The Amendment was entered into for the primary purpose of amending the Agreement as follows: (i) an immediate payment of $15 million of the Tranche 1 Advance without prepayment penalty, (ii) extended the interest only period of the term loan through April 1, 2023, (iii) removed the minimum cash covenant that was previously in place, and (iv) the ability to drawn down an additional $1.7 million tranche if Kaleido completes either an equity raise or convertible debt financing of at least $15 million of net cash proceeds following the close of the Amendment. The Company paid the immediate payment of $15 million to the lender on the closing date.
7. Commitments and contingencies
In March 2018, the Company entered into a non-cancelable ten-year lease agreement for laboratory and office space in Lexington, Massachusetts. In March 2019, the Company exercised its option to lease additional space in the building. The lease expires in 2029, subject to one option to extend the lease for 10 years.
Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $6.5 million and $6.9 million, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under the non-cancelable operating leases consisted of the following as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):


Year Ending December 31, | | 
2022 | | 6,207 
2023 | | 6,393

8. Stockholders’ Equity
Stock-based compensation
2019 Stock Incentive Plan
The Company’s 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”) provided for the Company to sell or issue incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, and other equity awards to employees, directors and consultants of the Company.
The 2019 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”) became effective in February 27, 2019. Upon effectiveness of the 2019 Plan, the remaining shares available under the 2015 Plan ceased to be available for issuance and no future issuances will be made under the 2015 Plan.
The 2019 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, unrestricted stock awards, cash-based awards and dividend equivalent rights to the Company’s officers, employees, directors and consultants. Awards generally vest over a period up to 4 years and have a maximum term of 10 years. The number of shares initially reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan is 2,168,976, has increased on January 1, 2020 and will continue to increase each January 1 thereafter by 4% of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31 or such lesser number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors or compensation committee of the board of directors. There were 3,930,009 shares available for future issuance at December 31, 2021.
2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2019 ESPP”) became effective on February 27, 2019. A total of 180,748 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under this plan.

Stock Option Valuation
The fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company historically has been a private company and lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded stock price. For options with service-based vesting conditions, the expected term of the Company’s stock options has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards that qualify as “plain-vanilla” options. The expected term of stock options granted to non-employees is equal to the contractual term of the option award. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

The Company typically grants stock options at exercise prices deemed by the Board to be equal to the fair value of the common stock at the time of grant. In the periods prior to the IPO, the fair value of the common stock has been determined by the Board at each measurement date based on a variety of different factors, including the results obtained from independent third-party appraisals, the Company’s financial position and historical financial performance, the status of development of the Company’s programs, the current climate in the marketplace, the illiquid nature of the common stock, the effect of the rights and preferences of the preferred stockholders, and the

prospects of a liquidity event, among others. In the periods following the IPO, the fair value is determined based upon the quoted price of the Company’s common stock.
The assumptions that the Company used to determine the grant-date fair value of options granted were as follows:


 | Years Ended December 31, | 
 | 2021 | | | 2020 
Expected volatility | 87.7% - 89.7% | | | 83.5% - 105.5%
Risk-free interest rate | 0.59% - 1.35% | | | 0.15% - 1.41% 
Expected term (in years) | 5.50-6.43 | | | 1.39-6.32 
Expected dividend yield | | — | % | | — | %

Stock- Based Compensation Expense
The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense in the following expense categories of its consolidated statements of operations:


 | Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2021 | | 2020 | 
Research and development | $ | 4,451 | | $ | 3,820

On January 20, 2021, the Company entered into a separation agreement with the former Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research and Development of the Company, which amended an existing employment agreement and provided for changes in the term of service and compensation under the agreement. The outstanding options and restricted stock units held by the former Chief Medical Officer were modified to accelerate certain vesting provisions and the period of exercisability. As a result, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $2.0 million related to the incremental fair value of the modified awards during the first quarter of 2021.

 
9. Income Taxes

There is no provision for income taxes because the Company has historically incurred net operating losses and maintains a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. The reported amount of income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 differs from the amount that would result from applying domestic federal statutory rates to pretax losses primarily because of changes in the valuation allowance, state taxes, and the generation of research and development credits.
Significant components of the Company’s net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:


 | Years ended December 31, | 
 | 2021 | | | 2020 | 
Deferred tax assets | | | | | 
Stock-based compensation | $ | 8,055 | | | $ | 5,484 | 
Net operating loss carryforwards | | 103,148 | | | | 64,939 |

Intangible assets | | 169 | | | | 164 | 
Charitable contributions | | 2 | | | | 1 | 
Accrued expenses | | 1,410 | | | | 1,314 | 
Total deferred tax assets | | 122,112 | | | | 79,890 |

A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate is as follows:


 | Years ended December 31, | 
 | 2021 | | | 2020
Federal income tax expense at statutory rate | | 21.0 | % | | 21.0 | %

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for U.S. federal and state tax purposes of $318.6 million and $348.4 million, respectively. Federal NOLs of $38.8 million, generated before 2018, will begin expiring in varying amounts in 2035 unless utilized and the remaining NOL of $279.8 million, generated after 2018 will be carried forward indefinitely and could be used up to 80% of taxable income of each future tax year. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts does not follow federal on NOL carryforwards and as such the Company’s Massachusetts NOLs of $271.6 million will expire in at various times starting in 2035. As of December 31, 2021, the Company also has federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $6.5 million, and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $3.6 million, which may be available to reduce future tax liabilities, and which expire at various dates through 2040.
The rules dealing with U.S. federal, state and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect our stockholders or us. We assess the impact of various tax reform proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties in all jurisdictions where we have operations to determine the potential effect on our business and any assumptions we have made about our future taxable income. We cannot predict whether any specific proposals will be enacted, the terms of any such proposals or what effect, if any, such proposals would have on our business if they were to be enacted. Beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the currently available option to deduct research and development expenditures and requires taxpayers to amortize them over five years. The U.S. Congress is considering legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to future periods, however, we have no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified
Management of the Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of net operating loss carryforwards research and development tax credit carryforwards and capitalized expenditures. Under the applicable accounting standards, management has considered the Company’s history of cumulative net losses incurred since inception and its lack of commercialization of any products or generation of any revenue from product sales since inception and concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of its federal and state deferred tax assets.
Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established, and the valuation allowance increased $42.3 million and $22.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Utilization of the net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. The Company has not completed a study to assess whether a change of ownership has occurred, or
 
whether there have been multiple ownership changes since its formation, due to the significant cost and complexity associated with a study. There could also be additional ownership changes in the future which may result in additional limitations on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits.
The Company files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal and state jurisdictions, where applicable. There are currently no pending tax examinations. Since the Company is in a loss carryforward position, it is generally subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state, and local income tax authorities for all tax years in which a loss carryforward is available.
The Company’s policy is to record estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The Company has no amounts recorded for any unrecognized tax positions, accrued interest or penalties as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.

 10. Revenue

In December 2019, the Company entered into a research collaboration agreement with Janssen’s World Without Disease Accelerator (“Janssen”), part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, to explore the potential for a MMT to prevent the onset of childhood allergy and other atopic, immune and metabolic conditions.
The collaboration includes three milestones of research and development with results of those efforts due to Janssen at end of the milestone at which point Janssen will have 60 days to decide to proceed with the next milestone.
The Company assessed the Janssen collaboration agreement in accordance with ASC 808 and ASC 606 and concluded that the arrangement represents a contract with a customer and is within the scope of ASC 606. The promised goods and services represent one combined performance obligation and the entire transaction price will be allocated to that single combined performance obligation. In addition, the Company concluded the right to proceed with the following milestones does not provide any discounts to Janssen if it decides to proceed with the next milestones. As such, the Company concluded the milestone is not considered to be a material right. Each milestone is considered a separate contract and reflects applicable standalone selling prices.
Under the Janssen collaboration agreement, Janssen is obligated to reimburse the Company for the costs incurred under an agreed upon research plan. Costs incurred are billed by the Company to Janssen at completion of each milestone. The Company recognizes revenue over the research period and as the performance obligation is satisfied. using total estimated hours to be incurred throughout each milestone. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized $1.1 million as collaboration revenue under the agreement. Further, as of December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $828 as deferred revenue within other current liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets related to the Janssen collaboration agreement. The expected research term of this arrangement is expected to be completed in the second half of 2022, and the aggregate consideration is not expected to be material.
