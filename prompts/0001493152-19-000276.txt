ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

Overview
 
We are a diversified holding company in the industrial hemp market. Based upon our knowledge and expertise in the regulation of the cannabis industry, we are refocusing our business plan to create a sustainable business model to grow crops and manufacture products from hemp farmland and to market, sell and distribute hemp derivative products such as cannabidiol (“CBD”) distillate and isolate, while exploring other business opportunities that complements our core business. At this time, we cultivate industrial hemp and then through a toll processing and extraction process we sell the hemp derivative product such as CBD IMA on a wholesale basis. We plan to cultivate industrial hemp based on our 320-acre farm in Pueblo, Colorado, through our wholly owned subsidiary, EWSD I, LLC. In 2017, we completed a pilot study on the Pueblo farm where we planted 15 acres of land, which was processed by a third- party contractor and distributed through our network. Based on the pilot study, we planted and harvested an aggregate of 100 acres of land in the planting season (early June to the end of September) of 2018.
 
Through our subsidiary, NY – SHI, LLC, we conducted a similar pilot study on 1.5 acres in the Hudson Valley region of New York State in 2018 through a contractor to determine if it is viable to cultivate industrial hemp in New York on a larger scale. We have received good education on our pilot study and are considering scaling in 2019. In addition to hemp cultivation, we also plan to establish our own pre-processing plant through a joint venture agreement with one of the leading hemp processors in the nation. The plant will not only have the capacity to process our own hemp but also service other hemp farmers. Leveraging our industry experience and existing logistics, we also plan to contract other farmers to grow hemp for us at pre-determined prices so be processed and distributed by us.
 
In February 2018, we, through a newly formed subsidiary, SOCO Processing, LLC, entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding with Mile High Labs LLC and Rush Ventures LLC to build a pre-processing hemp extraction line on our farm in Pueblo, which we plan to license to Rush Ventures LLC for a monthly fee. The plant will not only have the capacity to process hemp grown by EWSD I, LLC, but allow us to generate revenues by referring customers to utilize the pre-processing hemp extraction line at an agreed upon rate. We may also generate revenues by referring customers to utilize the pre-processing hemp extraction line at an agreed upon rate. We are in negotiation for a definitive agreement as of the date of this report.
 
State and local laws regarding farming and growing hemp and processing centers for hemp vary. In June, 2018, the Senate passed the Farm Bill which contains provisions to legalize the cultivation, processing and sale of industrial hemp. With an eye focused on the future and ultimately anticipated FDA approval of hemp and CBD production and sales in the United States, we are honing our focus to controlling our supply chain. From “seed to sale,” we will control our own destiny by controlling our ecosystem. We intend to oversee and execute everything from growing and cultivating the highest quality plants to managing extraction and production of our products.
 
Leveraging our industry experience and existing logistics, we also plan to contract other farmers to grow hemp at pre-determined prices to be processed and distributed by us
 
Historically, we established joint ventures and entered into operating and management agreements with our partners and acted as a distributor of hemp products processed by our contractors. We also generated revenue from various sources on a “one-time basis” for services that we provided to clients in helping them obtain licenses, build out and open dispensaries and cultivation centers. We also sold a line of portable vaporizers and accessories under the brand name Vaporfection. We have discontinued these business operations to focus on our current business model, which we believe will generate consistent and predictable revenues.

Corporate History
 
We were originally incorporated on June 16, 1977 in the State of Nevada under the name “Rabatco, Inc.” In May 2000, we changed our name to MindfulEye, Inc. On November 25, 2011, P. Vincent Mehdizadeh purchased 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. On August 30, 2011, in anticipation of the transaction discussed below, we changed our name to “Medbox, Inc.” Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement with PVM International, Inc. dated December 31, 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock in various entities controlled by Mr. Mehdizadeh, in exchange for 2,000,000 shares of our common stock and a $1 million promissory note. The promissory note was repaid in full on April 16, 2013. In August 2012, Mr. Mehdizadeh purchased the remainder of our outstanding shares in a private transaction. During December of 2016 the Company’s Board of Directors and management completed a strategic shift and completely exited the vapor and medical cannabis dispensing line. (See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.)
 
Effective January 28, 2016, we changed our name from Medbox, Inc., to Notis Global, Inc.
 
Government Regulations
 
The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the “Farm Bill”) was signed into law in December 2018, which legalizes hemp cultivation broadly and the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines. Pursuant to the Farm Bill, hemp may not contain more than 0.3 percent tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Any cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3 percent THC would be considered non-hemp cannabis under federal law with no legal protection. In addition, state departments of agriculture must consult with the state’s governor and chief law enforcement officer to devise a plan that must be submitted to the Secretary of USDA. A state’s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once the Secretary of USDA approves that state’s plan. In states opting not to devise a hemp regulatory program, USDA will construct a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states must apply for licenses and comply with a federally-run program. The Farm Bill also outlines actions that are considered violations of federal hemp law (including such activities as cultivating without a license or producing cannabis with more than 0.3 percent THC). The law details possible punishments for such violations, pathways for violators to become compliant, and even which activities qualify as felonies under the law, such as repeated offenses.

On August 11, 2016, a Statement of Principles on Industrial Hemp (the “Statement”) was issued by the Office of Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) of the Department of Health and Human Service (“HHS”). On this date, Jonathan Miller, Esq., Frost, Brown Tod, Lexington, KY., and Co-signed by Joseph Sandler, Esq. , Sandler Reiff Lamb Rosenstein & Berkenstock, Washington, DC., provided to the Members of the Kentucky Hemp Industry Counsel, a legal Opinion on the U.S. Federal Agency Statement of Principles. This legal opinion provided:
 
As we outlined comprehensively in our Opinion on the Legal Status of Industrial Hemp, dated December 21, 2015 and attached as Appendix B (“our December Opinion”), the Agricultural Act of 2014, P.L. No. 113-79 (the “2014 Farm Bill”) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY 2016 (the “Omnibus Law”) constitute a sweeping legal revolution for the industrial hemp crop. Taken together, the two laws ensure that individuals and firms that are engaged in authorized agricultural pilot programs should be permitted to grow, cultivate, transport, process, sell and/or use industrial hemp under the guidelines and regulations of state law, without interference from agencies using federally-authorized funds.
 
The issuance of the Statement of Principles by the three federal agencies most involved in these issues – the USDA, the DEA and FDA – brings that valued sense of certainty to individuals and firms involved in the industrial hemp business. Further, clarity provided by the Statement brings several items of good news to hemp farmers and firms:
 

[ ] | While initially, the DEA rejected a clear understanding of the 2014 Farm Bill that institutions of higher education and state departments of agriculture could contract out hemp pilot projects to private farmers and business – requiring us to go to federal court to clarify – the Statement clearly acknowledges that private “persons licensed, registered, or otherwise authorized” by state agriculture departments and “persons employed by or under a production contract or lease” with colleges and universities may participate in pilot programs. 
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] | Moreover, in the most welcome portion of the Statement, authorized pilot program participants “may be able to participate in USDA research or other programs to the extent otherwise eligible for participation in those programs.” We believe that this broad language for the first time opens up duly registered pilot projects to be eligible for loans, grants, certification programs, and the wide variety of other opportunities made available to farmers and agri-businesses at USDA and its sub-agencies. 
[ ] | These federal agencies also for the first time acknowledge that, as part of marketing research programs, “industrial hemp products can be sold” in or among states with pilot programs. This recognition, which reflects clear authorization by the 2014 Farm Bill and the Omnibus Law, will not only give hemp farmers and businesses confidence that they can sell their products; but perhaps more importantly, provides much needed assurance to financial institutions that such commerce is legal, and that they can facilitate financial transactions in the industry. 
[ ] | The Statement makes clear that the FDA will continue to oversee “marketing claims” and the “process for drug applications,” while the Controlled Substances Act will still apply to “the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of drug products.” Accordingly, the advice we shared in our December Opinion is confirmed: Firms engaged in producing hemp products for human consumption should not market their products as a “drug” nor make any medicinal claims without prior FDA approval. However, there are no blanket prohibitions on any other kind of sale of hemp-based consumable products such as cannabidiol (“CBD”), nor even any mention of CBD in the Statement. 

 
In addition, our subsidiaries, including but not limited to EWSD I, LLC, are also subject to other federal and local regulations, including the Pesticide Act of the State of Colorado.

Competition
 
Our competitors in both the hemp space include sellers of products and services dedicated to the hemp and compliance regulated cannabis industry, including the cultivation, processing and distribution of industrial hemp products. We compete in markets where cannabis has been legalized and regulated, which includes various states within the United States. We expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the industry matures. Additionally, increased competition is possible to the extent that new states and geographies enter the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes that de-criminalize and regulate cannabis products. We believe that by diligently establishing and expanding our brands, product offerings and services in new and existing locations, we will become well established in this growing industry. Additionally, we expect that establishing our product offerings in new and existing locations are factors that mitigate the risk associated with operating in a developing competitive environment. Additionally, the contemporaneous growth of the industry as a whole will result in new customers entering the marketplace, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our operations and results. Our competitors may have substantially greater resources, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals, operating experience, marketing capabilities, name recognition and production capabilities.
Employees
 
As of November 19, 2018, we have no full time employees and one of our subsidiaries, EWSD I, LLC, has ten (10) full time employees. The number of our, and our subsidiaries, part time employees fluctuates over the course of one year due to the nature of our business. We also use the services of five (5) independent contractors, of whom two (2) are through EWSD I, LLC. Neither we nor our subsidiaries have experienced any work stoppages and we consider the relations with their respective employees and independent contractors to be good.
Implications of Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of relief from certain reporting requirements and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

● | reduced obligations with respect to financial data, including presenting only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of selected financial data in this prospectus; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | an exception from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
● | reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and 
● | exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. 

 
We may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years or such earlier time that we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, have more than $700 million in market value of our capital stock held by non-affiliates or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced reporting burdens. For example, we intend to take advantage of the reduced reporting requirements with respect to disclosure regarding our executive compensation arrangements, have presented only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure in this prospectus, and have taken advantage of the exemption from auditor attestation on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. To the extent that we take advantage of these reduced reporting burdens, the information that we provide stockholders may be different than you might obtain from other public companies in which you hold equity interests.

In addition, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
