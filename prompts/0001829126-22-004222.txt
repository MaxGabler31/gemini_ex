Description of Business 
 
Moveix Inc.(“the Company”, “we” “us’) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 5, 2016.
 
The Company was organized to buy the electric transportation products wholesale from Chinese manufacturers and sell these products via our website. The Company intended to concentrate its first year of operation in Europe, expanding our second year of operation to the North American market. Our main selling product will be the hoverboard. The two-wheeled self-balancing electric scooter is commonly referred to as a hoverboard, which is a type of portable, rechargeable battery-powered scooter. They typically consist of two wheels arranged side-by-side, with two small platforms between the wheels, on which the rider stands. The device is controlled by the rider’s feet, standing on the built-in gyroscopic and sensor pads. There is no universally accepted name for the device, as its various product names are attributable to the companies which distribute it and not its manufacturers. Also, the Company intended to resell electric bikes and Segways.
 
The Company’s fiscal year-end is May 31.
 
The Company has been dormant since April 15, 2019.

Competition and Market Conditions
 
We will face substantial competition in our efforts to identify and pursue a business venture. The primary source of competition is expected to be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, including small venture capital firms, blank check companies, and wealthy investors, many of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In light of our limited financial and human resources, we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many of our competitors in our efforts to obtain an operating business or assets necessary to commence our operations in a new field. Additionally, with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, many venture capital firms and similar firms and individuals have been seeking to acquire businesses at discounted rates, and we therefore currently face additional competition and resultant difficulty obtaining a business. We expect these conditions to persist at least until the economy recovers. Further, even if we are successful in obtaining a business or assets for new operations, we expect there to be enhanced barriers to entry in the marketplace in which we decide to operate as a result of reduced demand and/or increased raw material costs caused by the pandemic and other economic forces that are beyond our control.
