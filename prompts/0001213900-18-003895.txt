ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are principally engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products for human use in connection with a variety of high-incidence and high-mortality diseases and medical conditions prevalent in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”). All of our operations are conducted in the PRC, where our manufacturing facilities are located. We manufacture pharmaceutical products in the form of dry powder injectables, liquid injectables, tablets, capsules, and cephalosporin oral solutions. The majority of our pharmaceutical products are sold on a prescription basis and all have been approved for at least one or more therapeutic indications by the China Food and Drug Administration (the “CFDA”) based upon demonstrated safety and efficacy.
 
As of December 31, 2017, we manufactured 19 pharmaceutical products for a wide variety of diseases and medical indications, each of which may be classified into one of three general categories:
 

● | Basic generic drugs, which are common drugs in the PRC for which there is a very large market demand; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | First-to-market generic drugs, which are generic Western drugs that are new to the PRC marketplace; or 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Modern Traditional Chinese Medicines, which are generally comprised of non-synthetic, plant-based medicinal compounds of the type that have been widely used in the PRC for thousands of years, to which we apply modern production techniques to produce pharmaceutical products in different formulations, such as tablets, capsules or powders. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In selecting generic drugs to develop and manufacture, we consider several factors, including the number of other manufacturers currently producing a particular drug, the size of the market for that drug, the proposed or required method of distribution, the existing and expected pricing for that particular drug in the marketplace, the costs of manufacturing that drug, and the costs of acquiring or developing the formula for that drug. We believe we have historically selected generic drugs for manufacture that have large addressable markets and higher profit margins relative to other generic drugs manufactured and distributed in the PRC.

We currently own and operate an approximately 8,000-square-meter manufacturing facility in Haikou, Hainan Province, built in 2002, that supports eight modern, scalable production lines. We implement quality control procedures in this facility in compliance with the PRC’s Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP standards, and applicable CFDA regulations to ensure consistent quality in our products.
 
The CFDA promulgated Good Manufacturing Practices for Pharmaceutical Products (2010 revised version) (the “new GMP”) on February 12, 2011 (effective as of March 1, 2011). The new GMP standards outline the basic principles and standards for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products and the management of quality controls in the pharmaceutical products manufacturing industry in the PRC. Pursuant to those mandatory requirements, upgrades to our two injectables production lines were required to be finalized by the end of 2013. From January 1, 2014 to November 3, 2014, we suspended production at our dry powder injectables and liquid injectables production lines due to a failure to meet the new GMP upgrade deadline. However, in 2014, we completed construction of a new 20,000 square-meter factory equipped with four sterilize production lines (two liquid injectables and two dry powder injectables production lines), in full compliance with the latest GMP standard. In November 2014, the CFDA completed GMP certification of our new facility and issued us with a GMP certificate, enabling us to commence manufacturing at our two liquid injectables and two dry powder injectables production lines. In January and December 2015, we completed further upgrades and received new GMP certificates for the tablet and capsule production lines and the cephalosporin production lines in our old factories.
 
We market and sell our products through 16 sales offices covering all major cities and provinces in the PRC. To comply with applicable Chinese law relating to sales of prescription drugs to certain hospitals and clinics, we also use a distribution system comprised of over 1,000 independent prefecture-level, city-level, and county-level distributors. Our sales system has further developed and expanded with the expansion of Chinese healthcare reform, and our 16 provincial offices deliver our products to basic health care institutions as well as tier two and tier three hospitals through the above mentioned distributors.

Corporate History


We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our production, marketing, finance, development and administrative activities through our wholly-owned subsidiary located in the PRC. We were incorporated in the State of Delaware under the name “Softstone, Inc.” on January 28, 1999. From mid-2003 to October 19, 2005, we did not generate any significant revenue and we accumulated no significant assets while we explored business opportunities as a publicly-held “shell” corporation.
 
We entered into our current line of business on October 19, 2005, through the acquisition of Onny Investment Limited, a holding company formed in the British Virgin Islands (“Onny”), and its operating subsidiary located in the PRC, Hainan Helpson Medical & Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (“Helpson”). On March 16, 2006, we changed our corporate name to China Pharma Holdings, Inc. On December 31, 2012, we reincorporated from the State of Delaware to the State of Nevada.
 
Helpson was established on February 25, 1993, in Haikou, Hainan Province, PRC as a foreign-invested enterprise. The company was originally an “equity joint venture,” as defined by China’s laws on foreign invested enterprises, between Haikou Biomedical Engineering Co., Ltd., a PRC company, and Hong Kong Fudao Development Co., Ltd., a Hong Kong company (“Fudao”).
 
On June 16, 2001, Fudao entered into an Equity Interest Transfer Agreement with Hainan Kaidi Science and Technology Co., Ltd., a PRC company (“Kaidi”), pursuant to which Fudao transferred all of its ownership interest in Helpson to Kaidi. As a result of this transfer, Helpson became a PRC domestic company, rather than a foreign-invested company.
 
Onny was incorporated on January 12, 2005, under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. On May 25, 2005, Helpson’s three then-existing shareholders entered into an equity interest transfer agreement with Onny, as a result of which, effective as of June 21, 2005, Helpson became a wholly foreign-owned enterprise (“WFOE”), and Onny became the sole shareholder of Helpson.
 
On October 19, 2005, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Onny in exchange for 27,499,940 shares of our common stock and became Onny’s sole shareholder. In connection with this share exchange, all of our officers and directors at that time resigned from their positions as officers and directors of our Company, and new directors and executive officers were appointed. Also as a result of this share exchange, commonly referred to as a “reverse acquisition,” Helpson became our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary.

Our corporate organizational chart is set forth below.



Industry Background and Market Opportunities
 
According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry’s revenue and profit growth increased by more than 25% from 2009 to 2011, but began to decline year by year; and reached its lowest point in 2015. In 2016, it slightly recovered due to sustained growth at around 10% and 14%, respectively. From January to November 2017, the pharmaceutical industry recorded income of RMB2.59 trillion (approximately USD0.40 trillion), or an increase of 12.3% compared to the same period in 2016, showing a more favorable trend. In general, the pharmaceutical industry was no longer in the rapid growth phase, but rather a relatively slower and internally differentiated growth phase.
 
From the perspective of industrial policy, the pharmaceutical industry has gone through two stages in the recent decade: (1) a golden period, as the industry developed rapidly before 2011 along with the expansion of China’s medical insurance system; and (2) a period of decline, in which the growth rate has visibly deteriorated since 2012, partly due to the new rural cooperative medical system and urban residents’ medical insurance system roughly reaching full coverage, thus, causing the growth rate of funding of China’s medical insurance system to decline, and pricing pressure to be put into the spotlight.

Various reform policies have been promulgated and enforced since 2016. With the advancement of public hospital reforms and progression of the drug regulatory system, the diversity among manufacturers has further intensified. The key takeaways from 2017 include the implementation of policy: a drug bidding process was approved in various provinces, the two-invoice system was fully launched, the new medical insurance catalog was launched, the drug supervision system was further promoted, and implementation explanations around consistency evaluation were issued. It is likely that the environment of the pharmaceutical industry will be refined, and the development of the industry will enter a new era.
 
Although it has been difficult for the chemical drug industry to maintain the same high growth rate it experienced before 2012 due to the completion of the expansion of health insurance, with the positive impacts of its policies gradual declines, as well as the existence of Medicare cost-controls and drug pricing pressures resulting from drug bidding. However, in the context of China’s aging population, the consumption of pharmaceuticals is expected to increase, and although the growth rate of health insurance expenditures will not remain at the previous high level, the industry will still be able to maintain growth. In addition, personal expenditures and fiscal expenditures in healthcare are expected to continue to increase. Therefore, we believe that demand for pharmaceuticals and consumer ability to pay is still enjoying steady growth. Although the growth rate has been declined, our industry is now very large-scale. 
 
Consistency Evaluation


The development of generic drugs is an important measure to reduce medical expenses. By conducting generic drug consistency evaluation, generic drugs can be advertised as consistent with the original drug in terms of efficacy and quality, and may even replace the original drug in clinical practice. This work can greatly enhance the overall development of China’s pharmaceutical industry, and it also provides support for the quality of generic drugs.


On March 5, 2016, the Chinese State Council issued “Opinions on Carrying out Consistency Evaluations of the Quality and Efficacy of Generic Drugs” (the “Opinions”). Over 95% of the currently-sold drugs in China are generics which are subject to the “Opinions”. Per the “Opinions”, any solid oral solution generics listed in the National Essential Drugs List (2012 edition) that received production approval before October 1, 2007, shall complete a Consistency Evaluation by the end of 2018,while an applicant which needs to carry out clinical trials and has certain special circumstances shall complete a Consistency Evaluation by the end of 2021. Overdue applicants may no longer be eligible for re-registration. According to CFDA statistics, a total of 289 formulas, 17740 production approval numbers, 1817 domestic pharmaceutical manufacturers, and 42 overseas manufacturers will be affected by the Opinions. Unfortunately, annual sales of most of those 17740 production approval numbers did not exceed RMB5 million. In which case, manufacturers make wait and extended period of time to recoup the capital investment for consistency evaluation. The similarities in the pharmaceutical market in China lead to low profit rate. The money invested in consistency evaluation comes from the manufacturer; therefore in general, manufacturers prefer to take consistency evaluation of selected existing products with higher profitability.

Oral Solid Formulation Conformance Assessment 289 catalog has more than 18,000 drug approvals. The annual sales of most varieties do not exceed 5 million. It takes an extended period of time for companies to recoup the cost of consistency assessment.
 
In order to promote consistency evaluation, the P.R.C. State Council and its related agencies have issued corresponding policies. The result is two core points: first, the medicines that pass the consistency evaluation are given appropriate support in the payment of medical insurance; and should be given priority during drug purchase and prescription; the second applies when more than 3 manufacturers have passed the consistency evaluation for a certain drug, then other manufacturers will no longer be eligible to participate in centralized purchase for this drug.


Consistency evaluation is a reshuffle of the generic pharmaceutical industry. Generic drugs whose quality levels are not up to standard will be withdrawn from the market. The revision of the national drug standards can be seen as a continuation of this policy and will intensify the shuffling of the pharmaceutical industry. According to data from China National Health Information Corporation, in 2016, the total scale of China’s pharmaceutical end-use market (without medicinal materials) amounted to RMB1.49 trillion (approximately USD 0.23 trillion). It is said that the consistency assessment and the revision of the national drug standards will involve the reshuffle of the RMB1 trillion (approximately USD 0.15 trillion) market.


Bioequivalence testing (BE Testing) is an important component of Consistency Evaluations. Unfortunately, there are a limited number of institutions that currently carry out BE Testing, which has become for a significant brake on the progress of the Consistency Evaluation program. The PRC had more than 400 clinical drug trial institutions back in 2016, while, per the “Notice on the Clinical Trial Practice by Clinical Trial Institutions and Contract Research organizations” issued by CFDA on September 9, 2015, there were only 82 clinical drug trial institutions that had undertaken BE Testing and Phase I clinical trial. Fortunately, the government has aggressively addressed this problem in recent years. CFDA issued the “Certification of Pharmaceutical Clinical Trial Qualifications (No. 9) (No. 165 of 2017)” on December 28, 2017. Together with the 618 clinical drug trial institutions previously released, so far the number of clinical drug trial institutions has reached 625.

BE Testing costs are considered a major share in the overall costs of Consistency Evaluations, which in turn will increase capital expenditures for our industry. In addition, if a generic drug under evaluation cannot achieve the same consistency of quality and efficacy as the originally-developed drug, the generic manufacturer must re-develop and optimize its existing formula and production process through further analysis of the quality standards and physical and chemical characteristics of the originally-developed drug, including a study of the crystal form and solubility.


The Center For Drug Evaluation released the “Technical Requirement for the Consistency Evaluation of Marketed Chemicals (Injectables) (Draft for Comment)” on December 22, 2017, which launched a prelude to the consistency evaluation of injections.


The PRC’s medical insurance system


The PRC started putting basic medical insurance in place for urban workers in 1998, kicked off the “New Rural Cooperative Program” (new rural cooperative medical care program) in 2003, and implemented basic medical insurance for urban residents in 2007 to cover unemployed and low-income urban residents. After 20 years of hard work, basic medical insurance has almost covered the entire population. The universal health insurance, consists mainly of basic medical insurance for employees, basic medical insurance for urban residents, and new rural cooperative medical care. By the end of 2016, there were more than 1.3 billion people participating in the basic medical insurance system in China, and the coverage rate of the insurance coverage was more than 95%. In 2016, the state officially initiated the integration of the two systems of urban residents’ basic medical insurance and new rural cooperative medical care. From January to November 2017, the number of urban basic medical insurance participants was RMB1.15 billion (approximately USD0.18 billion), an increase of 63.7% year-on-year, and the amount of funds raised was RMB1.58 trillion (approximately USD0.24 billion), an increase of 40.6% year-on-year, and expenditure was RMB1.23 trillion (approximately USD0.19 billion), an increase of 35.7% year-on-year. The increase in the number of insured persons, the growth of fundraising and the acceleration of expenditures were mainly due to the accelerated progress of the integration of the two programs.

The reimbursement rates for outpatient and inpatient expenses for new rural cooperative medical care remained stable at around 50% and 70%, respectively in 2017, The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Sciences issued the 2017 edition of Medical Insurance Drug List (MIDL 2017) on February 23, 2017. The MIDL 2017 included 2,535 drugs, which represented an increase of 339 drugs, or 15.4% compared to 2009 edition; among which included 1297 western drugs, which represented an increase of 133 drugs, or 11.4%; and 1238 traditional Chinese medicine, which represented an increase of 251 or 25.4%. The MIDL 2017 reflected the government’s policy on “filling vacancies, selecting the best, supporting innovation, encouraging competition”; and gave special consideration and support for children’s medicines, innovative medicines, major disease treatment medicines and ethnic medicines.
 
The direction of reform of China’s medical insurance payment method has been established. As such, the total amount of medical insurance expenditures is controlled through the mixed payment methods such as total advance payment and disease-based payment; at the same time, the drugs with clinically urgent need and high degree of innovation are included in the scope of reimbursement through price negotiation. The drugs that solve the medical problems of part of the patients with major diseases help reduce or even eliminate the proportion of reimbursement for supplemental medicines; thus, allowing the remaining medical insurance funds to be used for innovative drugs and high-quality generic drugs with therapeutic effects.
 
At the end of 2017, medical insurance payment reforms were accelerated throughout the country, and multiple compound medical insurance payment methods based on disease-based payment were gradually introduced. According to a rough estimate, nearly two-thirds of the country’s provinces have implemented or are piloting the implementation of a disease-based charge.


There are other factors that may also affect the pharmaceutical industry, such as Medicare cost-controls. In order to control the rapid increase in medical expenditures, the government of the PRC has, since 2010, introduced a series of policies to strengthen supervision and control effects of Medicare on healthcare services, to reform the Medicare payment methods, to establish a hierarchical treatment system, to eliminate pharmaceutical mark-ups, and to reduce the proportion of drug costs to total healthcare costs, etc. In June 2016, the PRC’s National Health Commission called on each province to determine the growth rate of medical expenditures as soon as possible and further proposed limiting the national medical expenditure growth rate to no higher than 10% by the end of 2017. The General Office of the State Council issued the “Guiding Opinions on Further Deepening the Reform of Basic Medical Insurance Payment Methods.” on June 28, 2017. The goal is to further strengthen the budget management of the Medicare fund from 2017 onwards, and fully implement multiple compound medical insurance payment methods based on disease-based payment. We believe that Medicare cost-controls have been a consistent theme of our industry. These cost-controls have been a serious challenge for medical institutions, manufacturing companies, and drug-logistic companies.

The CFDA promulgated Good Manufacturing Practices for Pharmaceutical Products (2010 revised version) (the “new GMP”) on February 12, 2011 (effective as of March 1, 2011). The new GMP standards outline basic principles and standards for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products and the management of quality controls in pharmaceutical manufacturing processes in the PRC. Since they were first adopted in 1988, GMP have over two decades of history in China, and were revised in 1992 and 1998. As of June 30, 2004, all manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”) and finished dosages must be in compliance with the GMP standards. The new GMP standards that became effective on March 1, 2011, include improvements based upon foreign manufacturing advancements, and have taken into consideration local conditions in China. Based on the principle of “equal importance between hardware and software”, strictly implementing the idea of risk control during the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, and increased focus on scientific guidance and operability, the new GMP standards are consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) standards.
 
The four main prongs of the new GMP standards are: (1) strengthening quality control systems during the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products by significantly increasing requirements regarding quality control software; (2) improving requirements regarding the quality of practitioners; (3) refining operational procedures, rules on document management (including manufacturing records), improving guidance and operability; and (4) further improvements related to measures to ensure the safety of pharmaceutical products.


The Drug Marketing Authorization Holder (“MAH”) model is a management model that separates marketing authorization from independent production licensing. License holders may delegate production to manufacturers and are only responsible for the safety, effectiveness and quality control of drugs manufactured for public consumption. The MAH model is a common worldwide practice for review and approval of new drugs, and h encourages investment in research and development and the adoption of Contract Manufacturing Organization.

In August 2015, the PRC State Council issued “Opinions on the Reform of Drug and Medical Devices Evaluation and Approval of System Review”, which proposed to implement the MAH system experiments. Because the Company is considered a manufacturer pursuant to this policy, we believe this policy will benefit our Company in the long run, given our new GMP certified production facility and because we have the potential to manufacture products for license holders in the future.
 
Our Strategy


We believe we are well positioned in a comparatively steadily growing industry in one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. We currently manufacture a number of off-patent branded generic drugs that were among the first to market in the PRC. We expect to continue to gain additional competitive advantages through the growing pipeline of new pharmaceutical products we are developing for specific target patient groups. Our diverse portfolio of products and our new product pipelines include products for high-incidence and high-mortality conditions in the PRC, such as cardiovascular, central nervous system (“CNS”), infectious, and digestive diseases. Furthermore, the Healthcare Reform initiated by the State Council in 2008 in the PRC has significantly expanded the landscape of the Chinese healthcare industry. According to the 2017 National Economic and Social Development Statistics Bulletin of the People’s Republic of China issued by National Bureau of Statistics of the PRC, the total number of Chinese healthcare institutions has reached 995,000 as of the end of 2017, including 30,000 hospitals, 940,000 grass-root healthcare institutes (comprised of 37,000 township healthcare centers, 35,000 community health service centers (stations), 230,000 clinics, 638,000 village healthcare centers), and 22,000 professional public health institutions. We believe the increase in demand from these sources should allow us to grow organically. In addition, the total number of medical personnel in the PRC has reached 8.91 million, including 3.35 million practicing physicians and practicing assistant physicians and 3.79 million registered nurses. The number of beds in medical and health institutions has reached 7.85 million, including 6.09 million in hospitals and 1.25 million in township healthcare centers.
 
Production approval from the CFDA for Candesartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist serving as a first-line treatment for hypertension, developed in November 2013 and launched towards the end of 2014, and for new products from our pipeline of products under development (such as a generic version of Crestor and novel anti-drug-resistant combination antibiotics), would offer us significant growth opportunities. Finally, healthcare reform has started to change the landscape of the Chinese pharmaceutical industry, which we believe will create many attractive acquisition opportunities. We plan to explore these opportunities in an effort to add synergistic products that can help us grow our business.

Our objective is to leverage our expertise in the PRC for the development, manufacture and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. We intend to achieve this objective by:
 

● | Promoting Our Existing Brands to Increase Our National Recognition. We intend to support and grow the existing recognition and reputation of our brands and to maintain our branded pricing strategy through continued sales and marketing efforts through our new, upgraded GMP-compliant production lines. To achieve this goal, we plan to promote the efficacy and safety profile of our established prescription pharmaceutical products to physicians at hospitals and clinics in all provinces of PRC through the efforts of our sales force, independent distributors and educational physician conferences and seminars. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developing and Introducing Additional Products to Expand or Strengthen Our Existing Product Portfolio. We plan to focus our development capabilities towards expanding our existing portfolio of approved products. We have a number of products in various stages of the CFDA approval process. In addition, we intend to conduct clinical trials for new generic or modernized products to expand our existing product portfolio. We plan to introduce new generic or modernized products to leverage our branded market leadership position, particularly in therapeutic areas in which we already have a strong presence. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanding Our Distribution Network to Increase Market Penetration. We intend to expand our reach beyond our current 16 offices in the PRC to drive additional growth of our existing and future products. We currently contract with over 1,000 distributors in the PRC and plan to expand on these relationships to target new markets. We will continue our conservative sales strategy of increased cooperation with customers with reliable accounts receivable collection performance. In addition, we plan to continue to broaden our marketing efforts outside of major cities in the PRC and to increase our market penetration in cities and rural areas where we already have a presence. Over the long term, we also intend to expand our presence beyond the PRC to international markets by working with international pharmaceutical companies in cross-selling our products. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Acquiring Complementary Products Lines, Technologies, Distribution Networks and Companies. We intend to selectively pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that we believe will grow our customer base, expand our product lines and distribution network, enhance our manufacturing and technical expertise or otherwise complement our business or further our strategic goals. Pursuing strategic acquisitions is a significant component of our growth strategy. The Company has not identified any strategic acquisition opportunities as of the date of this report on Form 10-K.

Due to the nature of the pharmaceutical industry, we continually strive to change our product portfolio to respond to changes in market demand. Based on a foundation established by a number of our widely-recognized prescription products, such as Cefaclor and Roxithromycin, we have launched and will continue to launch a variety of pharmaceuticals. The core criteria for our selection of potential pipeline products are strong market demand, proven efficacy, and safety. In an effort to gain an advantage in the marketplace, we often seek to improve the production process of the new generic products we elect to manufacture or to improve the quality of a proposed product to increase its efficacy.


We also adjust the delivery systems and marketing for each of our products based on the product’s target patient group. We believe that maintaining a variety of delivery systems (e.g. tablet, capsules, injectables and dry powders) for certain of our products targeted at different groups enhances our competitive position in the marketplace. As a result, our sales and marketing personnel work closely with management and our research and development personnel to determine which of our products can successfully be marketed for more than one delivery system and which generic drugs in the marketplace may be good candidates for us to manufacture and distribute using different delivery systems.

Product Development


Our product portfolio includes both branded and generic drugs that we either develop independently, in joint research efforts with our academic institutional partners, or, to a lesser extent, acquire from third parties. We develop new products in-house as well as in cooperation with several research institutes, including the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China University of Pharmaceuticals, Sichuan University, Chongqing Medical Industry Institute and the Military Medical Academy Basic Medical Science Institute. We only pay these institutes for their research efforts and expenses if our research goals are accomplished as evidenced by the certification of an applicable drug candidate and the approval of drug production by the CFDA. Following receipt of such certification and approval, the rights to the applicable drug candidate are transferred to us. Upon any such payment and transfer, we become the sole owner of the drug certifications and/or the approvals of drug production and any related research, and we have no further payment or other obligations to the research institute from which we acquired such assets. We obtained certificates and approvals of drug production for our Naproxen Sodium and Pseudophedrine Hydroclorida sustained-release tablets through our cooperative relationship with the Chongqing Medical Industry Institute, and we also obtained certificates and approvals of drug production for our Cefalcor dispersible tablets through our cooperative relationship with the China University of Pharmaceuticals. We are now manufacturing and selling both drugs. We expect to continue to develop additional new drugs using this method. We also intend to continue purchasing or obtaining licenses from third parties to produce certain drug products on a limited basis, as we regard this as an important and effective means for us to develop our business. New products in our pipeline have experienced delays because the CFDA enhanced its approval criteria and processes, resulting in additional supplemental materials and trials, higher cost, and longer approval time for certain applications across all pharmaceutical products, including all of our product types. We commenced leading formulation screening, a new technology exploration and technical criteria improvement activity, in 2013. We expect this new model to accelerate our development timelines and expand exploration channels for our pipeline products.


Generic drugs are drugs with the same active ingredient, dosage form, delivery channel and therapeutic effects as the originally-developed drug. The Consistency Evaluations require currently marketed generic products to prove consistency in terms of quality and therapeutic effect, and the ability to act as a substitute for the original drug during clinical trials. The Consistency Evaluations could enhance the development of the pharmaceutical industry, ensure drug safety and effectiveness, promote the improvement and restructuring of the pharmaceutical industry, and increase international competitiveness.
 
The PRC State Council issued the “Opinions on Carrying out Consistency Evaluation on Quality and Efficacy of Generic Drugs” on March 5, 2016, requiring all manufacturers of generic chemical pipeline products to carry out Consistency Evaluations before they may obtain final registration approval. In addition, all oral solution generic drugs listed in National Essential Drugs List (2012 edition) and launched into the market before October 1, 2007, must undergo Consistency Evaluations by the end of 2018, and Consistency Evaluation should be completed by the end of 2021 for drugs with existing special conditions or those which require clinical efficacy trials. Drugs failing to meet these requirements may not be re-registered.

Currently, due to this newly issued policy, as with all other Chinese generic pharmaceutical companies, the CFDA production approved standards and experimental requirements for almost all of our pipeline products have undergone major adjustments. Management decided to terminate the development and research of some of the product formulations after it had fully evaluated the technical difficulties, investment expectations, and expected future market returns of product formulations under the new standard.
 
Due to the complex implementation rules of Consistency Evaluations that are still being introduced, we suspended the development of our pipeline products in 2016. The following list sets forth the current status of our main pipeline products:



Indication of Product Candidate | CFDA Status 
------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anti-infection | In Phase II Clinical Study, Supplement Clinical Study Due to Improved Technology Criteria 
Cholesterol Control Drug | we have submitted an application for production approval, and are supplementing Consistency Evaluation experiments per the New Policy 
Alzheimer’s Disease drug | At the latest stage of supplementing Consistency Evaluation per the New Policy 
Coronary Heart Disease Drug | Phase III Clinical Study Completed, and are supplementing clinical trials pursuant to the updated criteria 

 
We have several other pipeline products in various stages of development.


Distribution and Customers


We believe we have a well-established sales network. As our current pharmaceutical product portfolio is comprised mainly prescription drugs, our major sales targets are hospitals. As of December 31, 2017, we also had 16 sales offices covering all major provinces of China, and over 1,000 sales representatives who assist in managing many of our relationships with hospitals, doctors and local drug distributors. Overall, our distribution model is rather flat, with relatively few intermediaries compared to many other pharmaceutical companies in China. Due to this advantage, we believe we are able to keep our selling cost lower than the industry average.


17

 

Due to the nature of our products and current governmental regulations, all of our customers are located in the PRC. We have established long-standing relationships with most of our key customers as our operating subsidiary, Helpson, formed in 1993.
 
Production Facilities


We manufacture and package our products at our manufacturing facility in the Haikou Free Trade Zone in Haikou, Hainan Province. Our old manufacturing facility, which was built in 2002, is approximately 8,000 square meters; and our new building, approximately 20,000 square meters, was completed in 2013. We have production lines with new GMP certificates for different forms including: tablets, capsule, dry power, liquid injectables, solid oral solution Cephalosporins (specifically designated).
 
The CFDA promulgated Good Manufacturing Practices for Pharmaceutical Products (2010 revised version) (the “New GMP Standards”) on February 12, 2011, which became effective on March 1, 2011. The new GMP outlines the basic principles and standards for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products and the management of quality controls in the manufacturing process in the PRC. Pursuant to those mandatory requirements, the upgrading of our two sterilization production lines - liquid injectables and dry powder injectables production lines were required to be completed by the end of 2013. As of January 1, 2014, we had suspended two such production lines due to the failure to meet the GMP upgrading deadline. However, construction of our new main building has been completed, and two new sterilization production lines have been installed. In November 2014 the CFDA completed their process of the GMP certification for our new facility and issued the GMP certificate to enable us to commence manufacturing our liquid injectables and dry powder injectable product lines. In January and December 2015, we also completed the upgrading and received new GMP certificates for the tablet and capsule production lines, and cephalosporin production lines in our old factories respectively.
 
18

 

Raw Materials


We require a supply of a wide variety of raw materials to manufacture our products. We employ purchasing staff with extensive knowledge of our products who work with our product development, and formulations and quality control personnel to source raw materials for our products. Currently, we rely on numerous suppliers in the PRC and overseas to deliver our required raw materials and believe we have at least three principal suppliers for each of our most critical raw materials. Historically, we have not had difficulty obtaining raw materials from suppliers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our purchases from four suppliers accounted for 19.8%, 17.1%, 15.4% and 11.8% of raw material purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our purchases from one supplier accounted for approximately 21.1% of raw material purchases.
Competition


We believe we have established a commercially competitive position in the highly-fragmented pharmaceutical industry in China through our core competitive advantages, as described below:
 
We have a highly-efficient commercialization process for new products, including significant experience with the CFDA registration process.
 
We have over 20 years of product-development experience during which time we have implemented processes to efficiently introduce and market new and existing products to the Chinese market. 


We have a market-oriented product portfolio and product lines.
 
Our product focus is on developing and manufacturing medicines that help large patient groups, such as the infectious disease and cardio vascular disease patient groups. Our diversified GMP-certified manufacturing facility includes various production lines targeting a variety of delivery mechanisms, such as tablets, capsules, cephalosprine tablets, cephalosprine capsules, liquid-injectables and dry powder injectables, which enables us to effectively manufacture a broad range of new drugs.
 
19

 

We have product diversification to target specific sub-markets.
 
We attempt to differentiate our products from those of our competitors by changing, and, in many cases, improving certain physical aspects of our products to address to different market segments. For example, to make our Cefaclor product more patient friendly to children and patients with swallowing problems, we added an enteric coating to make our tablets easier to swallow.


We have a national sales network and a highly-trained marketing team.
 
Our experienced sales team has the industry knowledge and know-how to synergistically combine our strong market insight with a successful commercialization platform.
 
We have developed high-quality relationships with leading hospital and clinic administrators and physicians.


While sales of our pharmaceutical products to hospitals are made through our distributors, we believe our long-term relationships with leading hospitals and healthcare clinics throughout China resulting from our long-term promotional efforts and periodic physician seminars improve the perception of our products in the marketplace and help us identify and select high-volume drugs to develop into new generic products relatively early in the process.
 
We cooperate effectively with a number of leading academic research institutions.


Through our cooperative efforts with leading academic research institutions, which are our research partners, we are able to develop new product candidates in a cost-effective manner and currently have a number of significant projects in active development in our pipeline.


Notwithstanding such favorable positioning, we are subject to intense competition. There are both local and overseas pharmaceutical enterprises that are engaged in the manufacture and sale of potential substitute or similar pharmaceutical products in the PRC. These competitors may have more capital, better research and development resources, better manufacturing and marketing capability, and more experience than we do.


20

 

Our profitability may be adversely affected if:
 

● | the number of our competitors increases; 
--+---------------------------------------------


● | competitors engage in increased price competition; or 
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | competitors develop new products or product substitutes having comparable medicinal applications or therapeutic effects that are more effective, less costly and/or have more perceived benefits than those produced by us. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, imported products and China’s admission as a member of the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) creates increased competition. The PRC became a member of the WTO in December 2001. As a result, competition in the pharmaceutical industry in the PRC intensified generally in two respects. First, with lower import tariffs, imported pharmaceutical products manufactured overseas may become increasingly competitive in terms of pricing. Second, we believe that well-established foreign pharmaceutical manufacturers may set up production facilities in the PRC and compete with domestic manufacturers directly. With the expected increased supply of competitively-priced pharmaceutical products in the PRC, we may face increased competition from foreign pharmaceutical products, especially in terms of high-end pharmaceutical products, including certain types of products manufactured by U.S. manufacturers.


Intellectual Property


We regard our packaging designs, trademarks, trade secrets, patent and similar intellectual property as part of our core competence that is critical to our success. We rely on patent, trademark and trade secret law, as well as confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees, distributors and others to protect our intellectual property rights.


In November 2008, we purchased the patented medical formula for a cerebral/cardio-vascular indication and the manufacturing processes for that product from a third party laboratory. In connection with that acquisition, we obtained the title of the patent. This patent expires in 2025.


21

 

In 2012, we acquired another patent related to a medical formula for the treatment of cerebral/cardio-vascular diseases. This patent expires in 2029.


As of December 31, 2017, we owned 17 registered trademarks, including marks for nine of the 19 pharmaceutical products we manufacture, including the tradenames Funalin, Fukexing, Beisha, Shiduotai, Xinuo, Pusenlitai, Pusenouke, Shuchang and Shenkaineng, as well as marks for our AFGF logo, our HPS logo, our two HELPSON logos and four other logos. The registration numbers of the 17 registered trademarks are as follows: No.1280259, No.1500459, No.1511770, No.1535416, No.1537828, No.1535420, No.1272792, No.1272759, No.1272760, No.1330294, No.1327731, No.1330295, No.1476339, No.3993785, No. 4074317, No.4074321 and No. 4315247.


Environmental Matters
 
We comply with the Environmental Protection Law of China as well as applicable local regulations. In addition to statutory and regulatory compliance, we actively ensure the environmental sustainability of our operations. Penalties may be levied upon us if we fail to adhere to and maintain certain standards. Such failure has not occurred in the past, and we generally do not anticipate that it will occur in the future, but no assurance can be given in this regard.
Regulations
 
Regulations Relating to Pharmaceutical Industry. The pharmaceutical industry in China is highly regulated. The primary regulatory authority is the CFDA, including its provincial and local branches. As a developer and producer of medicinal products, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the CFDA and its provincial and local branches. The Law of the PRC on the Administration of Pharmaceuticals provides the basic legal framework for the administration of the production and sale of pharmaceuticals in China and covers the manufacturing, distribution, packaging, pricing and advertising of pharmaceutical products. These regulations set forth detailed rules with respect to the administration of pharmaceuticals in China. We are also subject to other PRC laws and regulations that are applicable to business operators, manufacturers and distributors in general.
 
22

 

Registration and Approval of Medicine. Pursuant to the PRC Provisions for Drug Registration, a medicine must be registered and approved by the CFDA before it can be manufactured and sold. The registration and approval process requires the manufacturer to submit to the CFDA a registration application containing detailed information concerning the efficacy and quality of the medicine and the manufacturing process and the production facilities the manufacturer expects to use. This process generally takes two to five years and could be longer, depending on the nature of the medicine under review, the quality of the data provided and the workload of the CFDA. If a manufacturer chooses to manufacture a pre-clinical medicine, it is also required to conduct pre-clinical trials, apply to the CFDA for permission to conduct clinical trials and go through the clinical trials. If a manufacturer chooses to manufacture a post-clinical medicine, it only needs to go through the clinical trials. In both cases, a manufacturer needs to file clinical data with the CFDA for approval for manufacturing after clinical trials are completed.
 
New Medicine. If a new medicine is approved by the CFDA, the CFDA will issue a new medicine certificate to the manufacturer and impose a monitoring period of one to five years. During the monitoring period, the CFDA will monitor the safety of the new medicine, and will neither accept new medicine certificate applications for an identical medicine by another pharmaceutical company, nor approve the production or import of an identical medicine by other pharmaceutical companies. As a result of these regulations, the holder of a new medicine certificate has the exclusive right to manufacture it during the monitoring period. We currently have new medicine certificates for our Pusenouke, Cefaclor dispersible tablets and Roxithromycin dispersible tablets and Bumetanide for injection products.
 
National Production Standard and Provisional Standard. In connection with the CFDA’s approval of a new medicine, the CFDA will normally direct the manufacturer to produce the medicine according to a provisional national production standard, or a provisional standard. A provisional standard is valid for two years, during which time the CFDA closely monitors the production process and quality consistency of the medicine to develop a national final production standard for the medicine, or a final standard. Three months before the expiration of the two-year period, the manufacturer is required to apply to the CFDA to convert the provisional standard to a final standard. Upon approval, the CFDA will publish the final standard for production. The CFDA has no statutory timeline to complete its review and grant approval for the conversion. In practice, the approval for conversion to a final standard is time-consuming and could take a number of years. However, during the CFDA’s review period, the manufacturer may continue to produce the medicine according to the provisional standard.


23

 

Transitional Period. Prior to the latter of (1) the expiration of a new medicine’s monitoring period or (2) the date when the CFDA grants a final standard for a new medicine after the expiration of the provisional standard, the CFDA will not accept applications for an identical medicine nor will it approve the production of an identical medicine by other pharmaceutical companies. Accordingly, the manufacturer will continue to have an exclusive production right for the new medicine during this transitional period.


Continuing CFDA Regulation
 
Pharmaceutical manufacturers in China are subject to continuing regulation by the CFDA. If the labeling or its manufacturing process of an approved medicine is significantly modified, a new pre-market approval or pre-market approval supplement will be required by the CFDA. A pharmaceutical manufacturer is subject to periodic inspection and safety monitoring by the CFDA to determine compliance with regulatory requirements.


The CFDA has a variety of enforcement actions available to enforce its regulations and rules, including fines and injunctions, recall or seizure of products, the imposition of operating restrictions, partial suspension or complete shutdown of production and criminal prosecution.
 
Pharmaceutical Product Manufacturing


Permits and Licenses for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers. A pharmaceutical manufacturer must obtain a pharmaceutical manufacturing permit from the CFDA’s relevant provincial branch. This permit is valid for five years and is renewable for an additional five-year period upon its expiration. Our current pharmaceutical manufacturing permit, issued by the CFDA, will expire on December 31, 2020.


Good Manufacturing Practice. A pharmaceutical manufacturer must meet the Good Manufacturing Practice standards, or GMP standards, for each of its production facilities in China in respect of each form of pharmaceutical product it produces. GMP standards include staff qualifications, production premises and facilities, equipment, raw materials, environmental hygiene, production management, quality control and customer complaint administration. If a manufacturer meets the GMP standards, the CFDA will issue to the manufacturer a Good Manufacturing Practice certificate, or a GMP certificate, with a five-year validity period. However, for a newly-established pharmaceutical manufacturer that meets the GMP standards, the CFDA will issue a GMP certificate with only a one-year validity period. The New GMP Standards became effective on March 1, 2011 and pharmaceutical manufacturers (except manufacturers of injectables, blood products or vaccines, which have a three-year grace period) have a five-year grace period to upgrade existing facilities to comply with the revisions.
 
24

 

We obtained three GMP certificates for our manufacturing facility in respect of the majority form of pharmaceutical products we produce, one is valid until October 30, 2019 (lyophilized powder for injection, small volume parenteral solutions), the second is valid until January 2020 (tablets, capsules), and the third is valid until December 6, 2020 (tables, capsule - cephalosprins). All of our GMP certificates are valid for five years. While we are required to implement certain upgrades to our manufacturing facilities to comply with the new GMP standards, we do not currently anticipate any difficulty in renewing these certificates when we finish the facility upgrading.


Product Liability and Consumers Protection


Product liability claims may arise if any pharmaceutical products have a harmful effect on a consumer, and result in an injured party making a claim for damages or compensation. The General Principles of the Civil Law of the PRC, which became effective in January 1987, state that manufacturers and sellers of defective products causing property damage or injury shall incur civil liabilities for such damage or injuries.


The Product Quality Law of the PRC was enacted in 1993 and amended in 2000 to strengthen the quality control of products and protect consumers’ rights and interests. Under this law, manufacturers and distributors who produce or sell defective products may be subject to confiscation of earnings from such sales, revocation of business licenses and imposition of fines, and in severe circumstances, may be subject to criminal liability.
 
The Law of the PRC on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Consumers was promulgated on October 31, 1993 and became effective on January 1, 1994 to protect consumers when they purchase or use goods or services. All business operators must comply with this law when they manufacture or sell goods and/or provide services to customers. In extreme situations, pharmaceutical product manufacturers and distributors may be subject to criminal liability if their goods or services lead to the death or injuries of customers or other third parties.

Price Controls
 
The State Council of China promulgated the “Notice on Printing and Advocating Opinions on Promoting the Reform of Drug Prices” in 2015. Not including narcotic drugs and psychotropic drugs of the first category, the prices of drugs originally designed by the government were abolished beginning in June 1, 2015.


The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security announced the results of the Negotiations on the Catalogue of Medicare Drugs on July 9, 2017: 36 drugs have been successfully added to the Medicare Drug List, among which a variety of tumor-targeting drugs are listed, as well as drugs for treating major diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and hemophilia. Compared with the average retail price in 2016, the average price drop in negotiated drugs reached 44%, with the highest drop of 70%. In April this year, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Sciences announced a list of 44 drugs to be negotiated. After negotiating with related companies, 36 drugs were successfully negotiated and were subsequently included in the “National Basic Medical Insurance, Industrial Injury Insurance and Maternity Insurance Drug Catalog (2017 Edition)” category B drugs.


In January 2017, the State Council issued the “13th Five-Year Plan for Deepening the Reform of the Medical and Health Care System”, and called for all levels of public hospitals to implement comprehensive reforms in 2017, and to abolish the practice of mark-ups on medicine (with the exception of Chinese herbs).


On February 12, 2018, the State Council Information Office held a press release on deepening medical reform and improving medical services. Mr. Wang Hesheng, deputy director of the National Health and Family Planning Commission and director of the State Council’s Medical Reform Office, reiterated the current policy: It is strictly forbidden to link the income of medical personnel with the income of medicines, consumables, and inspections, and to control the unreasonable growth of medical expenses scientifically. The increase in the organization’s medical expenses dropped from 21% in 2010 to about 10% in 2017. In respect to drug use, drug prices are reduced through various measures such as centralized bidding and procurement, national negotiations on drug prices, and control of irrational use of drugs. The latest round of price reductions for pharmaceuticals in the province as a unit averaged more than 15%.

Reimbursement under the National Medical Insurance Program


According to the “Notice of Doing a Basic Health Insurance Work for Urban Residents in 2017” issued by the Ministry of Social Affairs of the People’s Republic of China in 2017: to raise the financial subsidy standard. Namely the per capita subsidy standard for resident medical insurance at all levels of finance will increase by RMB30 (approximately USD 5) on the basis of 2016, with an average of RMB450 (approximately USD 69) per person per year. Among them, the central government subsidizes the western and central regions in proportions of 80% and 60% respectively, and grants subsidies to each province in the eastern region according to a certain percentage. In 2017, the per capita personal payment standards for medical insurance for urban and rural residents will increase by RMB30 (approximately USD 5) on the basis of 2016, with an average of RMB180 (approximately USD 28) per person per year.


In the urban residents’ medical insurance policy in 2017, the proportion of compensation for inpatient medical expenses will be about 75%, and the proportion of basic medical institutions paying for general outpatient visits shall not be less than 50%. The proportion of reimbursement from different levels of medical institutions has been initiated, and the medical insurance payment policy has been favors the grass-roots level to facilitate full use of basic medical and health resources and promote the formation of hierarchical diagnosis and treatment.
 
Although it is designated as a national program, the implementation of the NMIP is delegated to various provincial governments, each of which has established its own medicine catalog. A provincial government must include all Tier 1 medicines listed in the national medicine catalog in its provincial medicine catalog, but may use its discretion based on its own selection criteria to add other medicines to, or exclude Tier 2 medicines listed in the national medicine catalog from its provincial medicine catalog, so long as the combined numbers of the medicines added and excluded do not exceed 15% of the number of the Tier 2 medicines listed in the national catalog. In addition, provincial governments may use their discretion to upgrade a nationally classified Tier 2 medicine to Tier 1 in their provincial medicine catalogs, but may not downgrade a nationally classified Tier 1 medicine to Tier 2.


The total amount of reimbursement for the cost of prescription and OTC medicines, in addition to other medical expenses, for an individual program participant in a calendar year is capped at the amount in that participant’s individual account. The amount in a participant’s account varies, depending upon the amount of contributions from the participant and his or her employer. Generally, on average, program participants who are from relatively wealthier eastern parts of China and relatively wealthier metropolitan centers have greater amounts in their individual accounts than those from less developed provinces.
 
27

 

Currently, 18 of our pharmaceutical products are listed on the National Insurance Catalogue (NIC), and three of our products - Cefalexin, Clarithromycin and Omeprazole - are listed on the Essential Drug List (EDL). However, some of our non-EDL drugs have been selected to enter the provincial EDL, which varies from province to province. We believe these drugs will experience an increase in sales volume due to the government-initiated promotion of those drugs, while remaining free from the pricing pressures often experienced by drugs listed on the EDL.


Other Regulations


In addition to the regulations relating to pharmaceutical industry in China, we are also subject to the regulations applicable to a foreign invested enterprise in China.


Foreign Currency Exchange. Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules promulgated in 1996 and amended in 1997 and various regulations issued by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or the SAFE, and other relevant PRC government authorities, Renminbi is freely convertible only to the extent of current account items, such as trade-related receipts and payments, interests and dividends. Capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, require the prior approval from the SAFE or its local counterpart for conversion of Renminbi into a foreign currency, such as U.S. dollars, and remittance of the foreign currency outside the PRC.
 
Payments for transactions that take place within the PRC must be made in Renminbi. Unless otherwise approved, PRC companies other than foreign investment enterprises (FIEs) must convert foreign currency payments they receive from abroad into Renminbi. On the other hand, FIEs may retain foreign currency in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks, subject to a cap set by the SAFE or its local counterpart.


Dividend Distribution. Under the PRC regulations governing dividend distributions by wholly foreign-owned enterprises and Sino-foreign equity joint ventures, wholly foreign-owned enterprises and Sino-foreign equity joint ventures in the PRC may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Additionally, these foreign-invested enterprises are required to set aside certain amounts of their accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.


Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 296 employees, among which 276 employees were full-time employees and 20 employees were temporary employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and, in general, we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.


As required by applicable Chinese law, we have entered into employment contracts with substantially all of our officers, managers and employees. We are working towards entering into employment contracts with those employees who do not currently have employment contracts with us. The PRC enacted a new Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008. We have updated our employment contracts and employee handbook and are in compliance with such law.
