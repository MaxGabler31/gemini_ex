Item 1.    Business
Business Combination

Rimini Street, Inc. (“RSI”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 2005. RSI provides enterprise software support services.

In May 2017, RSI entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with GP Investments Acquisition Corp. (“GPIA”), a publicly-held special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) incorporated in the Cayman Islands and formed for the purpose of effecting a business combination with one or more businesses. Substantially all of GPIA’s assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents. The Merger Agreement was approved by the respective shareholders of RSI and GPIA in October 2017, and closing occurred on October 10, 2017, resulting in (i) the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of GPIA with and into RSI, with RSI as the surviving corporation, after which (ii) RSI merged with and into GPIA, with GPIA as the surviving corporation. Prior to consummation of the mergers, GPIA domesticated as a Delaware corporation (the “Delaware Domestication”). Immediately after the Delaware Domestication and the consummation of the second merger, GPIA was renamed “Rimini Street, Inc.” (referred to herein as the Company, as distinguished from RSI with the same legal name). Since RSI is the predecessor of the Company for accounting and financial reporting purposes, the Company’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts and activities of RSI before the mergers, and those of the Company after the mergers, except where the context indicates otherwise.

After completion of the Delaware Domestication and upon consummation of the mergers, RSI appointed seven of the nine members of the Board of Directors of the Company, and the former shareholders of RSI obtained an 83% controlling interest in the outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock. Due to the change of control and the composition of GPIA’s assets, the mergers were accounted for as a reverse recapitalization whereby RSI is considered to be the predecessor and the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes, and GPIA is the legal acquirer. The exchange ratio for the mergers resulted in the issuance of approximately 0.2394 shares of the Company’s Common Stock for each previously outstanding share of RSI capital stock (the “Exchange Ratio”) on October 10, 2017. In accounting for the reverse recapitalization, the net monetary assets received by the Company as a result of the merger with GPIA were treated as an equity infusion on the closing date.
Business Overview
Rimini Street, Inc. and its subsidiaries (together the "Company" or "we") is a global provider of enterprise software support products and services, and the leading independent software support provider for Oracle and SAP products, based on both the number of active clients supported and recognition by industry analyst firms. We founded our company to disrupt and redefine the enterprise software support market by developing and delivering innovative new products and services that fill a then unmet need in the market. We believe we have achieved and sustained our leadership position in independent enterprise software support by delivering on our mission to provide extraordinary technology solutions that achieve each client’s strategic, operational, and financial goals. 
In September 2020, we announced the global availability of our award-winning, mission-critical, 24x7x365 support, application management, security and migration services beyond proprietary databases to leading open source database platforms, including MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL and MongoDB. 
In November 2019, we announced the global availability of our Application Management Services (“AMS”) for Oracle, which includes coverage for Oracle Database, Middleware and a wide range of Oracle applications including E-Business Suite, JD Edwards, PeopleSoft and Siebel. In addition to leveraging our support services for Oracle that replaces expensive and less robust software vendor annual support with a more responsive and comprehensive support offering, our clients can now have us manage their Oracle systems day-to-day with an integrated application management and support service provided by a single trusted vendor. As an integrated service, we believe we can provide clients a better model, better people, and better outcomes with higher satisfaction and significant savings of time, labor and money. The AMS for Oracle includes system administration, operational support, health monitoring and enhancement support.
In August 2019, we announced plans to globally offer AMS for SAP enterprise software, expanding the scope of support services we offer clients globally. This AMS service is in addition to our traditional enterprise Support Services. We are already providing this new SAP AMS service to clients in North and South America. The service includes system 
-1-


administration and SAP Basis support, system health monitoring with proactive analysis, preventative system recommendations and event detection; and enhancement support for complex SAP software landscapes.
In 2018 we announced support for Software as a Service (“SaaS”) solutions beginning with Salesforce products. As a partner of Salesforce, we provide our award-winning service and support for custom code, release updates and application integrations in addition to ongoing administrative, configuration and enhancement of Salesforce’s industry leading cloud solutions. We also provide support to clients for additional SaaS solutions that we will formally announce in the future. By providing support for SaaS as well as traditionally licensed enterprise software, Rimini Street unifies support for its clients across applications and software delivery models from one trusted provider, creating efficiencies and savings, simplifying support processes and enabling improved support outcomes.
Enterprise software support products and services is one of the largest categories of overall global information technology (“IT”) spending. We believe core enterprise resource planning (“ERP”), customer relationship management (“CRM”), product lifecycle management (“PLM”) and technology software platforms have become increasingly important in the operation of mission-critical business processes over the last 30 years, and also that the costs associated with failure, downtime, security exposure and maintaining the tax, legal and regulatory compliance of these core software systems have also increased. As a result, we believe that licensees often view software support as a mandatory cost of doing business, resulting in recurring and highly profitable revenue streams for enterprise software vendors. For example, for fiscal year 2021, SAP reported that support revenue represented approximately 41% of its total revenue and, for fiscal year 2021, Oracle reported a margin of 85% for cloud services and license support. 
We believe that software vendor support is an increasingly costly model that has not evolved to offer licensees the responsiveness, quality, breadth of capabilities or value needed to meet the needs of licensees. Organizations are under increasing pressure to reduce their IT costs while also delivering improved business performance through the adoption and integration of emerging technologies, such as mobile, virtualization, internet of things (“IoT”) and cloud computing. Today, however, the majority of IT budget is spent operating and maintaining existing infrastructure and systems, in part as a result of software vendor policies and support models that are designed to benefit the vendor and force organizations to follow a vendor-dictated roadmap. As a result, we believe organizations are increasingly seeking ways to create competitive advantage and growth by redirecting budgets from expensive maintenance programs and costs to new technology investments that provide greater strategic value. We believe our software products and services help clients achieve these objectives by reducing the total cost of support.
We believe that AMS for enterprise software is a large market with significant unmet needs in client satisfaction and value. Traditional AMS providers compete on price, but the traditional AMS model is broken with a focus on a “land and expand” model based on initial cheaper, less-skilled workers but higher costs over time and frequently poor client satisfaction or degradation in service over time. Providers usually contract for lower-cost services with a goal to grow revenue through scope creep by adding hours to open tickets or selling new project work. These lower-cost AMS support models sound cost-effective, but their contractual structures can both enable and incent traditional AMS providers to maximize their own revenue at the expense of their clients by “addressing” issues (sometimes neither quickly nor efficiently), but not necessarily resolving them or their root causes. In addition, traditional AMS offerings are disparate and separate from software vendor support, with inherent inefficiencies and gaps that further limit responsiveness, root cause analysis and business value.
We believe organizations are realizing the value of an integrated, expert-led Support and AMS offering that eliminates inefficiencies, realizes joint value from the resolution of root causes that reduce issue volumes over time, and improves client satisfaction. Through our solution offerings, Rimini Street provides expert, ultra-responsive support and AMS, functioning as an extension of IT teams, with engineers available 24x7x365 around the globe for all AMS and enterprise software projects, and to fill skill gaps or help with rightsizing enterprise teams. Rimini Street teams deliver a wide variety of desired outcomes for a broad range of use cases such as supporting entire enterprise software systems, reducing costs, clearing backlogs, or facilitating the redeployment of IT teams for more strategic initiatives.
As of December 31, 2021, we employed over 1,660 professionals and supported over 2,840 active clients globally, including 72 Fortune 500 companies and 16 Fortune Global 100 companies, across a broad range of industries. We define an active client as a distinct entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a business unit of a company that purchases our services to support a specific product. For example, we count as two separate active client instances in circumstances where we provide support for two different products to the same entity. We market and sell our services globally, primarily through our direct sales force, and currently have wholly-owned subsidiaries in Australia, Brazil, UAE (Dubai), France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. We believe our primary competitors are the enterprise software vendors whose products we service and support, including IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP.

Our subscription-based revenue provides a strong foundation for, and visibility into, future period results. We generated revenue of $374.4 million, $326.8 million and $281.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of 15% and 16% for 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have a history of losses, and as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $225.8 million. We had net income of $75.2 million, $11.6 million and $21.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We generated approximately 53%, 59% and 64% of our revenue in the United States and approximately 47%, 41% and 36% of our revenue from our international business for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
 
Our Industry
We believe most enterprise software vendors have historically licensed the rights for customers to use their software. In a traditional licensing model, the customer typically procures a perpetual software license and pays for the license in a single upfront fee (“perpetual license”), and base software support services can be optionally procured from the software vendor for an annual fee that averages 22% of the total cost of the software license. In a newer subscription-based licensing model, such as software as a service, or SaaS, the customer generally pays as it goes for usage of the software on a monthly or annual basis (“subscription license”). Under a subscription license, the product license and a base level of software support are generally bundled together as a single purchase, and the base level of software support is not procured separately nor is it an optional purchase.

In our experience, the base level of software support provided by enterprise software vendors for both perpetual licenses and subscription licenses has traditionally been delivered through call centers and generally includes the right to receive and use product support services, software bug fixes, and functional, technical, tax, legal and regulatory updates. In both licensing models, software support also generally includes the right to receive and use new releases of the licensed products, if and when made available. Base software support provided by enterprise software vendors for both models generally excludes other important, commonly needed enterprise services, such as support for interoperability, security, software performance, how-to questions, add-ons and customizations. Some enterprise software vendors do not include major new releases in the base support services, and instead, they charge additional license fees for such releases.
We believe enterprise software vendors have historically been the primary providers of software support services for their products, enabling such vendors to dictate which products and releases are supported and for how long, the scope of support services offered, service levels, terms and pricing. We believe the lack of credible competitors of any scale left software licensees with little choice but to agree to the software vendors’ terms of service, or risk potential tax, legal and regulatory non-compliance or failures of critical systems that require knowledge and skill sets beyond a licensee’s own abilities to resolve. Some software vendor support customers may be required to perform expensive and disruptive upgrades to newer product releases - even if they find no business value in doing so - just to remain eligible to receive full support.
We believe enterprises are steadily increasing their use of open source databases, which have now surpassed commercial databases in popularity according to DB-Engines, in order to save on license and support costs, speed time to results, and avoid complex license compliance issues. We believe there is a gap in open source database support for enterprises. Trial-and-error self-support and open source community support are generally insufficient to allow IT organizations to meet service level requirements of business applications or to bring nonproduction workloads under their administration. We further believe enterprises seek help in navigating how to migrate parts of their enterprise software portfolio to open source software and in supporting the resulting hybrid environment.
In our experience, enterprises are not broadly satisfied with the service level and quality of current AMS available in the market. We believe traditional AMS models are based on initial cheaper, less-skilled workers but higher costs over time and frequently poor client satisfaction or improvement in service over time. We believe enterprises are increasingly recognizing that these lower-cost AMS support models sound cost-effective, but their contractual structures can both enable and incent traditional AMS providers to maximize their own revenue at the expense of their clients. We also believe there are gaps in service levels and efficiency between software vendor support and AMS offerings that limit responsiveness, root cause analysis and business value.
Today, we believe many organizations are defining business-driven roadmaps that better enable competitive advantage and growth by combining different software under perpetual, subscription and open source licenses into an integrated business platform that is deployed across their own systems and cloud providers, commonly referred to as hybrid IT environments. For these organizations, the cost of operating and supporting their hybrid IT environments consumes too many financial and labor resources and prevents the strategic investment that is needed to compete effectively, grow revenue and improve margins.
-3-


For all these reasons and others, we believe the software products and services historically offered by software vendors, such as IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP, do not meet the full and evolving needs of their customers across perpetual, subscription and open source software, and are too expensive. We further believe that disparate AMS offerings from other managed service providers are disconnected from the needs of enterprises and promote incremental costs and inefficiencies. The product, service and cost gaps have created a significant market opportunity for our unique portfolio of solutions for software support and management to meet the underserved needs of enterprise software licensees at a value-driven price point.
 Our Solutions
Our subscription-based software support products and services offer enterprise software licensees a choice of solutions that replace or supplement the support products and services offered by enterprise software vendors for their products. Features, service levels, service breadth, technology and pricing differentiate our software products and services from our competitors. We believe clients utilize our software products and services to achieve their strategic, operational, and financial objectives.
At a more granular level, our support services enable our clients to achieve substantial cost savings; receive more responsive and comprehensive support; obtain support for their customized software that is not generally covered under the enterprise software vendor’s service offerings; enhance their software functionality, capabilities, and data usage; and protect their systems and extend the life of their existing software releases and products. Our products and services seek to enable our clients to keep their mission-critical systems operating smoothly and to remain in tax, legal and regulatory compliance; improve productivity; and better allocate limited budgets, labor and other resources to investments that provide competitive advantage and support growth.
The following table summarizes and compares our base software support features to what management believes in its experience are the typical features of enterprise software vendors:

Base Software Support Feature | Rimini Street | Typical Enterprise Software Vendor
Significant Annual Cost and Resource Savings Compared to the Software Vendor | • | 
Guaranteed 10-Minute Response Time 24x7 For Critical (Priority 1) Issues | • |

When we provide base software support for a perpetual license, we generally offer our clients service for a fee that is equal to approximately 50% of the annual fees charged by the software vendor for their base support. When providing supplemental software support for a perpetual license, where the client procures our support service in addition to retaining the software vendor’s base support, we generally offer our clients service for a fee that is equal to approximately 25% of the annual fees charged by the software vendor for their base support. For support services relating to a subscription license, we generally offer our clients support and managed services for a fee based on the scope of the deployment and desired outcomes. We also offer a special support service, Rimini Street Extra Secure Support, available to clients that require a more rigorous level of security background checks for engineers accessing the client’s system than our standard employment security background check process. Rimini Street Extra Secure Support is an additional fee added to our base or supplemental support fee. Subscriptions for additional software products and services are available, designed to meet specific client needs and provide exceptional value for the fees charged.
Since our inception over 16 years ago, we have invested significant resources developing our proprietary knowledge, software tools and processes to meet the growing needs of our clients. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we have delivered approximately 97,000 tax, legal and regulatory updates to our global client base. We believe that we offer the most comprehensive scope of tax, legal and regulatory research from a single vendor, including collecting and analyzing information from more than 4,100 government sites, close to 3,500 information sources and over 26,000 localities for over 140 countries. We utilize a certified triple-scope verification process that involves multiple third-parties such as premier subject matter experts including industry associations as well as accounting, consulting and law firms. Our capabilities are enabled by our proprietary data capture, management and analysis tool and ISO 9001:2015 based management system processes that we believe provide us with a significant competitive advantage.

Sales and Marketing
We sell our solutions through our global direct sales organization. We organize our sales force by geographic region with sales teams currently covering North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Asia-Pacific. We organize our sales and marketing professionals into territory-specific teams in order to align sales and marketing towards common sales goals. In some cases, we organize our sales professionals in a specific region or territory by the industry of our prospective clients. A typical sales cycle with a prospective client begins with the generation of a sales lead through trade shows, industry events, online marketing, outbound calling or other means of referral. The sales cycle for our support services continues with an assessment of the prospective client’s support contract renewal date, sales presentations and, in many cases, client reference calls. Our sales cycle can vary substantially from client to client, but typically requires six to twelve months. Enterprise software customers typically need to renew their contracts on an annual basis so there is already budget for our support services, and that budget is usually larger than our fees since most of our prospective clients are enterprise software vendor customers paying higher annual fees for their current support services. The sales cycle for our AMS or other services, 
-5-


beyond our core support services, may or may not be replacing the services of an incumbent vendor and therefore may not be dependent on the renewal date of an existing annual contract.
We attempt to commence discussions with prospective clients far enough in advance of that prospective client’s current support service end date to provide enough time to complete the sale and to perform certain transition tasks. In certain situations, we will engage with a prospective client over multiple renewal cycles. In addition to new client sales and sales to existing clients, we have a dedicated sales team focused on renewals of existing clients.
We generate prospect leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs. Our marketing programs target chief financial officers, chief information officers, other IT executives, senior business leaders and procurement specialists, focusing on the unique benefits of our offerings. Additionally, our marketing programs serve to create further market awareness of the benefits of independent enterprise software support and our broader portfolio of support and related offerings. As a result of our efforts in educating organizations on the alternatives to vendor support, we believe we are recognized as a thought leader in this market.
Our marketing programs include the following:
•use of our website to provide application and company information, as well as learning opportunities for potential customers;
•business development representatives who respond to incoming leads to convert them into new sales opportunities;
•participation in, and sponsorship of, field marketing events including user conferences, trade shows and industry events;
•online marketing activities including email campaigns, online advertising and webinars;
•public relations; and
•thought leadership through marketing to industry analysts, webinars, speaking engagements and sponsored research.
Competitive Strengths

We believe that we have a number of competitive advantages that will enable us to strengthen our position as the leading independent provider of enterprise software support. Our key competitive strengths include:
Unique enterprise software support model, products and services
Our enterprise software support model, products and services differentiate us from traditional enterprise software vendors. We built our company from the ground up to disrupt the 30-year old traditional enterprise software vendor support model. We are focused on delivering unique, highly responsive and award-winning enterprise software support solutions. We believe our innovative support products and services, offered at a value-driven price point, provide a significant return on investment for our clients that cannot be achieved by use of traditional enterprise software vendor offerings. Our highly qualified Primary Support Engineers have an average of over 20 years of relevant industry experience, which provides us with a competitive advantage and is a key element of our proven track record of providing exceptional client service.
Comprehensive support services
We offer clients a comprehensive suite of independent support offerings in terms of features and capabilities; global breadth; vendor products and releases supported; and tax, legal and regulatory updates. We believe our continued investment in our software support products and services will expand our scope of services to the benefit of our clients.
Scalable business model
We have developed proprietary knowledge, software tools and processes in the design, development and delivery of our enterprise software support services. We have also designed an innovative support model that organizes our support engineers into modular, scalable teams. We believe our client support model enables us to quickly and cost-effectively scale to meet growing global demand in our existing product lines. We have become proficient at applying our support methodologies and approach to new product lines, enabling us to rapidly and efficiently support additional enterprise software products in the future. We have increased our ability to scale by investing in support-related infrastructure and by developing patent pending artificial intelligence support applications that further optimize our support processes and ensure service delivery outcomes at scale for our clients. Additionally, we have received ISO certifications for our support services, which we believe helps ensure our clients consistently receive high quality, responsive service as our client base continues to grow.

Large global client base

As of December 31, 2021, we supported over 2,840 active clients globally, including 72 Fortune 500 companies and 16 Fortune Global 100 companies. We also believe that our proven ability to deliver value to an extensive list of clients across a broad range of industries validates our business model and provides us with important references to prospective clients.
Clear leadership position
We are the global leader of independent enterprise software support services for Oracle and SAP products, based on both number of active clients and recognition by industry analyst firms. We believe we have substantial thought leadership in our market through our extensive marketing efforts and promotion of the independent enterprise software support model, including participation in key industry conferences, publishing white papers and hosting webinars. We believe that our position as the market leader enables us to bring new services to market more quickly, attract and retain high quality personnel, and acquire new clients.
Highly experienced management team
Our senior management team has over 150 years of combined experience in the enterprise software and services industry with companies such as Accenture, Agile, EDS, Hewlett-Packard, JD Edwards, Oracle, PeopleSoft, Rackspace, Saba, and SAP and with a significant amount of time and experience focused on building, managing and delivering support products and services. We believe our senior management team’s significant relevant industry experience positions us to continue to extend our market leadership.
Client-centric culture
We believe that our culture is a key element of our success and one of our core values. We recruit employees who share a passion for delivering exceptional service to our clients and continuously measure, recognize and reward employees for achieving exemplary client satisfaction. We further believe that our culture has enabled us to attract and retain high quality, experienced and skilled professionals. Over the years, we have earned exceptional customer satisfaction ratings and have won numerous Stevie Awards for customer service.

Our Growth Strategy
We possess deep expertise in enterprise software products, services and support and intend to leverage our leadership position to further penetrate our current markets and expand our support product and service capabilities into new markets. The key elements of our growth strategy include:
Add new clients
We believe that the market for independent enterprise software support products and services is large, growing and underserved. We expect significant growth opportunities in our market as organizations increasingly look to achieve more value from their technology budgets. We are continuing to make significant investments in sales and marketing and will continue our strong focus on acquiring new clients.
Continue global expansion
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated approximately 47% of our revenue outside of the United States. We believe that there is a large opportunity to grow our global business by increasing our direct sales force and by selective utilization of strategic marketing and sales partnerships around the world. We attribute revenue to individual countries based on the location of the contracting entity. No foreign country comprised more than 10% of revenue for the three-year period ended December 31, 2021.
 Expand the portfolio of supported vendors and products

Since our inception over 16 years ago, we have developed a comprehensive portfolio of enterprise software support and related products and services, including Support Services for applications, technologies and databases, Management Services for applications, technologies, databases, cloud and security, Professional Services, and more than 20 Rimini Street products. These products and services cover over 40,000 SKUs of software and technologies from primarily five software vendors, Oracle, SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft and IBM, as well as for open source software. We believe there is a significant 
-7-


market opportunity to offer support for additional product lines, and we intend to extend our support service offerings to additional enterprise software products.

Capitalize on the shift to hybrid IT
We believe organizations are increasingly creating more complex IT environments that are a mixture of multiple technologies, business models and vendors, including perpetual license and subscription license software solutions, deployed across the client’s system and cloud computing providers (hybrid IT environments), and consisting of proprietary and non-proprietary open source software, all from a multitude of different technology vendors. We believe traditional enterprise software vendors and general consulting firms cannot effectively support these heterogeneous environments because of complex integrations, customizations, multi-vendor relationships and other unique challenges. Further, we believe a hybrid IT strategy enables organizations to reliably and cost-effectively run their business on an existing, stable core enterprise software platform, while at the same time enabling them to more quickly adopt new innovative applications and services, including digital, cloud, mobile and analytics. Multi-application, multi-environment solutions create a unique growth opportunity for independent support providers like Rimini Street.

Further penetrate our existing client base
We intend to increase adoption of our services among our existing clients by selling additional support contracts for other software products within their organizations as well as contracts for new services, including AMS, security, and other services. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 63% of our over 1,470 unique clients have selected us to provide support for more than one product line, and we believe there is additional opportunity for growth with our existing client base. Our client-centric focus in combination with the critical nature of our services, enables us to maintain close working relationships with primary decision makers, which we believe helps us identify and capitalize on additional growth opportunities, including products, business divisions and geographies, within our existing client base. 
 Expand AMS global offering 
AMS for SAP and Oracle enterprise software was launched during the second half of 2019 and integrates our ultra-responsive traditional Support Services with clients day-to-day AMS needs. AMS is comprised of system administration, operational support, health monitoring and enhancement support and we believe this offering can provide clients a better model, better people, and better outcomes with higher satisfaction and significant savings of time, labor and money. In addition, as a Salesforce partner, we offer premium support for their Salesforce Sales Cloud, Salesforce Service Cloud, and other Salesforce products.
Launch new enterprise software support solutions
We intend to develop and bring to market new software products and services that help our clients with various business and support functions. For example, we announced Rimini Street Advanced Database Security in 2018, a new subscription product that, enhanced with technology from McAfee, a global leader in cybersecurity, protects databases from known vulnerabilities by monitoring and analyzing database communications traffic and allowing faster blocking of attempted attacks using advanced virtual patching technology. We more recently began offering Rimini Street Advanced Application Middleware Security, another subscription security product that protects applications and middleware against both known and unknown vulnerabilities.

Client Service Delivery
Client Support Delivery
Our Client Support Delivery operation is staffed globally and provides product support services to our clients 24 hours a day, seven days a week. A key element of our support delivery model is the assignment of one or more named Primary Support Engineers (“PSEs”), who serve as the primary product support contact for our clients. PSEs provide technical advice, functional expertise and general support to ensure the resolution of all support issues. Our PSEs are focused exclusively on supporting our clients and have on average over 20 years of experience and significant real-world understanding of client implementations and deployments. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we delivered an average support call response time of less than two minutes for an experienced engineer to engage with a client to address critical (P1) and serious (P2) issues, which is significantly shorter than the 10-minute guaranteed response time that is standard in our client support agreements.
-8-


Each PSE works as part of our global network of engineers, and provides deep expertise for a vendor, product family and product line. Support engineers across the company are able to leverage their collective knowledge and experience to meet the complex support needs of our clients.
In May 2020, we announced our first patent pending artificial intelligence support applications. These AI applications were developed by Rimini Street’s Global Service Delivery Innovation Team, whose mission is to invent innovative solutions that further enhance a client’s overall service experience. Built using open source technologies, the AI Applications can be integrated into support processes along with other new AI Applications when they become available. Our AI applications have already delivered substantial service benefits to clients, including accelerating case resolution times by an average of 23% and reducing cases that develop urgency by 29%.
Product Delivery
The Product Delivery team manages the scoping, development, testing and delivery of all client deliverables and internally developed applications, tools and technologies. The primary client deliverables are grouped into the following categories:
Global tax, legal and regulatory updates
We provide our clients with the proactive updates they need to maintain compliance with changing tax, payroll, accounting, fixed-asset and related rates, regulations and standards. In addition, we also create and update documentation that supports our tax, legal and regulatory updates.
New client synchronization
When a client switches to our support, they may not be up to date with the latest tax, legal and regulatory updates made available by the enterprise software vendor. As part of the client onboarding process, our Product Delivery team assesses the compliance level of each client deployment and creates initial updates as needed for clients to ensure full adherence to current tax, legal and regulatory standards in their jurisdictions of operation and to streamline the process for future updates.
We believe the quality and scope of our Product Delivery processes and deliverables surpass those of traditional enterprise software vendors. For example, we maintain updates for tax, legal, and regulatory changes for over 100 countries on a continuous basis by employing a rigorous software development lifecycle that complies with ISO 9001:2015 standards to ensure that required and identified tax, legal, and regulatory changes are delivered in an accurate and timely manner that based on management’s experience and analysis, we believe is typically earlier than traditional enterprise software vendors. Our Product Delivery organization is scalable and has the capability to deploy its solutions for additional countries based on the needs of our clients. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we have delivered over 97,000 tax, legal and regulatory updates to clients with quality and accuracy.
Product Delivery professionals serve in a variety of roles which include business, functional and technical analysts as well as software development, testing, quality assurance and delivery professionals. Scoping professionals and business analysts utilize proprietary methodologies to search for updates across all supported jurisdictions and provide support for all product groups. Technical and software development professionals are product-focused and have relevant domain expertise. Testing and delivery professionals are responsible for implementation of any changes and support all product groups. Engineers support all aspects of analysis, development and testing for the Product Delivery team. This flexible model has enabled us to identify best practices and solutions for the multiple product lines we service. Additionally, we utilize internally developed proprietary tools, technologies and processes to efficiently research and deliver quality and timely tax, legal and regulatory updates.
Client Engagement
Client success managers in our Client Engagement organization serve as a single point of contact for all non-product support related client issues. The Client Engagement organization works closely with our Support, Product Delivery and Sales organizations to provide an exceptional client experience with superior client satisfaction and success, with the ultimate goal of retention, renewal and expansion of our client contracts. The Client Engagement team oversees the following client management processes:
Onboarding
-9-


When a client switches to our support products and services, a client success manager oversees the onboarding process, which is a set of interwoven processes that new clients undertake to facilitate a successful migration to our support model. During this time, we help clients smoothly transition their support while we gain an in-depth understanding of a client’s business needs, IT infrastructure, IT strategies and objectives.
Account Management
Following the onboarding period, client success managers coordinate our resources and capabilities to provide personalized support to each client. When issues arise, client success managers escalate them within our organization as appropriate to help ensure client satisfaction. Client success managers are also tasked with establishing and maintaining executive relationships and promoting expansion of usage and cross-sell of our extensive services within each client’s organization.
Account Retention
Client success managers play an integral role in client retention by helping to ensure our clients are realizing the full value of our service offering and working with our Renewal Sales team on the renewal and extension of client contracts.
Clients
As of December 31, 2021, we supported over 2,840 active clients globally, including 72 Fortune 500 companies and 16 Fortune Global 100 companies across a broad range of industries. We define an active client as a distinct entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a business unit of a company that purchases our services to support a specific product. For example, we count as two separate active client instances in circumstances where we provide support for two different products to the same entity. We define a unique client as a distinct entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution or subsidiary, division or business unit of a company that purchases one or more of our products or services. For example, we count as two separate unique clients when two separate subsidiaries, divisions or business units of an entity purchase our products or services.
Employees and Human Capital Strategy
We have built our culture centered on our dedication to provide our clients with an exceptional service experience. Our employees focus on providing exceptional service to our clients, and we strive to foster an environment that enables and encourages them in this pursuit. To this end, we view all employees as partners and are committed to providing an exciting, participatory and team-oriented work environment. This commitment starts with our Core Values, known as our “4Cs”:
-10-


As a key aspect of our success, we believe our culture enables us to recruit and retain high quality talent. In addition, we strive to offer compensation, bonus and benefit programs appropriate for proven top-performing professionals. To ensure alignment with our short- and long-term objectives, our compensation programs for all employees include base pay, short-term incentives, and opportunities for long-term incentives. Furthermore, we believe our remote delivery model provides an attractive employment option for our highly experienced PSEs compared to consulting roles that can require significant travel and also reduces our carbon footprint, consistent with our interest in supporting environmental sustainability. Further, we offer programs and resources designed to support the mental, physical, social and financial well-being of our employees. In addition to resources available through our health care plan providers, we provide voluntary web-based training, using a videoconference platform, on health and wellness topics (such as first aid/CPR, fire safety, and how to prepare for inclement weather conditions), as well as professional development seminars on topics such as time management and leadership skills. 
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment and are proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to age, race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender or gender identity, disability and protected veterans’ status or any other characteristic protected by law.
In both 2020 and 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided special compensation bonuses for lower-paid employees and special compensation bonuses for the few of our employees who tested positive for COVID-19. Please refer to Part II, Item 7 of this report “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19” for additional information on this topic.
Finally, through the Rimini Street Foundation, which is privately funded by the Company, we encourage our employees to support humankind and share our company’s success by investing back into the communities we serve through in-kind donations, employee time and Company financial support.

As of December 31, 2021, we employed over 1,660 professionals globally. We also engage temporary employees and consultants as needed. None of our U.S. based employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Certain of our non-U.S. based employees are members of unions, works councils, trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in particular jurisdictions, as required by local labor laws. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good.
Technology Infrastructure and Operations
We have IT infrastructure and staff globally. Our operations support our client offerings, compliance requirements and future global expansion. To connect to systems owned, leased or otherwise controlled by our clients, we utilize site-to-site tunnels and virtual private networks with secure firewall administration underpinned with a high level of global network reliability, security and performance.
We maintain a formal and comprehensive information security management system, which is certified to ISO 27001: 2013. It is designed to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of client data, protect against security threats or data breaches, and prevent unauthorized access to the data of our customers. We strictly regulate and limit all access to our offices, have deployed advanced security software and hardware, and utilize advanced security measures.
Compliance and Certifications
ISO certifications are part of our commitment to developing and executing best-in-class processes to ensure our clients consistently receive exceptional service. We have achieved and maintain ISO 9001 and ISO 27001 certifications.
In 2010, we achieved ISO 9001 Quality Management System certification for “Third-party provider of enterprise software support services specifically on-boarding of client and client environments”. In 2011, we expanded our certification for “Provision of third-party enterprise software support services specifically on-boarding of client, building of client environments, worldwide tax and regulatory research and delivery of tax and regulatory updates”. In 2012, we expanded our certification for “Global provision of enterprise software support services, including client onboarding; client account management; product support for vendor delivered and client customized code; fix development and delivery; and research, development and delivery of worldwide tax, legal and regulatory updates”. The certification process verifies that detailed processes for relevant business areas are reviewed, continuously monitored and improved to ensure services and deliverables are consistently delivered with excellence. During 2018, the ISO standard was upgraded. Our current ISO 9001:2015 
-11-


certification was issued in December 2019 and is valid until December 2022. During this certification cycle, annual surveillance audits are conducted to validate ongoing compliance to the requirements.

In 2013, we achieved worldwide ISO 27001 information security certification for our support services. ISO 27001 is a security standard covering “The information security management system that supports the global provisioning of third-party software maintenance services”. Independent assessments of our conformity to the ISO 27001 standard includes evaluating security risks, designing and implementing comprehensive security controls and adopting an information security management process to meet security needs on an ongoing basis. Our current ISO 27001:2013 certification was issued in July 2019 and is valid until April 2022. During this certification cycle, annual surveillance audits are conducted to validate ongoing compliance to the requirements. 
Competition

We compete in the markets for enterprise software support products and services and management services. The support market has been dominated by the enterprise software vendors as the primary support providers for their own products. We believe the competitive service market with new independent competitors is still relatively undeveloped and maturing. As a result, we believe our primary competition today comes from the enterprise software vendors who license the products we service, such as IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. We expect that continued growth in our market could lead to significantly increased competition resulting from new entrants. In the meantime, our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of companies to engage an independent service vendor such as us to provide software maintenance and support services for their enterprise software.
The AMS market is dominated by large system integrators and consulting firms. In contrast to the support market, the AMS market is highly competitive and historically, price has been a significant factor in vendor selection. We expect this market to continue to be highly competitive. Our growth in management services will rely in part on our ability to differentiate the value and benefits of our fully integrated support and management solutions compared to current offerings or internal resources.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
•track record of technical capability to provide the required software support;
•ability to identify, develop and deliver required tax, legal and regulatory updates;
•infrastructure model to deliver support globally within guaranteed service levels;
•track record of providing a high level of client satisfaction;
•ease of support model onboarding, deployment and usage;
•breadth and depth of support functionality, including the ability to support customized software;
•cost of products and services;
•brand awareness and reputation;
•capability for delivering services in a secure, scalable and reliable manner;
•ability to innovate and respond to client needs rapidly; and
•size of referenceable client base.
We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. Our support management model allows us to gain an in-depth understanding of a given client’s unique software environment, enabling rapid and accurate responses to the client’s support requests. We provide our clients with comprehensive software support and management capabilities, including full support for add-ons and custom code as part of our services, something that, based on management’s experience and belief, enterprise software vendors typically do not provide with their standard support offering. We also offer our clients a relative discount to the fees they would otherwise pay their enterprise software vendor for their support services and enable them to avoid or defer undesired, costly upgrades. By eliminating unnecessary upgrades, additional resources to support customizations and providing savings on support fees, based on management’s experience, belief and estimates, our clients can save up to approximately 1.5 times their traditional vendor base support fees per year when using our base support services over a 10-year period. We have also invested significant resources developing our unique service methodologies and a data capture and management process to deliver comprehensive tax, legal and regulatory updates tailored for each client.
However, we believe some of our actual and potential competitors have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, greater name recognition and deeper customer relationships. Additionally, many software licensees are reluctant to engage a smaller independent company such as us to 
-12-


provide software maintenance and support services for their enterprise application software, choosing instead to continue relying on support services provided by their enterprise software vendor.
We expect competition and competitive pressure, both from new and existing competitors, to increase in the future.
Intellectual Property

We rely on federal, state, common law and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property consisting of a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names and patented technology. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties, such as service providers, vendors, individuals and entities that may be exploring a business relationship with us.
On December 17, 2019, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted Rimini Street its first patent, U.S. Patent No. 10,509,639 for the invention “Automatic Software-Update Framework”. On August 18, 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted Rimini Street its second patent, U.S. Patent No. 10,749,926 for the invention “Proxy for Modifying HTTP Messages to Comply with Browser,” and on November 23,2021, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted Rimini Street its third patent, U.S. Patent No. 11,182,707 for the invention "Case Assignment Advisor," which is a proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) based application. We currently have four patent applications pending in the United States. We own U.S. Patent No. 10,509,639 which will expire in August 2035, U.S. Patent No. 10,749,926 which will expire in September 2034, and U.S. Patent No. 11,182,707 which will expire in July 2039, as long as the patent maintenance fees are paid during the corresponding fee payment windows.
We maintain trademark registrations for the Rimini Street and Engineered for Support trademarks in the United States. We also maintain trademark registrations for Rimini Street in Canada, the European Union, China, Japan, India, Australia and certain other countries. Such registered trademarks will expire unless renewed at various times in the future. We have also applied for registration of Rimini Street as a trademark in certain other countries.
Policing unauthorized use of our processes and software tools and intellectual property rights is difficult. As of December 31, 2021, we are not aware of any breaches of our intellectual property rights.
