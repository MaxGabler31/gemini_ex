ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Universal, which was incorporated in 1994, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, manufacture and market semi-finished and finished specialty steel products, including stainless steel, nickel alloys, tool steel and certain other premium alloyed steels.  Our manufacturing process involves melting, remelting, heat treating, hot and cold rolling, forging, machining and cold drawing of semi-finished and finished specialty steels.  Our products are sold to service centers, forgers, rerollers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and wire redrawers.  Our customers further process our products for use in a variety of industries, including the aerospace, power generation, oil and gas, heavy equipment and general industrial markets.  We also perform conversion services on materials supplied by customers.
 We operate in four locations: Bridgeville and Titusville, Pennsylvania; Dunkirk, New York; and North Jackson, Ohio.  Our corporate headquarters is located at our Bridgeville location.  We operate these four manufacturing locations as one reportable business segment.
 We produce a wide variety of specialty steel grades using several manufacturing processes including argon oxygen decarburization (“AOD”), electro-slag remelted (“ESR”), vacuum induction melting (“VIM”) and vacuum-arc remelted (“VAR”).  At our Bridgeville and North Jackson facilities, we produce specialty steel products in the form of semi-finished and finished long products (ingots, blooms, billets and bars).  In addition, the Bridgeville facility produces flat rolled products (slabs and plates).  Semi-finished long products are primarily used by our Dunkirk facility and certain customers to produce finished bar, rod, and wire products.  Finished bar products that we manufacture are primarily used by OEMs and by service center customers for distribution to a variety of end users.  We also produce customized shapes primarily for OEMs that are cold rolled from purchased coiled strip, flat bar or extruded bar at our precision rolled products department, located at our Titusville facility.
 INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
 The specialty steel industry is a relatively small but distinct segment of the overall steel industry. Specialty steels include stainless steels, nickel alloys, tool steels, electrical steels, high-temperature alloys, magnetic alloys and electronic alloys.  Specialty steels are made with a high alloy content, suitable for use in environments that demand exceptional hardness, toughness, strength and resistance to heat, corrosion or abrasion, or combinations thereof.  Specialty steels generally must conform to more demanding customer specifications for consistency, straightness and surface finish than carbon steels.  For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 69% or more of our net sales were derived from stainless steel products.

We primarily manufacture our products within the following product lines and, generally, in response to customer orders:
 Stainless Steel.  Stainless steel, which represents the largest part of the specialty steel market, contains elements such as nickel, chrome and molybdenum that give it the unique qualities of high strength, good wear characteristics, natural attractiveness, ease of maintenance and resistance to corrosion and heat.  Stainless steel is used, among other applications, in the aerospace, oil and gas, power generation and automotive industries, as well as in the manufacturing of equipment for food handling, health and medical, chemical processing and pollution control.
 High-Strength Low Alloy Steel.  High-strength low alloy steel is a relative term that refers to those steels that maintain alloying elements that range in versatility.  The alloy elements of nickel, chrome and molybdenum in such steels typically exceeds the alloy element of carbon steels but not that of high-temperature alloy steel.  High-strength low alloy steels are manufactured for use generally in the aerospace industry.
 Tool Steel.  Tool steels contain elements of nickel, chrome and molybdenum to produce specific hardness characteristics that enable tool steels to form, cut, shape and shear other materials in the manufacturing process.  Heating and cooling at precise rates in the heat-treating process bring out these hardness characteristics.  Tool steels are utilized in the manufacturing of metals, plastics, paper and aluminum extrusions, pharmaceuticals, electronics and optics.
 High-Temperature Alloy Steel.  These steels are designed to meet critical requirements of heat resistance and structural integrity. They generally have very high nickel content relative to other types of specialty steels.  High-temperature alloy steels are manufactured for use generally in the aerospace industry.
 Our net sales by principal product line were as follows:

RAW MATERIALS
 We depend on the delivery of key raw materials for our day-to-day operations.  These key raw materials are carbon and stainless scrap metal and alloys, primarily consisting of nickel, chrome, molybdenum, and copper.  Scrap metal is primarily generated by industrial sources and is purchased through a number of scrap brokers and processors.  We also recycle scrap metal generated from our own production operations as a source of metal for our melt shops. Alloys are generally purchased from domestic agents and originate in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Russia, South America and South Africa.
 Our Bridgeville and North Jackson facilities currently supply semi-finished specialty steel products as starting materials to our other operating facilities.  Semi-finished specialty steel starting materials, which we cannot produce at a competitive cost, are purchased from other suppliers.  We generally purchase these starting materials from steel strip coil suppliers, extruders, flat rolled producers and service centers. We believe that adequate supplies of starting material will continue to be available.
 The cost of raw materials represents approximately 45% of the cost of products sold in 2017, and approximately 40% and 50%, respectively, of the cost of products sold in 2016 and 2015.  Raw material costs can be impacted by significant price changes.  Raw material prices vary based on numerous factors, including quality, and are subject to frequent market fluctuations.  Future raw material prices cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty.  We do not maintain any fixed-price long-term agreements with any of our raw material suppliers.

We maintain a sales price surcharge mechanism on certain of our products to match sales prices to raw material price changes.  For certain products, the surcharge is calculated at the time of order entry, based on current raw material prices or prices at the time of shipment.  For certain finished products, the surcharge is calculated based on the monthly average raw material prices two months prior to the promised ship date.
 CUSTOMERS
 Our largest customer in 2017, Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co., accounted for approximately 17%, 20% and 16% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.  International sales approximated 9% of 2017, 2016 and 2015 annual net sales.
BACKLOG
 Our backlog of orders (excluding surcharges) on hand as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $77.7 million compared to approximately $43.8 million at December 31, 2016.  We believe that this 77.4% increase in our backlog is largely a result of increased demand for our products due to an improved market and to a lesser extent market share gains.  Our backlog may not be indicative of actual sales because certain surcharges are not determinable until the order is shipped to the customer and, therefore, should not be used as a direct measure of future revenue.  However, we expect that our actual sales will be higher than the backlog once the actual surcharges are determined.
COMPETITION
 Competition in our markets is based upon product quality, delivery capability, customer service, customer approval and price. Maintaining high standards of product quality, while responding quickly to customer needs and keeping production costs at competitive levels, is essential to our ability to compete in these markets.
 We believe that there are several companies that manufacture one or more similar specialty steel products that are significant competitors.  There are a few smaller producing companies and material converters that are also considered to be competitors of ours.
 High import penetration of specialty steel products, especially stainless and tool steels, also impacts the competitive nature within the United States.  Unfair pricing practices by foreign producers have resulted in high import penetration into the U.S. markets in which we participate.
 EMPLOYEE RELATIONS
 We consider the maintenance of good relations with our employees to be important to the successful conduct of our business.  We have profit-sharing plans for certain salaried and hourly employees and for all of our employees represented by United Steelworkers (the “USW”) and have equity ownership programs for all of our eligible employees, in an effort to forge an alliance between our employees’ interests and those of our stockholders.  At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had 703, 645, and 634 employees, respectively, of which 564, 508, and 449, respectively, were USW members.  
Collective Bargaining Agreements
 Our Bridgeville, Titusville, Dunkirk and North Jackson facilities recognize the USW as the exclusive representative for their hourly employees with respect to the terms and conditions of their employment.  On March 4, 2016, the USW was certified as the exclusive bargaining representative for the hourly employees of our North Jackson facility.  The Company and the USW are currently negotiating the initial collective bargaining agreement for the North Jackson hourly employees.  The following collective bargaining agreements are currently in place:

Facility | Commencement Date | Expiration Date
------------+-------------------+----------------
Dunkirk | November 2017 | October 2022 
Bridgeville | September 2013 | August 2018 
Titusville | October 2015 | September 2020 

 
We believe a critical component of our collective bargaining agreements is the inclusion of a profit sharing plan.

Employee Benefit Plans
 We maintain a 401(k) retirement plan for our hourly and salaried employees. Pursuant to the 401(k) plan, participants may elect to make pre-tax and after-tax contributions, subject to certain limitations imposed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  In addition, we make periodic contributions to the 401(k) plan for the hourly employees employed at the Dunkirk and Titusville facilities, based on service, and at the North Jackson facility, based upon the employee’s age and wage rate.  We make periodic contributions for the salaried employees at all locations, except for North Jackson, based upon their service and their individual contribution to the 401(k) retirement plan.  For North Jackson salaried employees, we make periodic contributions based upon the employee’s age, annual salary, and their individual contributions.
 We participate in the Steelworkers Pension Trust (the “Trust”), a multi-employer defined-benefit pension plan that is open to all hourly and salaried employees associated with the Bridgeville facility.  We make periodic contributions to the Trust based on hours worked at a fixed rate for each hourly employee and a fixed monthly contribution on behalf of each salaried employee.
 We also provide group life and health insurance plans for our hourly and salary employees.
 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
 Under the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the “Plan”), the Company is authorized to issue up to 300,000 shares of common stock to its full-time employees, nearly all of whom are eligible to participate.  Under the terms of the Plan, employees can choose as of January 1 and July 1 of each year to have up to 10% of their total earnings withheld to purchase up to 100 shares of our common stock each six-month period.  The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of its beginning-of-the-period or end-of-the-period market prices.  At December 31, 2017, we have issued 212,089 shares of common stock since the Plan’s inception.
ENVIRONMENTAL
 We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations (collectively, “Environmental Laws”), including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, and the generation, handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances.  We monitor our compliance with applicable Environmental Laws and, accordingly, believe that we are currently in compliance with all laws and regulations in all material respects.  We are subject periodically to environmental compliance reviews by various regulatory offices. We may be liable for the remediation of contamination associated with generation, handling and disposal activities.  Environmental costs could be incurred, which may be significant, related to environmental compliance, at any time or from time to time in the future.
