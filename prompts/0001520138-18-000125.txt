ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated on December 19, 2014 in the State of Nevada. On October 17, 2017, we acquired Eqova Life Sciences, a Nevada corporation (“Eqova”). Eqova is a wholly-owned subsidiary through which we conduct our hemp oil product business.
 
Overview
 
With the acquisition of Eqova, we are transitioning away from our software services business and shifted our focus to a new line of business. Eqova is focused on the production and sale of hemp oil products through the medical practitioner market.
Eqova Life Sciences
 
On October 17, 2017, we acquired Eqova through an exchange of shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for all of the outstanding equity interest of Eqova. As part of the Exchange, we have brought on Eqova’s President and Director, Patrick Stiles, to serve as our President and Chief Executive Officer and as a Director on our Board of Directors.
 
Eqova is a medically-focused CBD company that develops clinical grade full spectrum hemp oil products, sold exclusively via partnerships with licensed medical practitioners to use with their patients. To date, we know of no other hemp oil company exclusively focused on the practitioner market, leaving it largely underserved. According to The Hemp Business Journal, the market for CBD products is projected to grow by 700% by 2020 with annual sales reaching $2.1 billion. With a head start in a growing marketplace, we believe that Eqova provides us with a prime growth opportunity with an established business.

Software Enterprise Platform Services
 
Our prior business, until recently discontinued, was providing software enterprise platform services. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold and marketed a cloud based software to detect advertising fraud on the internet. We had revenues of approximately $128,105 in the year ended December 31, 2017, 94% of which was for these software services and came from a single customer, Take5. In March 2018, we received the last payment from this customer. At this time, we have no customers for our software services and intend to discontinue this line of business as we shift our focus solely to sales of our hemp oil products.
The Market
 
Hemp Oil and CBD Market
 
Eqova and our hemp oil products are tailored primarily to the medical practitioner market. We believe this market is underserved and that other companies are unable to provide products that match the quality and consistent servings/dosage of our products.
CBD.co – The Online Hemp Oil Marketplace
 
We purchased the domain “CBD.co” in November of 2017. This website is an online marketplace for all types of hemp products, with the main focus on cannabidiol (CBD) products. Many online marketplaces do not allow CBD products on their platforms. CBD.co offers manufacturers and consumers of hemp oil products a one-stop destination to sell and buy a wide variety of hemp oil products. CBD.co will be a third-party marketplace for hemp oil products, allowing customers to buy products and leave reviews. We will seek to monetize the website through commissions on sales made on the site and advertising revenue.
Our Mission
 
Our mission for Eqova and our hemp oil products is to provide medical practitioners with superior products using standardized dosing and unique delivery methods.

Eqova's products are created using full spectrum hemp oil and other ingredients to achieve standardized dosing. These formulations combine the powerful benefits of cannabinoids in standardized products, which are intended to be distributed to patients under the care of licensed health practitioners. All Eqova products are carefully researched. We require our manufacturers to make our products in cGMP-compliant labs located in the United States.
 
Since the beginning of Eqova and this business in October 2017 through December 31, 2017, sales of our hemp oil products produced revenues of $7,605.
 
Patents and Intellectual Property Rights
 
We have not filed for any intellectual property protection. However, we rely on intellectual property law that may include a combination of copyright, trade secret and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property. Our employees and independent contractors will be required to sign agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any ownership that they may claim in those works. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without consent intellectual property that we own. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.

From time to time, we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. While we believe that our product and service offerings do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party, we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute. If we do not prevail in such disputes, we may lose some or all of our intellectual property protection, be enjoined from further sales of the applications determined to infringe the rights of others, and/or be forced to pay substantial royalties to a third party.
 
Governmental Controls, Approval and Licensing Requirements
 
Hemp Oil Products
 
A major obstacle to our growth is the public perception that hemp and marijuana are the same thing. This perception drives much of the regulation of hemp products. Although hemp and marijuana are both part of the cannabis family, they differ in cultivation, function, and application. Despite the use of marijuana becoming more widely legalized, it is viewed by many regulators and many others as an illegal product. Hemp, on the other hand, is used in a variety of other ways that include clothing, skin products, pet products, dietary supplements (the use of CBD oil), and thousands of other applications. Hemp may be legally sold, however the inability of many to understand the difference between hemp and marijuana often causes burdensome regulation and confusion among potential customers. Therefore, we are affected by laws related to cannabis and marijuana, even though our products are not the direct targets of these laws.
 
Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substance Act (“CSA”) and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession and/or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) describes Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA in Colorado with respect to state-regulated cannabis activities in Colorado and other states, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
Notwithstanding the CSA, 29 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Guam and Puerto Rico allow their residents to use medical cannabis. The states of Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont (effective July 1, 2018) and Washington, and the District of Columbia, allow cannabis for adult recreational use. Such state and territorial laws are in conflict with the federal CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal at the federal level.

In light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. For example, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration, James M. Cole, issued a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) provided guidelines (the “FinCEN Guidelines”) on February 14, 2014, regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) obligations.
 
Additional existing and pending legislation provides, or seeks to provide, protection to persons acting in violation of federal law but in compliance with state laws regarding cannabis. The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment (formerly known as the Rohrbacher-Farr Amendment) to the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, which funds the DOJ, since 2014 has prohibited the DOJ from using funds to prevent states with laws authorizing the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical cannabis from implementing such laws. On August 2016, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in United States v. McIntosh that the Amendment bars the DOJ from spending funds on the prosecution of conduct that is allowed by state medical cannabis laws, provided that such conduct is in strict compliance with applicable state law. The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment is currently effective through September 30, 2018, but as an amendment to an appropriations bill, it must be renewed annually.
 
These developments previously were met with a certain amount of optimism in the cannabis industry, but (i) neither the CARERS Act nor the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2017 have yet been adopted, (ii) the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, being an amendment to an appropriations bill that must be renewed annually, has not currently been renewed beyond September 30, 2018, and (iii) the ruling in United States v. McIntosh is only applicable precedent in the Ninth Circuit.
 
Because of the discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from federal law that prohibits any such activities, DOJ Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued the Cole Memo concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA.

At the time of its issuance, the Cole Memo reiterated Congress’s determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of cannabis is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo noted that the DOJ was committed to enforcement of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also noted that the DOJ was committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provided guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities (the “Enforcement Priorities”) in preventing:
 

· | the distribution of cannabis to minors;
--+----------------------------------------


· | revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cannabis possession or use on federal property.
--+------------------------------------------------

 
However, on January 4, 2018, the U.S. Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, issued a memorandum for all U.S. Attorneys (the “Sessions Memo”) stating that the Cole Memo was rescinded effective immediately. In particular, Mr. Sessions stated that “prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions,” which require “federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.” The Sessions Memo went on to state that given the DOJ’s well-established general principles, “previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately.”

It is unclear at this time whether the Sessions Memo indicates that the Trump administration will strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement. However, a significant change in the federal government’s enforcement policy with respect to current federal laws applicable to cannabis could cause significant financial damage to us. We do not currently cultivate, distribute or sell cannabis, but our hemp oil products are closely tied to the cannabis industry.
 
Although the Sessions Memo has rescinded the Cole Memo and it is unclear at this time what the ultimate impact of that rescission will have on our business, if any, we intend to continue to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in and ensure that our activities do not interfere with any of the Enforcement Priorities set forth in the Cole Memo.
 
Competition
 
Hemp Oil Products
 
Currently, we face competition from a number of other companies providing hemp-based products. We expect that many other companies will recognize the market potential of hemp products and enter into the marketplace as competitors. As states continue to legalize marijuana and the public gains a better understanding of hemp products, we expect many new companies will enter into the hemp business in the near future.
 
There are many wholesalers and retailers of CBD oil. However, we believe we can continue to distinguish ourselves by targeting the medical practitioner market and providing high-quality products with consistently reliable dosage.
 
Employees
 
As of the date hereof, we do not have any employees other than our officers and directors and one employee. Our officers and directors will continue to work for us for the foreseeable future. We anticipate hiring appropriate personnel on an as-needed basis, and utilizing the services of independent contractors as needed.
