Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a pioneering clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on harnessing the power of the innate immune system by using the natural killer cell to treat cancer, infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases. Natural killer, or NK, cells are the body’s first line of defense due to their innate ability to rapidly seek and destroy abnormal cells, such as cancer or virally-infected cells, without prior exposure or activation by other support molecules required to activate adaptive immune cells such as T-cells.
 We believe that our proprietary NK cell line, coupled with our planned integrated discovery ecosystem, positions us to implement precision cancer medicine by leveraging the advances that have evolved during the past decade and addressing newly discovered challenges of cancer. Cancer is only recently understood to be a complex of rare diseases, with hundreds of patient-specific, cancer-promoting mutated proteins, some known and many more unknown called neoepitopes. Identifying and targeting these mutated proteins is our strategy to overcome the challenges of cancer in the era of genomics, transcriptomics and immuno-oncology. We believe neoepitopes, which are newly discovered antigens, selectively expressed on the cancer cells and not on the essential normal tissue, represent large untapped targeting opportunities for immune effector cells such as our activated NK cells.
 Multiple Modes of Tumor Cell Killing. Our immuno-oncology NK platform has multiple modes to potentially induce cell death against the tumor or infected cell by: (1) direct killing by binding to stress ligands expressed by the diseased cell with the release of toxic granules directly into the tumor cell; (2) antibody mediated killing by binding to antibodies, that are either produced in the body or in response to vaccination or administered as monoclonal antibody products in combination, and enhancing their cancer killing effect, enabling targeted cell killing through antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or ADCC; and (3) direct targeted killing by binding to known or newly discovered tumor-specific antigens expressed on the surface of tumor cells and inducing cell death by the release of toxic granules directly into the tumor cell and by the release of cytokines and chemokines which recruit additional innate and adaptive immune responses, including the recruitment of cytotoxic T-cells.
 Our targeted therapeutic areas include: (1) cancer, focusing on solid tumors, hematological malignancies as well as residual disease such as cancer stem cells, (2) infectious diseases, including viral and other opportunistic pathogens, and (3) inflammatory diseases, ranging from rare inherited diseases to more prevalent autoimmune disorders.

The NANT Cancer Vaccine.  The NANT Cancer Vaccine, or NCV, Program is a personalized therapy that utilizes our off-the-shelf natural killer cells as the backbone of the therapy.  NCV consists of an initial tumor conditioning regimen followed by a molecularly-informed immunologic conditioning therapy.  More specifically, NCV combines tumor genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data derived from our affiliate entity NantOmics’ genomic sequencing and proteomic analysis services with the novel delivery of metronomic, albumin bound low-dose chemotherapy in conjunction with certain other agents, followed by a sequenced administration of tumor-associated antigen vaccines and IL-15, all of which potentiate our NK cell therapy to drive immunogenic cell death while avoiding the ravages of toxic high dose chemotherapy. By inducing immunogenic cell death and enhancing a patient’s innate and adaptive immune system, NCV is designed to attain a long-term, durable response in multiple cancer types with a potential for lower toxicity and improved efficacy in comparison with current standards of care. We believe that employing our NK cell therapy in the context of NCV would biologically be a more effective combination for long term success over available standards of care that employ maximum tolerated dose, tolerogenic cell death and immune system compromise.
 Our Integrated Discovery Ecosystem for Precision Medicine. In order to effectively target newly discovered neoepitopes, we plan to integrate the following ecosystem to help drive the utility of our NK cell therapies against these cancer-promoting mutated proteins, including the use of our genetically modified NK cells that express the high-affinity CD16 receptor, or haNK, in conjunction with cancer vaccines that induce in vivo antibody formation directed against these mutated proteins as well as the development of NK cells modified to directly target these mutated proteins: (1) a high-speed supercomputing infrastructure to help identify both known antigens on the surface of tumor cells and neoepitopes in clinical patients suffering from cancer, in a timely manner and at large scale; (2) a next-generation genomic and transcriptomic sequencing infrastructure to identify the expression of the neoepitopes on the surface of the tumor cell, developed by NantOmics; (3) delivering an antigenic neoepitope via an adenoviral or yeast platform developed by an affiliate entity to induce IgG1 in vivo production and enhanced ADCC activity by our haNK therapy; (4) a diverse library of human antibodies from which to interrogate and extract an antibody matching the neoepitope; and (5)  haNK and chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, targeted Natural Killer, or taNK, cells potentially capable of being produced as a scalable cell-based “off-the-shelf” therapy without the need for patient compatibility matching. We expect to regularly add newly discovered neoepitopes from our discovery engine, and we believe the thousands of newly discovered antigens selectively expressed on the cancer cells and not on the essential normal tissue will provide us with the ability to create new and targeted libraries of antibodies to be potentially delivered as living drugs for metastatic cancer cells and cancer stem cells.
 Innate Killing: aNK Platform. We have developed a unique NK cell which we believe is capable of being produced as a cell-based “off-the-shelf” therapy that can be molecularly engineered in a variety of ways to impart enhanced killing potential for cancer and virally-infected cells. Unlike normal NK cells, our NK cells do not express inhibitory receptors, which diseased cells often utilize to turn off the killing function of NK cells. We have developed a unique activated NK, or aNK, cell which lacks these inhibitory receptors but retains activation receptors that enable selective innate targeting and killing of stressed diseased cells. They do so through an array of naturally occurring activation receptors that bind to stress proteins that are overexpressed on the surfaces of cells under stress such as cancerous and virally infected cells.  These killing mechanisms are preserved in our aNK cells and are increased compared to normal NK cells by virtue of delivering a larger payload of lytic enzymes and cytokines responsible for the direct and indirect killing of diseased cells. We believe our aNK cells can be grown at commercial scale as a living drug using our proprietary manufacturing and distribution processes.
 Several phase I safety studies with aNK cells have concluded in a variety of bulky hematological cancers and solid tumors, enrolling 46 patients, with demonstrated safety at all doses studied and encouraging evidence of single-agent activity and a durable remission, including complete responses in liquid tumors. Based on these clinical trials, we are developing the therapeutic applications of this aNK platform through molecular engineering designed to leverage additional modes of killing available to aNKs, including antibody mediated killing- the haNK platform, antigen targeted killing- the taNK platform, and both antibody mediated and antigen targeted killing- the t-haNK platform, all described below.

Antibody Mediated Killing- the haNK Platform. We have genetically engineered our aNK cells to overexpress high-affinity CD16 receptors, which bind to antibodies. These high-affinity NK, or haNK, cells are designed to directly bind to antibodies, such as Herceptin, Erbitux and Rituxan with the intent to enhance the cancer killing effect of these therapeutic antibodies by facilitating targeted cell killing through ADCC. Antibodies are prevalently used to treat cancer and generate over $50.0 billion in reported annual sales. Several studies have suggested long term response to these antibodies correlates with a patient’s NK cells expressing the high affinity CD16 receptor.  We believe, based on currently available literature, that only approximately 10% to 15% of the addressable patient population eligible for antibody therapies carry high-affinity CD16 receptors. This implies that our haNK product candidate may have significant market potential as a combination therapy to potentially address a large number of patients, including at earlier stages of cancer therapy, who have poor responses to antibody products. We therefore intend to develop our haNK product candidate as combination therapies with widely-used Federal Drug Administration, or FDA, approved antibody products such as avelumab, rituximab, cetuximab and trastuzumab.  Furthermore, we are currently initiating numerous combination therapy trials utilizing an IL-15 super-agonist, that has been the subject of several studies at the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, as well as adenoviral and yeast vaccine platforms developed by affiliate entities to deliver known tumor associated antigens as well as neoepitopes to induce in vivo production of IgG1 and maximize ADCC killing utilizing our haNK product. Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, master and working cell banks of this product have been successfully established earlier in 2017 and will serve as our source for product for our clinical trials and commercialization going forward.  We have optimized our haNK product manufacturing process partly through the successful development of a product that does not require IL-2 supplementation, thereby overcoming a technically challenging and costly limitation that many other NK cell based therapies face. We have also successfully established a process for cryopreservation and long term storage of final dose forms, thereby optimizing production efficiencies and allowing for on-demand availability and minimal handling at the infusion sites. Cryopreserved haNK is now approved for use in 12 phase Ib/II clinical trials. 
 Antigen Targeted Killing- the taNK Platform. We have genetically engineered our aNK platform to express CARs to target specific antigens on the surface of abnormal cells. These taNK cells are designed to directly bind to tumor-specific antigens in both solid and hematological cancers and induce cell death by the release of toxic granules directly into the tumor cell and by the release of cytokines and chemokines which recruit additional innate and adaptive immune responses, including the recruitment of cytotoxic T-cells. These tumor-specific antigens can be divided into the following four classes, which can be targeted by our taNK platform: (1) checkpoint inhibitors expressed on the surface of tumor cells such as PD-L1; (2) well-established tumor surface antigens such as HER2 and CD19; (3) newly discovered neoepitopes; and (4) novel surface receptors associated with cancer stem cells.  We believe taNK cell activation through the binding of its CAR receptors to cancer specific proteins is potent enough to overcome many inhibitory signals and immunosuppressive factors present in the tumor microenvironment. In the last 6 months our HER2.taNK product has passed several regulatory milestones in Europe, including the initiation and dosing of the first patient in a phase I clinical trial for HER2-positive glioblastoma, and plans for our U.S. phase I clinical trial in Her2-positive solid tumors are well underway. 
 Antibody Mediated and Antigen Targeted Killing- the t-haNK Platform. Our newest line of products are an innovative combination of our haNK and taNK platforms in a single genetic engineering that incorporates all the features of our haNK platform together with a CAR. The resulting line of products under this platform avails itself to all three modes of killing: innate, antibody mediated and targeted killing. Such products are intended to be combined with therapeutic antibodies to effectively target either two different epitopes of the same cancer specific protein or two different cancer specific proteins. CD19.t-haNK is our lead product among a growing list of product candidates in this pipeline and has demonstrated excellent activity in all three modes of killing in in vitro testing. Combining our CD19.t-haNK with rituximab allows for targeting of both CD19 and CD20 proteins that may be expressed on the same cancer cell and maintains its importance should the cancer be driven to stop expressing one of them. We are currently planning our first in human CD19.t-haNK trial that will be followed immediately by a phase Ib/II combination trial with the NCV.
 Potential Advantages of our aNK Platform over T-Cell and Other Current Immunotherapies
 The immune system has two components: innate immune cells, such as NK cells, which are always switched on to attack diseased cells, and adaptive immune cells, such as T-cells, which are mobilized to mount a delayed response. Our proprietary aNK platform is specifically designed to potentially address many of the limitations associated with current adaptive autologous cellular immunotherapies. We believe key limitations of adaptive autologous immunotherapy are the need to retrieve non-compromised active T-cells from a cancer patient in a procedure called leukapheresis and the requirement for a complex and costly manufacturing process to develop the therapy. As a consequence of this need to harvest sufficient quantities of active T-cells, current autologous CAR-T cell therapies, in large part, are limited to patients from highly selected, earlier-stage hematological cancers and leave many patients ineligible for treatment.  Additionally, patients must undergo lymohodepleting chemotherapy prior to receiving CAR-T therapy and rely on engraftment, thereby exposing themselves to life-threatening serious adverse events for extended periods.  In contrast, our allogeneic, “off-the-shelf” NK cells do not rely on the patient as the source of suitable immune cells for processing, thereby availing every cancer patient as a potential candidate for treatment. In addition, our NK cell therapy is intended to be paired with immune potentiating agents, rather than immunodepleting agents, to drive a long-lasting adaptive immune response.

• | Innate immune response. aNK platform products are always activated and can naturally detect and rapidly destroy a wide variety of diseased cells without prior exposure to antigens or activation by stimulatory molecules. In contrast, the adaptive immune system requires co-stimulation for activation and clonal expansion, resulting in delayed killing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Promotion of adaptive immune response. aNK platform products stimulate the adaptive component of the immune system by producing chemokines and other molecules that activate and recruit adaptive immune cells, including T-cells, to attack the diseased cells.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhancement of ADCC effect with CD16 expressing haNK cells. Our haNK product candidates may have significant market potential as a combination therapy with approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting tumor associated antigens as well as neoepitope induced antibodies, potentially addressing a large number of patients who have poor responses to antibody products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wide therapeutic potential across multiple tumor types and even late-stage disease. In preclinical studies and phase I safety clinical trials to date, aNK cells have demonstrated activity in a spectrum of cancers, including bulky hematological cancers and solid tumors, including late-stage cancer patients who have failed multiple rounds of chemotherapy, radiation and stem cell transplantation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to attack cancer stem cells. aNK cells have been shown in preclinical studies to attack cancer stem cells, which have proven resistant to conventional chemotherapy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Application in diseases beyond cancer. We believe aNK platform products have the potential to treat diseases beyond cancer such as infectious and inflammatory diseases because of the inherent ability of NK cells to kill virally infected and abnormal cells. Preclinical studies in HIV and Ebola viruses demonstrate this capability.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well tolerated. aNK cells are hypo-immunogenic and have shown no dose limiting toxicities in over 46 patients who have received therapy to date, even when some patients received as many as 18 infusions of aNK cells over six months. In contrast, clinical trials of CAR-T cell therapy have experienced challenges, such as reports of severe adverse toxicities of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity in numerous patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of administration. aNK platform products may be administrable in outpatient facilities, offering physicians the flexibility to re-dose therapy in the ambulatory setting for extended periods and in large practices. In contrast, CAR-T cell therapy is a complex and costly procedure limited to select certified centers, at times require hospitalization and intensive care unit admission following severe adverse toxicities associated with cytokine release syndrome.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Virtually universal patient compatibility. aNK platform products do not require patient-donor matching or a minimum level of patient immuno-competence.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low-cost, efficient and scalable manufacturing. aNK, haNK, taNK and t-haNK cells have the potential to be expanded on a large scale and readily supplied on demand from what we believe is the world’s only GMP compliant aNK cell bank, a proprietary asset of our company.

Experienced Management Team
 Since the founding of our company in 2002, we have assembled a team of proven, experienced and visionary leaders in biotechnology. Our team is led by Patrick Soon-Shiong, M.D., FRCS (C), FACS, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, or  CEO. Dr. Soon-Shiong was first introduced to us in 2007 when our technology was at a very early stage of development and he provided us with advice and scientific development strategies, including demonstration of activity in the clinical setting following irradiation of the cells and demonstration of safety and activity following multiple infusions in patients with both end-stage solid and liquid tumors. Dr. Soon-Shiong made an equity investment in our company in December 2014 and joined as our Chief Medical Officer in January 2015 and became our Chairman and CEO in March 2015. Dr. Soon-Shiong, a renowned surgeon and scientist, has pioneered novel therapies for both diabetes and cancer, published over 100 scientific papers in the United States, and was issued over 230 worldwide patents on groundbreaking advancements spanning a myriad of fields. He performed the first encapsulated islet stem cell transplant in a diabetic patient in the United States. He invented, developed and launched the first nanoparticle delivery system of human albumin, Abraxane. Dr. Soon-Shiong was founder, Chairman and CEO of American Pharmaceutical Partners (sold to Fresenius SE for approximately $4.6 billion in 2008), Abraxis BioScience (sold to Celgene Corporation for approximately $3.8 billion in 2010) and NantWorks, an ecosystem of companies to create a transformative global health information and next generation pharmaceutical development network.

Since 2015, the company recruited seasoned executives to lead manufacturing, clinical development, regulatory affairs, medical affairs, quality and other critical staff and continues to build the management and manufacturing infrastructure. 
 Company Vision 
 Our vision is to be the premier immunotherapy company, harnessing the power of the innate immune system with the NK cell at the core, to pioneer precision medicine in the treatment of cancer, infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases. 
Our Core Strategies
 Our goal of becoming the world leader in immunotherapy for cancers and other diseases can be realized through a major realignment of how we apply the collective knowledge amassed in this field to date. This starts with precisely determining the ‘molecular address’ of the target disease and leveraging this knowledge in the methodical selection and staging of both tumor and immune conditioning agents, in accordance with the natural order of biology. Metronomic, low doses of certain agents would be employed to potentiate cellular stress, while an array of other agents would be applied selectively and sequentially to propagate a meaningful and lasting adaptive immune response. We believe that by utilizing the NK cell as the backbone and central coordinator as we engage and sequentially orchestrate the entire ecosystem of immune cells, we can effectively empower the patient’s own immune system to regain control by becoming its own ‘drug factory’ that can establish and once again maintain a cancer-free in vivo environment.  The key elements of our strategy include:
  
• | Pursuit of both accelerated regulatory pathways and large market opportunities. We will pursue a comprehensive clinical development plan designed to maximize the commercial potential of our aNK platform and the role of innate immunotherapy as the backbone in the treatment of cancer in combination with chemo and immunotherapies, radiation and surgery. We intend to pursue accelerated regulatory approval pathways and seek indications that can lead to orphan drug status and breakthrough therapy designation, as well as pursue large market opportunities in a wide range of solid tumors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Application of our aNK platform product candidates. In the natural order of biology, the NK cell acts as the first line of defense in our bodies in recognizing and clearing mutated or transformed cancerous cells and virally-hijacked cells. Because NK cells play a pivotal role in recruiting and engaging the body’s natural vaccine-inducing cells, the dendritic and subsequently B and T-cells, as a result of its direct engagement with abnormal cells, bypassing this critical immune step with downstream therapies run a potentially insurmountable risk of relying on a narrow range of immune mechanisms that will ultimately fail in the patient as the tumor is forced into escaping a targeted intervention. The result is resistant metastatic disease in patients with persistent immune system gaps due to artificially bypassing these critical immune steps. By reinstituting this innate pathway with our aNK platform products in the context of sequential immunotherapy following the inducement of an immunogenic hot tumor, we believe we can induce long term immunity and durable responses.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | haNK. We are leveraging the highly versatile nature of our haNK product candidate to target the large addressable market of already approved monoclonal antibodies, such as Herceptin, Erbitux and Rituxan, in the treatment of a wide range of cancers. Antibody products play a central role across many cancer indications and generate over $50.0 billion in global annual sales. We believe, based on currently available literature, that only approximately 10% to 15% of the patient population eligible for antibody therapy carry high-affinity CD16 receptors. We expect to address the approximately 85% to 90% of patients who are receiving these antibodies but have either unsatisfactory responses or developed resistance and may benefit from our high-affinity CD16 haNK cells administered in combination with one or more of these therapeutic antibodies. In 2017, the FDA granted us regulatory clearance for the first in human study for haNK and we quickly demonstrated that this product can be safely administered in cancer patients. Subsequently in 2017, we filed multiple investigational new drug, or IND, submissions to the FDA for clinical trials with our cryopreserved haNK product candidate in combination with different monoclonal antibodies as well as combinations with our NCV products, developed by affiliate entities, to drive in vivo IgG1 production and enhance NK activity. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | taNK. We will apply a variety of CAR targeted taNK product candidates to address cancers with well-established tumor surface antigens, such as HER2, EGFR and CD20 in addition to targeting checkpoint ligands such as PD-L1. Because of its ability to overcome inhibitory signaling commonly found in the tumor microenvironment and can kill solid tumor targets without CD80/86 co-activation signaling, we believe our taNK product candidates will have a highly valuable role in treating patients with bulky hematological malignancies and solid tumors. In 2017, the European regulatory agency granted authorization for the first in human phase I trial for HER2.taNK cells for patients with recurrent glioblastoma. The first patient was subsequently dosed with no reported adverse events. HER2.taNK cells will soon be studied in combination with NCV agents in phase I/II trials in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and other malignancies. Additional targeted taNK products are currently in development for a variety of cancers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | t-haNK. One of the more recently anticipated and versatile of our platform programs is t-haNK, a class of products capable of all three mechanisms for target killing- innate, antibody mediated and targeted killing. Aside from its natural, unassisted killing ability, it can target two distinct cancer antigens at once - one mediated through an antibody such as rituximab to bind CD20 and the other through a CAR receptor, such as a CD19 receptor. In addition to expressing CD16 receptors, these products are IL-2 growth independent and can express a functional enhancer such as IL-12 or chemokine receptors. CD19.t-haNK is currently in human enabling studies and plans for the first phase I/II lymphoma trial are under way. Subsequent t-haNK products include CD33, CD123, FLT3, PDL1, EGFR and CSPG4.t-haNKs and will be developed in a variety of cancer settings.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our integrated discovery engine to discover neoepitopes. Through our strategic collaborations with our affiliate companies at NantWorks, we plan to identify both known antigens on the surface of patient tumor cells and identify the surface expression of neoepitopes from clinical samples and interrogate antibody libraries to identify antibodies that bind to corresponding neoepitopes. Through this cohesive and expansive discovery engine, we can further drive the development of a novel product candidate pipeline, thereby establishing a new category of ‘just-in-time’ precision medicine therapies. We expect to regularly add newly discovered neoepitopes from our discovery engine. We believe the thousands of newly discovered antigens, selectively expressed on the cancer cells and not on the essential normal tissue, will provide us with the ability to create new and targeted libraries of antibodies to be potentially delivered as living drugs for metastatic cancer cells and cancer stem cells.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue opportunities with vaccine and cytokine combination partnerships that drive in vivo production of anti-cancer antibodies for ADCC killing with haNK and t-haNK cells. We plan to enroll patients into a wide range of combination therapy studies that employ adenoviral and yeast vaccine platforms together with a novel IL-15 cytokine agonist to deliver tumor associated antigens and neoepitope antigens that induce in vivo production of IgG1, and when combined with our haNK and t-haNK cells, maximize both ADCC killing and adaptive immune responses. We have evolved our haNK and t-haNK platforms to be IL-2 growth independent, which has substantial commercial advantages.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue opportunities with pharmaceutical companies for commercially approved antibodies and select late-stage antibodies in development. Numerous biopharmaceutical companies have previously licensed our haNK cells for non-therapeutic applications that facilitate the selection and validation of their antibody candidates for development. A growing number of these biopharmaceutical companies have also licensed our haNK cells for a lot release quality-control testing for their clinical-grade antibody products. We plan to leverage these biopharmaceutical business relationships to forge therapeutic collaborations to conduct clinical studies with our haNK and t-haNK product candidates in combination with their late-stage and commercial antibody products in order to demonstrate the combined enhanced killing capabilities in the greater than 85% of patients that lack high-affinity CD16 expression. We believe this potential for enhanced efficacy provides a rationale for studying haNK combinations with these new antibodies, whether during the development phase or after commercial launch by the biopharmaceutical companies. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Accelerate clinical development of haNK, taNK and t-haNK by entering into phase Ib/II and registration trials with our product candidates in combination with marketed drugs and select late-stage product candidates. A large number of monoclonal antibodies and chemotherapy drugs are being marketed for multiple indications. Published data show these antibodies generally have enhanced activity in patients with high-affinity NK cells. Published data also show that chemotherapy agents such as 5FU, cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel, when administered in low doses, condition the tumors to become immunogenically active and more readily recognizable to the immune system. We plan to accelerate clinical development of our aNK platform product candidates by initiating company-sponsored phase Ib/II and registration trials in combination with commercially approved and select late-stage antibodies and immunotherapies together with select approved chemotherapy agents administered at low-doses. We believe this approach will accelerate the development and potential commercialization of our product pipeline. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish low-cost, scalable manufacturing capabilities to support late-stage clinical trials and global commercialization. We believe our aNK platform products offer unique advantages of a simplified, on-demand manufacturing process that is relatively easy to scale and requires minimal handling at the site of infusion. We have opened our pilot production facility, which can supply clinical product for our phase Ib/II haNK and taNK clinical trials. We are also completing a state-of-the-art, cell-based manufacturing facility which will have the capacity to support large-scale clinical trials and commercialization. We are developing novel manufacturing methods, including equipment utilizing state-of-the-art optics and proprietary media, designed to maximize the attributes of our NK platform. We also implemented proprietary cryopreservation methods that enable large scale production yields to be frozen down into final dose forms for easy storage and shipping on demand. Cryopreservation allows for significant cost efficiencies and the establishment of commercial scale pipeline supply.

• | Extend our NK platform to address diseases beyond cancer. We believe our aNK platform has the potential to address diseases beyond cancer such as viral infectious and inflammatory diseases because of the inherent role of NK cells in recognizing and killing virally infected cells and modulating inflammatory responses. Preclinical studies in Ebola virus demonstrate this capability. Efforts are underway to evaluate the role of the aNK platform in clearing HIV reservoirs as well as other applications in the infectious disease setting. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our aNK Platform as the Foundation for our haNK, taNK and t-haNK Product Candidates. 
Based on the unique characteristics of our aNK cells described above, we are aiming to expand the potential therapeutic applications of our aNK platform through molecular engineering of our aNK cells designed to leverage the multiple modes of killing available to aNK cells, including innate and antibody mediated killing- the haNK platform, innate and antigen targeted killing- the taNK platform, and a combination of all three- the t-haNK platform, as illustrated below.
 

8

Antibody Mediated Killing- the haNK Platform. We have genetically engineered our aNK cells to both overexpress high-affinity CD16 receptors and express the IL-2 cytokine. These haNK cells are well suited to directly bind to concurrently administered antibodies such as Herceptin, Erbitux and Rituxan to potentially enhance their targeted cancer killing effects through ADCC, as illustrated below.
 

9

Target Activated Killing- the taNK Platform. We have genetically modified our aNK cells to incorporate CAR to target specific antigens on the surface of abnormal cells. These taNK cells are designed to directly bind to tumor-specific antigens in a variety of bulky hematological cancers and solid tumors and induce cell death through the release of toxic granules directly into the tumor cell and the release of cytokines and chemokines which recruit additional innate and adaptive immune responses including the recruitment of cytotoxic T-cells. These tumor-specific antigens targetable by our taNK platform can be divided into the four aforementioned classes: (1) checkpoint inhibitors expressed on the surface of tumor cells such as PD-L1; (2) well-established tumor surface antigens such as HER2 and CD19; (3) neoepitopes; and (4) novel surface receptors associated with cancer stem cells, as illustrated below.
 

10

Target Activated and Antibody Mediated Killing- the t-haNK Platform. We have genetically engineered our aNK cells to avail itself to all three mechanisms of killing through the use of both tricistronic and quadcistronic insertions, thereby imparting CAR targeted killing via cancer specific antigens, ADCC based killing as mediated by antibody products, innate killing inherent to NK cells, as well as independence from IL-2 supplementation for expansion and viability and a functional enhancer such as an activating cytokine or intensified trafficking ability.  Based on this unique arrangement, t-haNK cells can target two distinct cancer antigens at once- one via its CD16 receptor and an antibody such as rituximab (CD20) and the other through its CAR receptor (i.e. CD19), as illustrated below.
 

11

Leveraging Our Assets. We plan to advance clinical candidates from each of these aNK platform types as part of a multifaceted and comprehensively orchestrated tumor and immune-conditioning regimen, collectively known as the NCV regimen. As of the date of this filing, we are proceeding with over 12 Company sponsored INDs with more planned for this year. 
 

aNK Clinical Safety & Activity as the Foundation for our haNK, taNK and t-haNK Programs 
 Safety Experience with our aNK Platform in Phase I Clinical Trials. Our aNK platform has been evaluated for clinical safety in 46 patients across four phase I clinical trials. Unlike many cell-based adaptive immunotherapy trials, patients were not pre-selected based on the likelihood of response to the intervention, but rather we accepted all-comers with very advanced disease, having failed multiple rounds of standard chemotherapy, radiation, surgery and even stem cell transplantation.  Additionally, unlike as seen with most other cell-based trials, none of these patients received lympho-depleting or pre-conditioning agents in order to enhance therapeutic effects. 
 Across all studies, we demonstrated that our product was well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities including in patients who received individual doses of aNK cells as high as 1x1010 cells/m2, as many as 18 infusions over a six-month period and a cumulative dose as much as 15x1010 cells. Although aNK is not intended as a monotherapy, early signals of single-agent activity, including partial, mixed and complete responses and stable disease were recorded in all four trials.  See figure above.

Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto
 
Twelve patients with relapsed/refractory hematological malignancies who relapsed after undergoing stem cell transplantation were enrolled in this dose escalation study with aNK monotherapy. The number of cycles of aNK administered ranged from 1-6 with minimal and infrequent toxicities being reported. Some patients experienced grade I fever, chills, fatigue, blurry vision and nausea, with only one grade II toxicity event (fever & chills), which occurred during an aNK infusion. Several patients were reported to have clinical responses to aNK monotherapy in the first two dose groups as follows: Patient#1- Mixed Response, #3- Durable Complete Remission, #5- Clinical Improvement in Symptoms, #6- Mixed Response, and #11- Durable Complete Remission.  See figure above.

Cytokine release was not triggered by aNK infusions in a subset of evaluated patients, though a transient rise in TNF-β for patient #3 was noted above (Figure 2).
 University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh
 
In this study of advanced AML, only one patient has reported product related adverse event with grade 2 fever and chills that were responsive to supportive care. Clinical activity included blast parentage reductions or stabilization.  See figure above.
 14

RUSH University Medical Center, Chicago
 
In this study which enrolled patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, or RCC, and melanoma who failed standard therapy including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, adverse events were infrequent and limited to grade I/II with the exception of a single grade III fever that responded to supportive care and one case of a single grade IV hypoglycemia in a patient with extensive liver metastasis and tumor lysis that likewise responded immediately to supportive care. With respect to this single-agent, single-course study, stable disease and partial responses were observed in five out of 11 patients who received doses ranging from 1x108 to 1x109 aNK cells and a clinical response was also noted in an advanced melanoma patient. See figure above. 

15

Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt
 
In another study that primarily enrolled patients with advanced, refractory solid tumors, no product related toxicities were reported and encouraging responses were seen in patients with lung cancer who failed surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, with three out of four patients demonstrating partial response or stable disease.  See figure above.

Non-Clinical Validation of haNK, a Compelling Case for haNK-based Therapies 
 haNK as the Current ‘Gold-Standard’ in Non-Clinical Characterization of Commercial Antibody Products
 haNK cells have been widely utilized by over 40 biopharmaceutical companies, including many well-known large-pharma companies, under license for in vitro ADCC testing of their antibodies in development and in certain instances, to release-test their commercially available antibody products. For example, our haNK cells have been adapted for use in commercial assays such as Biotek’s automated Delfia ADCC assay system and Roche and Acea’s xCELLigence system.  In this system, below, it was determined that the EC50 of Herceptin is 48% higher in the absence of haNK cells, thereby demonstrating how haNK assists Herceptin in achieving its peak killing capacity.   
 

17

Irradiated haNK Cells Have a Higher Innate Killing Frequency than Healthy Donor NK Cells 
 
The following graph compares innate killing of target breast cancer cells by healthy donor NK cells versus irradiated haNK cells.  Irradiated haNK cells have a 3-fold higher killing frequency (on a per cell basis) than the average killing frequency of healthy donor NK cells thereby demonstrating substantially greater levels of lysis from irradiated haNK cells across a range of effector to target cell ratios (A). Quantitative analysis of the killing frequency demonstrated that on average, it took three healthy donor NK cells to the same amount of tumor target as one irradiated haNK cell (B).
Irradiated haNK Cells as Efficient Killers of a Wide Range of Cancer Types Through Innate Pathways
 
In the graphs below, irradiated haNK cells exhibit an ability to efficiently lyse and kill 13 human tumor cell lines via innate pathways without the addition of antibodies.  This was demonstrated in innate killing assays including lung, colon, breast, cervical, ovarian and pancreatic and chordoma cancer line.  With the exception of ASPC-1, target killing was consistently observed in an E:T dependent manner.

Addition of Antibody Products to haNK Cells Adds an ADCC Mechanism for Killing Tumors Otherwise Resistant to Innate Killing, in a Dose-Dependent Manner
 The graphs below depict the increasing ADCC killing activity of our haNK cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of either Herceptin or Rituxan observed in in vitro studies. The comparative killing activity of low-affinity 176F expressing aNK, or laNK, cells, aNK alone and haNK with a non-relevant antibody observed are also depicted below.
 
Source: J Immunol. 2008 May 1;180(9):6392-401.
 
In the first graph, aNK, laNK and haNK cells were tested separately in killing of SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells in the presence of varying concentrations of Herceptin. The assay was performed by loading the tumor cells with radioactive chromium-51 and measuring the release by cytotoxicity in a 4 hour assay.  aNK cells expressing the high-affinity 158V variant responded to lower dose of Herceptin (0.001 ug/mL) and exhibited stronger maximal killing response as compared to cells expressing the low-affinity 158F variant. Parental aNK cells, lacking CD16 expression and haNK cells in combination with non-relevant antibody did not exhibit any ADCC response toward the SKOV-3 cells.
 In the second graph, aNK cells expressing the high-affinity 158V variant responded to a lower dose of Rituxan (0.001 ug/mL) and exhibited stronger maximal killing response, as compared to cells expressing the low-affinity 158F variant. Parental aNK cells, lacking CD16 expression, did not exhibit any ADCC response toward the 721.221 B-cell lymphoma cells and haNK together with non-relevant antibody did not trigger any ADCC response.
 20

Synergy Demonstrated When Combining Two Antibody Products together with haNK Cells
 The graph below depicts the synergistic activity of the combination of Herceptin and Perjeta (HER2/HER3) to mediate ADCC killing observed in in vitro studies. Through the application of haNK cells to kill HER2 positive gastric carcinoma cells, the activity observed in the combination of Herceptin and Perjeta was significantly greater than either agent alone.
 

21

haNK Enhances the Killing Capacity of the PD-L1 Checkpoint Inhibitor, Avelumab 
 Irradiated haNK cells and MDA-MB-231 (human breast carcinoma) cells were used as a target at an E:T ratio of 7.5:1.  haNK killing (black bars) and ADCC killing mediated by avelumab (grey bars) are shown in the graphs below. While avelumab alone and control Ab alone show no killing and haNK alone demonstrates some killing via innate pathways, the combination of haNK and avelumab yields the highest degree of killing, attributable to targeting the checkpoint antigen as a target (A). Separately, it was demonstrated that irradiated haNK cells do not exhibit cytotoxic activity against other haNK cells (B). 
 
22

haNK and Avelumab Combination Exhibits Potent Killing Across a Variety of Cancer Types  
 
As illustrated in the graphs below, avelumab-mediated ADCC by haNK cells demonstrated enhanced killing against a variety of cancer types in 4-hour assays, which was even pronounced in 18-hour assays. Both haNK with isotype control (black squares) and haNK with avelumab (blue circles) mediated lysis of H460 human lung carcinoma cells in an E:T dose dependent manner (A). Similar results were also seen with several other human cell lines including cervical cancer CaSki cell (B); HCC4006: lung carcinoma (C); H441: lung carcinoma (D); SKOV3: ovarian carcinoma (E); MDA-MB-231: breast carcinoma (F); and HTB-4: bladder carcinoma (G). 

23

Rationale for Developing our haNK in Combination with Approved and Late-stage Antibody Products That Utilize the ADCC Killing Pathway
 In multiple clinical trials conducted by third parties, patients who were homozygous for high-affinity CD16 (158V/V) generally experienced better responses to exogenous antibody therapy than patients who were carriers of a low affinity CD16 allele (158F carriers or 158F/F or V/F). The illustration from one study below shows the difference in progression-free survival between HER2 positive breast cancer patients treated with Herceptin who have the homozygous high-affinity form of CD16 and those who have the low affinity form to be approximately 20% at 48 months.
 

24

Data from three clinical trials demonstrating this point are shown below. The rationale therefore for combining haNK with Rituxan, Herceptin and Erbitux in patients with low affinity CD16 alleles (158F carriers or 158F/F or 158V/F), should enhance the killing effect of these antibodies and achieve the results for patients with 158V/V alleles.
 

Antibodies are prevalently used and generate over $50.0 billion in reported global annual sales. It has been reported that perhaps only approximately 10% to 15% of the addressable patient population for antibody therapies carry high-affinity CD16 receptors. This implies that our haNK product candidates may have significant market potential for these and potentially all antibody products that kill via the ADCC pathway as a combination therapy to address a large number of patients who have poor responses with antibodies.
 25

Implementing Phase II Combination Immunotherapy Studies That Incorporate haNK Plus Commercially Approved and Select Late-stage Development Antibodies as a Core Component of the NANT Cancer Vaccine Program.
 We plan to conduct a wide range of NANT Cancer Vaccine, or NCV, studies that incorporate haNK directed by genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of tumor and peripheral blood samples offered by affiliates.  Our accelerated strategy is to enroll patients into eleven phase II studies in a variety of cancers that that are currently open and to subsequently advance to registration trials. The following table lists many of the commercial antibody products that can potentially be paired up with haNK therapy.

Phase I/II haNK Clinical Trials
 We announced earlier in 2017 that we received FDA clearance for our first in human haNK trial in patients with advanced solid cancers.  We have since safely dosed patients and submitted this data to the FDA as part of 13 IND applications for our phase II haNK plus NCV trials. Many of these INDs were filed in the second half of 2017, with the balance filed at the start of 2018, all of which have been accepted by the FDA and are in various stages of initiation and enrollment.  Also in 2017, a cryopreserved form of haNK was incorporated into our trials and our corresponding INDs amended. These trials consist of a lead-in phase I safety portion followed by an open-label, single arm phase II portion designed to further assess safety as well as to assess clinical responses. Eligible patients generally include those who have recurrent or metastatic disease that have failed standard of care therapy. Tumor genomic and proteomic testing is conducted as feasible and plays an important role in our trials. Cancer types currently include pancreatic, Merkel cell, squamous cell, triple negative breast, urothelial, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, head & neck, non-small cell lung, colorectal, melanoma and ovarian cancers. Treatment intervention generally includes a tumor conditioning combination consisting of low-dose protein-bound paclitaxel, bevacizumab and certain other agents, depending on the cancer type. This is followed by an immune conditioning combination that includes haNK cells, as the backbone of the regimen, avelumab and an IgG1 antibody product, depending on the cancer testing, IL-15 cytokine therapy and select adenoviral based vaccines, all in a three-week repeating cycle that is conducted entirely in an outpatient setting. 
haNK Clinical Trials Program

Our pancreatic cancer trial was the first haNK NCV study to enroll patients. The trial has been enrolling subjects whose cancer has progressed after standard of care therapy. Encouraging preliminary responses have been observed in the first three patients to reach at least four months on study. These patients entered the trial with preexisting liver metastasis, two with lung metastasis, abnormally elevated CA 19-9 and CEA cancer markers, weight loss and requiring pain management.  Patients received several cycles of haNK plus NCV and there have been no reports of dose limiting toxicities to date. In addition, we observed substantial reduction or normalization of tumor cancer markers such as CA 19-9 and CEA, resolution of pain and the discontinuation of pain management, weight gain, and disease stabilization.    
 28

The regulatory path leading to our current haNK pancreatic cancer trial, QUILT 3.070, maintained a focus on safety while evolving both the therapeutic intervention and the study design, as outlined in the panel below. After demonstrating phase I safety and activity of aNK monotherapy in both single and repeat dosing, we evaluated haNK monotherapy in a similar fashion in QUILT 3.028. We then demonstrated safety of the combination of aNK and NCV in pancreatic cancer patients in QUILT 3.039. This was followed by the introduction of haNK to the NCV combination in QUILT 3.060 and finally the introduction of a cryopreserved haNK formulation together with the addition of low-dose Aldoxorubicin and a design change to extend the length of each treatment cycle to 3-weeks, in QUILT 3.070. Upon completion, we anticipate transitioning to a registration trial that incorporates a standard of care comparator arm.
 
29

A similar path has been followed for our Merkel Cell Carcinoma program, which has now transitioned fully to QUILT 3.045, cryopreserved haNK in combination with IL-15, avelumab and NCV.

Incorporating CAR: Our taNK and t-haNK Programs
 We have genetically engineered our aNK and haNK platforms to express CAR that target specific antigens found on the surface of cancerous cells. These CAR expressing cells, generally called taNKs and t-haNKs, bind to tumor-specific antigens expressed on solid tumors and hematological malignancies and the resulting activation signaling can be strong enough to overcome both cancer escape mechanisms and suppressive factors present in the tumor microenvironment.  Killing is induced through both the release of toxic granules directly into the tumor cell and the release of cytokines and chemokines which stimulate and recruit additional innate and adaptive immune responses, including the recruitment of cytotoxic T-cells. These tumor-specific antigens can be divided into four classes, all of which can be targeted by our taNK and t-haNK platforms: (1) checkpoint inhibitors expressed on the surface of tumor cells such as PD-L1; (2) well-established tumor surface antigens such as HER2 and CD19; (3) newly discovered neoepitopes; and (4) novel surface receptors associated with cancer stem cells.
 The figure below highlights some of the CAR.taNK products and their intended targets using our aNK platform, which appears in the literature.
 
31

The construct for our taNK and t-haNK product candidates is depicted schematically below. We believe that interrogating antibody libraries will allow for the selection of appropriate antibodies that can in turn be translated into CARs that selectively target and bind to known or novel tumor surface antigens.  CARs are complex molecules that are designed to traverse the cell membrane and are comprised of four elements, a) the antibody-derived Fv fragment, or scFv. which appears on the external membrane surface of the taNK or t-haNK cell, where it is exposed and available to bind to cancer specific antigens, b) a transmembrane hinge region, c) an optional CD28 co-stimulatory domain, and d) one of several signaling domain segments which resides on the internal surface of the membrane where, upon external Fv binding, is available to signal the activation cascade to release cytotoxic compounds to destroy the targeted cancer cell.  Unlike CAR-T and TCR therapies, taNK and t-haNK  killing is human leukocyte antigen, or HLA, independent for off-the-shelf applications and do not depend on additional (second generation) co-stimulatory domains, such as 4-1BB or OX40, which are often necessary in CAR-T cells for immune cell activation and survival.
 

Non-Clinical Validation of HER2.taNK, a Compelling Case for taNK and t-haNK-based Therapies
 Our HER2 CAR expressing cell line has been through extensive in vitro and in vivo development spanning several years and is well published. It is based on the FRP5 scFv receptor which targets the most distal domain of human HER2 protein that sits on the surface of the cancer cell. Being the portion of the HER2 protein that is the furthest from the membrane, it serves as an ideal epitope for cell to cell engagement. Trastuzumab, on the other hand, targets HER2’s most proximal domain to the membrane, which works sufficiently well for smaller molecules such as antibodies. Additionally, FRP5, has been safely administered as systemic infusions in human phase I clinical trials with no evidence of cross-reactivity with normal tissues.1
Over-expression of HER2 has been shown to play an important role in the development and progression of several aggressive types of cancers including breast, bladder, brain, head & neck, gastric, colon, ovarian and bladder cancers. This antigen is expressed in up to 20% of breast and up to 30% of bladder cancer patients. The overall HER2 cancer market was $6.0 billion in 2014 based on combined annual sales of Herceptin and Pertuzumab, reported in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 14, 233-234 (2015).

Compelling in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical data has been published on our HER2.taNK cells.
 The panels below show targeted killing of HER2 positive breast cancer cells (red cells) by our HER2.taNK (gray cell). Panel (a) shows how a single Her2.taNK cell safely encounters multiple Her2 negative cells (green) but once it encounters a red cell, it selectively kills it, as exhibited by the loss of td-TOMATO red dye. Panel (b) shows how a single Her2.taNK cell serially kills HER2 positive cancer cells, as exhibited by the serial loss of td-TOMATO red dye. 
 
Source: Mol Ther. 2015 Feb;23(2):330-8
 The data below demonstrate in vivo results for our HER2.taNK in a glioblastoma xenograft immune-compromised mouse model. The images on the bottom left show reduction in tumor burden from day 49 to day 84 and the symptom-free survival curve to the right shows statistically significant greater effect in the HER2.taNK treated arm compared to treatment with unmodified aNK cells and placebo.
 
33

In the another xenogeneic mouse model with Her2+ glioblastoma in which Her2.taNK cells were injected intra-tumorally, five of eight mice demonstrated tumor clearance via brain magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, and survival, bottom left diagram, then went on to re-challenge with tumor on the opposite brain hemisphere.  All five of these mice survived tumor re-challenge, bottom right diagram, which was demonstrated in the next panel to be a humoral and adaptive T-cell response mounted against the cancer. 
 

34

To further characterize the anti-tumor immune response observed with taNK therapy, anti-GL261/ErbB2 IgG levels were measured and found to be significantly elevated in the immune mice, bottom left diagram.  When the CD4 and CD8 T-cells were depleted, a recurrence of tumor was observed in these mice, indicating a cellular component to the immune rejection observed, bottom right diagram. Humoral and adaptive immune responses, therefore played a critical role in the achievement and maintenance of the observed vaccine effect.  
 
Initiating First In Human Trials with HER2.taNK and other CAR Targeting Products
 Our Her2.taNK product has been established as a fully compliant clinical grade master cell bank, which presently serves as an original and exclusive source of product for U.S. and European clinical trials. 
 Authorization was received in 2017 from the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, or PEI, the regulatory granting agency for biologics in Germany, for the first in human phase I/II trial for HER2.taNK cells in a study called CAR2Brain.taNK for patients with recurrent glioblastoma. The first patient was dosed earlier this year with no reported adverse events. 
 HER2.taNK cells will soon be studied in combination with NCV agents in U.S. phase I/II trials in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and other malignancies. Our U.S. IND submission for HER2.taNK in HER2 positive breast cancer is currently on track for filing early this year.  
 Additional targeted taNK and t-haNK products are currently in development for a variety of cancers. Several prominent CARs for taNK and t-haNK have been prepared and are advancing towards human-enabling and phase I clinical trials to address an even broader range of cancers in combination with the NCV regimen. CARs being developed include PD-L1, CD19, CD33, CD123, EGFR, and many others. As illustrated in the pipeline chart below, our most advanced t-haNK product, CD19.t-haNK is being prepared for an anticipated IND submission this year, which will build on earlier safety data to advance into phase II combination with commercially available antibodies, such as rituximab together with NCV.

Achievements in Process Development, Scale-Up Manufacturing and Clinical Supply 
 Manufacturing has been one of our fastest growing functions in 2017. We have made significant strides throughout the year in all of our core manufacturing and ancillary operational areas, including process development, scale-up manufacturing, materials sourcing, completion and certification of production facilities, all the way through and including clinical trial supply. An extensive set of manufacturing methods patent applications have been filed to protect this body of pioneering work, which will serve as an added layer of protection to our already extensive patent estate. In addition to solving critical issues relating to optimized growth conditions and maximum concentrations in culture, we have incorporated expansion protocols that have the potential to be scaled to 500 liters and beyond. High-volume continuous-flow cell harvesting and cryopreservation in individual dose forms have likewise been implemented at our current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, production facility, which has been qualifying and releasing frozen haNK for our phase I advanced solid tumor and phase II second-line pancreatic trials since the last quarter of 2017.  Shelf-life stability for frozen haNK, which is currently 6+ months, continues to extend to enable the accumulation of product stockpiles for potential immediate on-demand availability. Additionally, clinical sites would no longer be required to prepare the final product formulation or conduct release testing prior to administration. Clinical sites would simply need to warm the cells in a warming bath and infuse. Simplified clinical site requirements for product administration potentially expands clinical utility well beyond select certified hospital centers and into outpatient community practices, where the patients reside.
 By the end of 2017, we have successfully eliminated our dependency on expensive and over-subscribed third-party contract manufacturing vendors and we believe that we have a clear roadmap to achieve economy of scale for our haNK production. Our strategy has been to be prepared for a rapid increase in clinical product demand, as our expanded 2018 study program advances, and subsequent commercial launch. Our pilot cGMP manufacturing facility in Culver City, California, opened in 2017 and is serving as our primary production site until our high-capacity, state-of-the-art cell-based manufacturing plant in El Segundo, California, commences clinical production.  The vast majority of the construction and outfitting was completed in 2017, with minor reconfiguration and certification to be completed early in 2018. 
 36

Our aNK platform production process most closely resembles that of the widely-used monoclonal antibody manufacturing process, without the challenging extraction and purification steps at the end, and bears little resemblance to the autologous CAR-T process.  The figure below shows how a master cell bank is established, starting with a Chinese hamster ovary, or CHO, cell line, in the case of antibody products and with an aNK cell line in the case of haNK, taNK and t-haNK products. Both utilize genetic engineering to achieve the desired clones, which after selection, is expanded to create a master cell bank. From this point, a culture can be initiated from a single vial from the bank, which eventually can fill a bioreactor. In both cases, such a bioreactor can run for months, yielding an intermittent supply of material for harvesting. In the case of antibody products, it is the supernatant containing the antibody protein that must be separated from the cells, isolated and purified before making dose forms. In the case of haNK, the product is the cells, so they simply need to be centrifuged and washed before making dose forms. A single bioreactor can produce a sizable number of dose forms for multiple patients over the life of the culture.
 

37

The next panel below, compares the manufacturing of autologous adaptive immunotherapy of CAR-T with that of haNK, taNK and t-haNK. CAR-Ts can have high unit manufacturing costs and complex processes, including harvesting T-cells from patients in an invasive procedure called leukapheresis. Once the T-cells have been adequately collected, they are sent to the manufacturing facility to be genetically engineered and then expanded in a dedicated cGMP clean-room. Then through an elaborate series of procedures, the cells are selected using bead removal before ultimately sending the dose back to the hospital for infusion back into the original patient.  Manufacturing our allogeneic “off-the-shelf” haNK, taNK and t-haNK cells involves a rapid, scalable and cost efficient process where cells from a master cell bank vial is grown in a bioreactor and once ready to harvest, the cells are centrifuged and washed before placing into final dose forms. One vial from the master cell bank can potentially produce thousands of frozen dose forms that would be ready on demand, without the 2-3 week delay in orchestrating the logistics involved with the CAR-T method. 
 
We are also developing novel manufacturing methods, both in equipment utilizing state-of–the-art optics and proprietary media to maximize the attributes of our NK platform. We believe that this automated, closed platform manufacturing process will give us the ability to conduct manufacturing in a non-classified, lower cost manufacturing environment.
 Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that our proprietary aNK platform, differentiated haNK, taNK and t-haNK product candidates, strategic collaborations and cell-based immunotherapy expertise may provide us with competitive advantages. However, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. The key competitive factors affecting the success of any approved product will include the efficacy, safety profile, pricing, method of administration and level of promotional activity.
 38

Our haNK, taNK and t-haNK product candidates will compete with other cell-based immunotherapy approaches using T- and dendritic cells. We are aware of companies developing product candidates focused on NK cells. These companies include Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene Corporation and Innate Pharma. Companies that are currently focused on T-cell based treatments include Adaptimmune Limited, Amgen Inc., Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bluebird Bio, Inc., Celgene Corporation, Cellectis SA, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Intrexon Corporation, Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Kite Pharma/Gilead Sciences, Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc. and Ziopharm Oncology, Inc. There is currently one approved dendritic cell-based cancer vaccine, PROVENGE, which is marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Other companies focused on developing dendritic cell-based product candidates include Argos Therapeutics, Inc., Biovest International, Inc., ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd., Immune Design, Inc., Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Intrexon Corporation and Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc.
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any treatment we may commercialize and they may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our treatments.
 Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and subject registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new therapies enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have a better safety profile, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, we expect that our therapeutic products, if approved, will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products and our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We seek to consistently file follow-on patents applications on further improvements and features of our NK cell-based products, thereby adding additional layers of protection and reducing reliance on our original patents that would be the earliest to expire and may be subject to challenge.  We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of NK cell-based immunotherapy. We expect to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, patent term adjustment and patent term extensions when available, as well as on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
 39

We have developed and in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and we possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of NK cell-based immunotherapy product candidates, including related manufacturing processes and technology. As of December 31, 2017, our owned and licensed patent portfolio consists of patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. disclosing subject matter directed to certain of our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements and our most advanced product candidates, as well as licensed and owned patents and pending applications in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., that, in many cases, are counterparts to the foregoing U.S. patents and patent applications. For example, these patents and patent applications include claims directed to:

 As for the NK cell-based immunotherapy products and processes we develop and commercialize, in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue, when possible, composition, method of use, dosing and formulation patent protection. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technology. The patents and patent applications outside of the U.S. in our portfolio are held primarily in Europe, Canada, Australia, China, Japan and Korea.
 Individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. The patent term may be adjusted to compensate for delayed patent issuance, when such delays are caused by the patent office or successful appeals against patent office actions. There is no limit on this patent term adjustment. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. Our issued patents will expire on dates ranging from 2018 to 2032. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2018 to 2036. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.

The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of immunotherapy has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products and the methods used to manufacture those products. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. However, the area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our patented product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our product candidates. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.
 As of December 31, 2017, our registered trademark portfolio contained ten registered trademarks in the United States, 20 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions (four of which are Madrid Protocol trademarks), four pending trademark applications in the United States, and 13 pending trademark applications in foreign jurisdictions. We may also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section on “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property” and “Legal Proceedings.”
 Collaboration Agreements
 Altor BioScience Corporation.  In August 2016, we entered into an exclusive Co-Development Agreement, or the Co-Development Agreement, with Altor Bio Science Corporation, or Altor.  Our Chairman and CEO is also the Chairman of Altor and holds a greater than 20% ownership interest therein.  Under the Co-Development Agreement, we agreed with Altor to exclusively collaborate on the development of therapeutic applications combining the Company’s proprietary natural killer cells with Altor's ALT-801 and/or ALT-803 products with respect to certain technologies and intellectual property rights as may be agreed between the parties for the purpose of jointly developing therapeutic applications of certain effector cell lines.
 We will be the lead developer for each product developed by the parties pursuant to the Co-Development Agreement unless otherwise agreed to under a given project plan.  Under the terms of the Co-Development Agreement, both parties will grant a co-exclusive, royalty free, fully paid-up, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense (only to a third-party contractor assisting with research and development activities under this C/o-Development Agreement and subject to prior consent, not to be unreasonably withheld), under the intellectual property, or IP, including the parties interest in the joint IP, solely to conduct any development activities agreed to by the steering committee as set forth in any development plan.  Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties in the development plan for a project, we shall be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by either party related to conducting clinical trials and other activities under each development program, including costs associated with patient enrollment, materials and supplies, third-party staffing, and regulatory filings.
 Each company will own an undivided interest in and to all rights, title and interest in and to the joint product rights. The Co-Development Agreement expires upon the fifth anniversary of the effective date.  We dosed several patients with ALT-803 in our phase II Merkel cell carcinoma and our phase Ib/II pancreatic cancer trials under the Co-Development Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Licenses
Viracta.  In May 2017, we entered into an agreement with Viracta to grant us exclusive world-wide rights to Viracta’s phase II drug candidate, VRx-3996, for use in combination with our platform of natural killer cell therapies. Our Chairman and CEO is also the Vice Chairman of Viracta.  In consideration for the license, we are obligated to pay to Viracta (i) mid-single digit percentage royalties of net sales of licensed products for therapeutic use; and (ii) milestone payments ranging from $10.0 million to $25.0 million for various regulatory approvals and cumulative net sales levels. We may terminate the agreement, in our sole discretion, in whole or on a product by product and/or country by country basis, at any time upon 90 days’ prior written notice. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach or for bankruptcy of the other party.
 Hans G. Klingemann, M.D., Ph.D.  We hold the worldwide rights, title and interest to the NK-92 cell line and we believe that we control commercial use of our NK-92 cells in key territories. We also maintain and exclusively control the only clinical grade master cell bank for NK-92. The original NK-92 cell line was isolated by Hans G. Klingemann, M.D., Ph.D., our founder and Vice President of Research and Development, and all patents and patent applications pertaining to this cell line are now in the name of NantKwest, Inc. or ZelleRx Corporation, our former name. In February 2003, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license from Dr. Klingemann to the NK-92 cell line, and related NK-92 patents and know-how, including the NK-92 cell line, that had been assigned to him by the British Columbia Cancer Agency, to manufacture, use and sell products covered by the scope of any valid claim in any of the licensed patents. Dr. Klingemann subsequently assigned the cell line and those patents to us, but we are still obligated to pay a single-digit royalty on sales of licensed products to Dr. Klingemann, as well as to pay the British Columbia Cancer Agency a small percentage of our profits from the sale of the NK-92 cell line that Dr. Klingemann obtained from them.
 Fox Chase Cancer Center.  In July 2004, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Fox Chase Cancer Center or Fox Chase, pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain patents and know-how pertaining to CD16 receptors-bearing NK-92 cell lines. We agreed to pay Fox Chase low single-digit royalties on sales of licensed products. We are also obligated to pay Fox Chase a percentage of the royalties and other compensation we receive from sublicensees of our rights from Fox Chase. Fox Chase is obligated to assign the licensed patents to us if we commence a phase III clinical trial of a licensed product and, if this does not occur, our license expires when the last of the licensed patents expires.
 Rush University Medical Center.  In March 2004, we entered into a license agreement with Rush University Medical Center pursuant to which Rush granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to certain intellectual property related to clinical use of NK-92 to develop and commercialize products and processes for the treatment of melanoma renal cancer, or for the diagnosis or treatment of non-melanoma and non-renal cancer. In consideration for the license, we are obligated to pay to Rush single-digit royalties on sales of licensed products with a minimum royalty payment of $25,000 per year, as well as non-material milestone payments upon completion of certain clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones. We also agreed to pay to Rush a portion of certain payments that we receive under sublicensing arrangements. The license has a term of 12 years from 2006, the year in which royalty payments were first made, and includes customary termination rights for us and Rush.
 University Health Network.  In May 2005, we entered into a license agreement with University Health Network, or UHN, pursuant to which we obtained from UHN an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to certain intellectual property relating to NK-92 clinical trials data from UHN to develop and commercialize products and processes for the diagnosis and treatment of certain hematological malignancies. Our license from UHN will automatically expire if we have not filed for regulatory approval or launched a licensed product within specified periods of time, and also includes other customary termination rights for both us and UHN.
Joint Development and License Agreements
 Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.  In December 2014, the Company entered into a Joint Development and License Agreement with Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc., or Sorrento. The agreement expired in December 2017.  Since no joint product candidates were identified during the exclusive term, Sorrento has no rights to use the Company’s NK cells or other technologies or intellectual property rights or to begin related research, development or commercialization activities and the Company is free to pursue, and is actively pursuing, research, development and commercialization activities with antibodies that may bind to various targets, including PDL1, CD19 and FLT3.
 Intrexon Corporation.  In February 2010, we entered into a 17-year agreement with Intrexon Corporation, or Intrexon, pursuant to which we granted to Intrexon a worldwide, sublicensable license which may be exclusive with respect to certain indications designated by Intrexon, under certain patents relating to NK-92 cells to develop and commercialize modified NK-92 cells that express Intrexon’s proprietary gene sequences for use as therapeutic and prophylactic agents in humans in specified therapeutic areas. Intrexon paid us a one-time license fee and is also obligated to pay non-material milestone payments with respect to specific indications, a royalty on net sales of the licensed products and a portion of the revenue Intrexon receives from third party sublicensees of its rights from us. Intrexon has the right to terminate the agreement upon 180 days’ notice and both Intrexon and we have the right to terminate the agreement for the other’s uncured breach of the agreement.
 42

We have licensed or sub-licensed our cell lines and intellectual property to numerous other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for non-clinical uses such as laboratory testing. Such licenses generally require the licensee to pay an upfront fee and annual research and commercial fees for products sold using our intellectual property and cell lines.
 GSH and DRK-Blutspendedienst Baden-Wurttemberg-Hessen gGmbH, or BSD, License Agreement.  In August 2015, we entered into a license agreement with GSH and BSD under which we were granted an exclusive license to certain GSH-BSD patents, materials and know-how that specifically targets ErbB2 expressing cancers.  In addition, GSH granted us an exclusive license to certain GSH only technology and materials.  In consideration for the licenses, we agreed to pay initial and annual licensing fees, regulatory and commercial milestones and low single-digit percentage royalties on net sales of licensed products.  The royalty term shall continue in a particular country until the later of (i) the expiration of the valid patent claims in such country, or (ii) a specified period of time after the first commercial sale of licensed product in such country.  The license agreement shall continue until no further payments are due at which time the licenses and rights will continue on a non-exclusive, royalty-free basis.  The license agreement can be terminated earlier:  (i) for material breach by either party after 60 days cure period, (ii) if we declare bankruptcy or insolvency, (iii) by us at our sole discretion upon 60 days prior written notice.  We paid and expensed $1.1 million for the initial license fees in 2015 under the license, which was included in research and development expense on the consolidated statement of operations for year ended December 31, 2015.  Annual license fees under the agreement begin in 2018.
 During the third quarter of 2017, GSH reached the first regulatory milestone of a receipt of the first Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval for the phase I Glioblastoma Study.  We expensed $0.9 million for the first milestone payment under the agreement, which is included in research and development expenses on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 Anticipated Agreements and Considerations
 In addition to the collaboration agreement and license agreements discussed above, we may enter into an agreement relating to an IL-15 superagonist product developed by an affiliate and we are also pursuing supply arrangements for various investigational agents controlled by affiliates and third parties to be used in our clinical trials.  These collaboration agreements do not typically specify how sales will be apportioned between the parties upon successful commercialization of the product.  As a result, we cannot guarantee that we will receive a percentage of the revenue that is at least proportional to the costs that we will incur in commercializing the product candidate.  Furthermore, if Dr. Soon-Shiong was to cease his affiliation with us or with NantWorks, these entities may be unwilling to continue these relationships with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and as a result may impede our ability to control the supply chain for our combination therapies.
Government Regulation
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices, or cGLP, regulation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee for each clinical site before the clinical trial is begun;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all required clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 43

 
• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigational sites to assess compliance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States, which must be updated annually and when significant changes are made.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 When a clinical trial using genetically engineered cells is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving National Institutes of Health, or NIH, funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation is submitted to and the study is registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, and many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, a federal advisory committee that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety, or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA web site and may be accessed by the public. If the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
  
• | Phase I. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 44

 
• | Phase IV. In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called phase IV studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Phase I, phase II and phase III testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 BLA Submission and Review by the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial User Fee to the FDA, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once a BLA has been filed, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter, a Complete Response Letter or a not approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may request additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 45

If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or other restrictions to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more phase IV post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. For a fast track product, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. A fast track designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Sponsors may request the FDA to designate a breakthrough therapy at the time of or any time after the submission of an IND, but ideally before an end-of-phase II meeting with FDA. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller or more efficient clinical trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough designation also allows the sponsor to file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis. We may seek designation as a breakthrough therapy for some or all of our product candidates.
 Fast Track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Orphan Drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.

If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.
 A designated orphan drug many not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may, among other things, halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA.
 Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, and exclusion from participation in governmental health programs, like Medicare and Medicaid. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 Our sales, promotion, medical education, clinical research and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, physician payment transparency laws, privacy laws, security laws, and additional federal and state laws similar to the foregoing.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, the knowing and willing, direct or indirect offer, receipt, solicitation or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients, including the purchase, order or lease of any good, facility, item or service that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. The government has enforced the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham research or consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payors.
 Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, or FCA, imposes liability on persons or entities that, among other things, knowingly present or cause to be presented claims that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed for payment or approval by a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons or entities that “cause” the submission of claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, submitting claims for services not provided as claimed, or submitting claims for services that were provided but not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other illegal sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, certain companies that were found to be in violation of the FCA have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, restricting the manner in which they conduct their business.
 48

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors; knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; and willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our products, once commercialized, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, for payments or other transfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Covered manufacturers are required to collect and report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data to the government each year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Additionally, entities that do not comply with mandatory reporting requirements may be subject to a corporate integrity agreement. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on covered manufacturers’ marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements on certain health care providers, plans and clearinghouses (collectively, “covered entities”) and their “business associates,” relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain states have their own laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other and/or HIPAA in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, and diminished profits and future earnings, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 In addition to the foregoing health care laws, we are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We adopted an anti-corruption policy in connection with the initial public offering of our common stock in July 2015. The anti-corruption policy mandates compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws applicable to our business throughout the world. However, we cannot assure you that such a policy or procedures implemented to enforce such a policy will protect us from intentional, reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.

Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement are provided by third-party payors. Third-party payors include state and federal government health care programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, we cannot be certain of this. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the cost-effectiveness, and reducing reimbursement for medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our net revenue and results. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective and thus may not be covered or sufficiently reimbursed. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, as each payor will make its own determination as to whether to cover a product and at what level of reimbursement. Thus, one payor’s decision to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that another payor will provide coverage or that the reimbursement levels will be adequate. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
Healthcare Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 By way of example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to our potential drug candidates are:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 50

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include, among others, the Budget Control Act of 2011, which mandates aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.
 We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.  Furthermore, the current presidential administration and Congress are also expected to attempt broad sweeping changes to the current health care laws.  We face uncertainties that might result from modifications or repeal of any of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions.  The impact of those changes on us and potential effect on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries as a whole is currently unknown.  But, any changes to the Affordable Care Act are likely to have an impact on our results of operations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operation.  We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislative or regulation in the United States may have on our business.
 Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Germany
 We filed an application to commence clinical studies in Germany with the German federal institute for vaccines and biomedicines, or the PEI, the regulatory Agency of the German Federal Ministry of Health. Clinical trials shall be performed to allow data on the safety and efficacy of the relevant medicinal product to be collected. The results of the clinical trial must subsequently be included in the application for marketing authorization and are assessed by the regulatory authorities. The entity responsible for a clinical trial application and its subsequent conduct is called the “sponsor” in accordance with European Union Law. The role of the clinical trial sponsor goes beyond the actual financing and extends to the overall responsibility for the proper conduct of the clinical trial including the proper manufacturer and labelling of the investigational medicinal product. 
 The process required by applicable law before a clinical trial with an investigational biologic product candidates may commence generally involves the following:
  
• | a legal representative situated within the European Economic Area, if the sponsor`s registered place of business is situated outside the European Union;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by the respective competent federal higher authority (for biological products the PEI);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a favorable opinion from the ethics committee competent for the federal state where the study is conducted;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an insurance policy in favor of the clinical trial participants in the event that a person is killed or a person's body or health is injured during the course of the clinical trial, which provides benefits (at least 500,000 € for each case), even when no one else is liable for the damage, with an insurance carrier authorized to conduct business in a Member State of the European Union or another State Party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the clinical trial participants informed consent documented in writing, including the purpose and scope of the recording and use of personal data, especially medical data;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | as part of an initial clinical trial application, a signed clinical trial protocol, the investigator`s brochure, an investigational medicinal product dossier regarding manufacturing and quality including the result of a pharmacological-toxicological test of the medicinal product in accordance with the prevailing state of scientific knowledge and a stability protocol for the biological investigational medicinal product; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 51

 
• | reporting of ongoing clinical studies and subsequently clinical study results to the EudraCT-register of the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 When assessing the application for approval of a clinical trial involving an investigational biological product, the PEI and the ethics committee will consider the following:
  
• | when the investigational medical product is using genetically modified organisms, unjustifiable harmful effects on the health of third persons or the environment may not to be expected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical justifiability of the foreseeable risks and inconveniences, compared with the benefit for the clinical trial participants, and the anticipated significance of the medicinal product for medical science;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | conduct of the clinical trial in an appropriate facility by a suitably qualified investigator and the trial is managed by an investigator who can provide evidence of at least two years' experience in the clinical trial of medicinal products; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a plan for the further medical treatment and supervision of the clinical trial participants after the end of the clinical trial in accordance with the GCP Ordinance - GCP-V.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 When the investigational medical product is a somatic cell therapeutics, after the confirmation of receipt of the application dossier conforming to the regulations, the period of time for the evaluation of the contents by the PEI is ninety days. The PEI might only accept the application subject to certain conditions. The conduct of a clinical trial consists of four phases (I. to IV.). The character of phase I to phase IV are similar to those described above. During the course of the clinical trial, the sponsor is obliged to promptly notify the PEI and ethics committee of unexpected adverse events and/or of any amendment to the clinical trial protocol. 
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 139 employees. Personnel of related companies who provide corporate, general and administrative, manufacturing strategy, research and development, regulatory and clinical trial strategy and other support services under our shared services agreement with NantWorks, LLC, are not included in this number.  See Note 9 Related Party Agreements of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information.  Our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our management systems, recruit and train new employees and select qualified independent contractors. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
