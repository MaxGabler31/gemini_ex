Item 1. Business.
 
As used in this Report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Registrant,” the “Company,” and “Kaival” refer to Kaival Brands Innovations Group, Inc., unless otherwise indicated.
 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated on September 4, 2018 in the State of Delaware. Effective July 12, 2019, we changed our corporate name from Quick Start Holdings, Inc. to Kaival Brands Innovations Group, Inc. The name change was effected through a parent-subsidiary short-form merger of Kaival Brands Innovations Group, Inc., our wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary formed solely for the purpose of the name change, with and into us. We were the surviving entity.
Holding Company Reorganization
 
On September 4, 2018, USSE Delaware, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“USSE Delaware”) acquired all of our then-outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (our “Common Stock”), resulting in us becoming its wholly-owned subsidiary. On September 19, 2018, our wholly-owned subsidiary, USSE Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“USSE Merger Sub”), merged with and into USSE Delaware, our then parent, effected a reorganization (the “Holding Company Reorganization”) in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 251(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”). USSE Delaware was the surviving corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary. USSE Delaware also changed its name to USSE Corp. following the Holding Company Reorganization.
 
Upon completion of the Holding Company Reorganization, by virtue of the merger, and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of USSE Delaware’s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Holding Company Reorganization was automatically converted into one validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable share of our Common Stock. Additionally, each share of USSE Delaware’s preferred stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time was converted into one validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable share of our preferred stock, having the same designations, rights, powers, and preferences, and the qualifications, limitation, and restrictions thereof, as the corresponding share of USSE Delaware’s preferred stock. Each share of our Common Stock issued and outstanding and held by USSE Delaware immediately prior to the effective time was canceled.
 
Change of Controls
 
On October 19, 2018, we issued 500,000,000 shares of restricted Common Stock and 400,000 shares of Convertible Series B preferred stock to GMRZ Holdings LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“GMRZ”), for services rendered to us. GMRZ became our controlling stockholder as a result of such issuances. On February 6, 2019, we entered into a non-binding Share Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) by and among GMRZ, Kaival Holdings, LLC (formerly known as Kaival Brands Innovations Group, LLC), a Delaware limited liability company (“KH”), and us, pursuant to which, on February 20, 2019, GMRZ sold 504,000,000 shares of our restricted Common Stock, representing approximately 88.06 percent of our then-issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, to KH, and KH paid GMRZ consideration in the amount set forth in the Agreement (the “Purchase Price”). The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement resulted in a change in control of us, with KH becoming our largest controlling stockholder. The sole voting members of KH are Nirajkumar Patel and Eric Mosser. The Purchase Price was paid with personal funds of the members of KH.
Share Cancellation and Exchange Agreement
 
On August 19, 2020, we entered into a Share Cancellation and Exchange Agreement (the “Share Cancellation and Exchange Agreement”) with our controlling stockholder, KH.
 
Pursuant to the Share Cancellation and Exchange Agreement, KH returned to us 300,000,000 shares of our Common Stock (the “Cancellation Shares”), which Cancellation Shares were canceled and retired by us. Following such cancellation, KH owns 204,000,000 shares of our Common Stock.
 
On August 19, 2020, we filed a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights, and Limitations of the Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Certificate of Designation”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which authorized a total of 3,000,000 shares, par value $0.01 per share, of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”).
 
In exchange for the Cancellation Shares, we issued 3,000,000 shares (the “Preferred Shares”) of our newly designated Series A Preferred Stock to KH. The exchange of the Cancellation Shares and the issuance of the Preferred Shares was intended to comply with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, in that the issuance was exempt from the registration requirements of the Act because the exchange of the Cancellation Shares for the Preferred Shares was an exchange between us, as issuer, with an existing stockholder, and no commission or other remuneration was paid or given directly for the exchange.
 
Subsidiaries
 
On August 31, 2020, we formed Kaival Labs, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Kaival Labs”), as our wholly owned subsidiary.
 
Reverse Stock Split
 
On July 16, 2021, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a 1-for-12 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of the shares of our Common Stock. The Reverse Stock Split was effective as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on July 20, 2021. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Any fractional shares of our Common Stock that would have otherwise resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole number. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, our Board approved appropriate and proportional adjustments to all outstanding securities or other rights convertible or exercisable into shares of our Common Stock, including, without limitation, all preferred stock, warrants, options, and other equity compensation rights. All historical share and per-share amounts reflected throughout our consolidated financial statements and other financial information in this Report have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split as if the split occurred as of the earliest period presented. The par value per share of our Common Stock was not affected by the Reverse Stock Split.

Business Information
 
Description of Business
 
We are focused on growing and incubating innovative and profitable products into mature, dominant brands. On March 9, 2020, we commenced business operations by entering into an exclusive distribution agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) with Bidi, a related party company, which Distribution Agreement was amended and restated on May 21, 2020 and again on April 20, 2021 (collectively the “A&R Distribution Agreement”) in order to clarify some of the provisions. Pursuant to the A&R Distribution Agreement, Bidi granted us an exclusive worldwide right to distribute the ENDS and related components (the “Products”) for sale and resale to both retail level customers and non-retail level customers. We ceased all retail/direct-to-consumer sales in February 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the A&R Distribution Agreement, Bidi provides us with all the branding, logos, and marketing materials to be utilized by us in connection with our marking and promotion of the Products. We do not manufacture any of the Products we resell. Currently, the Products consist primarily of the “BIDI® Stick,” a disposable, tamper-resistant ENDS Product and, once launched, of which there can be no assurances, the “BIDI® Pouch,” which provides a tobacco-derived nicotine formulation, containing natural fibers and a chew-base filler.
 
The A&R Distribution Agreement extends the previous one-year, annual renewable term to an initial term of ten years, which automatically renews for another five-year term; provided, that we satisfy certain minimum purchase thresholds. The A&R Distribution Agreement also provides us with a right of first refusal in the event Bidi receives an offer that would constitute a “change of control transaction,” as well as a right of first refusal to act as the exclusive distributor of any and all future products of Bidi that arise out of or related to ENDS and components related to ENDS, , or arise out of or related to the tobacco-derived nicotine industry.
 
In connection with the A&R Distribution Agreement, we entered into non-exclusive sub-distribution agreements, some of which were subsequently amended and restated by the parties in order to clarify certain provisions (all such sub-distribution agreements, as amended and restated, are collectively referred to as the “Sub-Distribution Agreements”), whereby we appointed the counterparties as non-exclusive sub-distributors. Pursuant to the Sub-Distribution Agreements, the sub-distributors agreed to purchase for resale the Products in such quantities as they should need to properly service non-retail customers within the continental United States (the “Territory”).
 
We process all sales made only to non-retail customers, with all sales to non-retail customers made through Bidi’s age-restricted website, www.wholesale.bidivapor.com. We ceased all retail/direct-to-consumer sales in February 2021 in order to better ensure youth access prevention and to comply with the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking (“PACT”) Act. We provide all customer service and support at our own expense. Bidi sets the minimum prices for all sales made by us. We maintain adequate inventory levels of the Products in order to meet the demands of our non-retail customers, and deliver the Products sold to these customers.
 
FDA PMTA Determinations – Impact on Business
  
In September 2021, in connection with the PMTA process, the FDA effectively “banned” flavored ENDS by denying nearly all then-pending PMTAs for such products. Following the issuance of an MDO, manufacturers are required to stop selling non-tobacco flavored ENDS products. As of September 10, 2021, the FDA announced that it has taken action on over 93% of applications and issued Marketing Denial Orders (“MDOs”) for more than 1,167,000 flavored ENDS products, while issuing zero marketing authorizations. Bidi, along with nearly every other company in the ENDS industry, received a MDO for its non-tobacco flavored ENDS products. With respect to Bidi, the MDO covered all non-tobacco flavored BIDI® Sticks, including its Arctic (menthol) BIDI® Stick, which Bidi believes the FDA mischaracterized as “flavored.” BIDI believes that because its Arctic BIDI® Stick is menthol, it should not be subject to the MDO. Bidi and the Company believe this position is aligned with the FDA’s public statements and press releases stating that tobacco and menthol ENDS are not deemed flavored products subject to the MDOs.
 
On September 21, 2021, Bidi filed a 21 C.F.R. § 10.75 internal FDA review request specifically of the decision to include the Arctic BIDI® Stick in the MDO. We anticipate a decision from the FDA on the internal review in the second or third quarter of 2022, however, we cannot provide any assurances as to the timing or outcome. Further, on October 22, 2021 pursuant to 21 C.F.R. § 10.35(a), the FDA issued an administrative stay of Bidi’s MDO pending its re-review of the MDO, which FDA initiated at Bidi’s request.   The FDA lifted this administrative stay on December 17, 2021. 
 
Separate from the MDO re-review request and the Section 10.75 petition for the Arctic BIDI® Stick, on September 29, 2021, Bidi also filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (the “Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals”) initiating an appeal of the MDO. Oral arguments in the merits-based case are currently scheduled to occur in May 2022. Until the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals makes a final determination in this case, its judicial stay of the MDO issued on February 1, 2022 will remain in place. The court-ordered stay means that the MDO is not legally in force. Accordingly, we anticipate being able to continue marketing and selling the Products, subject to the FDA’s enforcement discretion, while Bidi continues with its merits case challenging the legality of the MDO. FDA has indicated that it is prioritizing enforcement against companies that have either not submitted PMTAs, or whose PMTAs have been refused acceptance or filing by FDA, or whose PMTAs remain subject to MDOs. , 
 
Historically, substantially all of our revenues were derived from sales of flavored BIDI® Sticks, including the Arctic (menthol) BIDI® Stick, sales of which constituted approximately 18.4% and 12.9%,   respectively, of our total sales of BIDI® Sticks for the twelve months ended October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2020.  Generally, substantially all of the ENDS industry’s revenue is derived from the sales of flavored products.
 
Our business is ultimately dependent upon the outcomes of the FDA’s decision on Bidi’s Section 10.75 petition regarding the inclusion of the Arctic BIDI® Stick in the MDO and the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeal’s ruling on Bidi’s challenge of the MDO.
 
Despite the ongoing uncertainty regarding the ENDS industry, including the FDA’s review and PMTA process generally, and the outcome of Bidi’s pending litigation specifically, Bidi informed us that it is not wavering in its commitment to demonstrating that all its BIDI® Stick products are appropriate for the protection of the public health and demonstrating to the FDA that these products should remain on the market as an alternative for adult cigarette smokers. In this regard, Bidi has appealed the MDO (and already received a court-ordered stay of the denial) and plans on continuing to complete multiple ongoing studies, including a clinical pharmacokinetic, or PK, study, and several actual use and perception and intention studies to support its PMTA. Data for several of these studies has already been submitted to the FDA and indicate that, compared to tobacco-flavored ENDS, the flavored BIDI® Sticks do indeed provide an added benefit for adult cigarette smokers while outweighing any risks to youth posed by flavored ENDS, particularly when considering Bidi’s stringent youth access prevention measures.

Current Product Offerings
 
Pursuant to the A&R Distribution Agreement, we sell and resell ENDS Products, also referred to as (“e-cigarettes”), to non-retail level customers. Our primary Product we resell is the “BIDI® Stick,” a disposable, tamper-resistant ENDS product that comes in a variety of flavor options for adult cigarette smokers. The court-ordered stay means that the MDO is not legally in force. Accordingly, we anticipate being able to continue marketing and selling the Products, subject to the FDA’s enforcement discretion, while Bidi continues with its merits case challenging the legality of the MDO. FDA has indicated that it is prioritizing enforcement against companies that have either not submitted PMTAs, or whose PMTAs have been refused acceptance or filing by FDA, or whose PMTAs remain subject to MDOs. All of our flavor options will continue to be available to the 11 European Markets we have received marketing and distribution approvals. We are wholly dependent on Bidi to supply the BIDI® Sticks to us for distribution. Accordingly, any supply or other issues that impact Bidi, indirectly impacts us and our ability to operate our business.
 
In addition to the BIDI® Stick, we anticipated launching distribution of the “BIDI® Pouch,” initially outside of the United States. The initial planned February 2021 roll-out of the BIDI® Pouch was delayed due to COVID-19 based manufacturing and supply chain constraints. Due to these complications, and in effort to prevent future bottlenecks, Bidi decided to move manufacturing in-house. In 2021, Bidi modified the planned formulation of the BIDI® Pouch. The original BIDI® Pouch formulation intended to utilize a tobacco-free (synthetic) nicotine formulation, along with natural fibers and a chew-base filler in six different flavors. However, the BIDI® Pouch product is now being placed on temporary hold domestically due to the likelihood of the FDA enforcement of synthetic nicotine products as drugs, which will require a PMTA determination from the FDA. More specifically, while the BIDI® Pouch, which made with synthetic (tobacco-free) nicotine, would not fall within the meaning of a tobacco product as set forth in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), the FDA could take the position that such product is a drug. A drug is defined in Section 201(g) of the FDCA, in pertinent part, as “articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals” (i.e., the “disease” or “therapeutic benefit” prong) or “articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or function of the body of man or other animals” (i.e., the “structure/function” prong). Given nicotine’s well-known structure/function effect on the body there is a chance the FDA will take the position that synthetic nicotine products, such as the BIDI® Pouch, are subject to the FDA’s drug authority and can only be marketed with an approved New Drug Application (even if no disease or therapeutic benefit claims are made). Indeed, prior to the enactment of the Tobacco Control Act (the “Tobacco Control Act”), the FDA historically took the position that any product with added nicotine (other than traditional tobacco products) was a drug, even when marketed for recreational use and without specific claims of smoking cessation or other therapeutic benefit. It is, of course, illegal to distribute a drug without the FDA’s approval. Given these concerns, Bidi has decided not to launch the synthetic-nicotine BIDI® Pouch at this time, but will instead seek a PMTA marketing authorization from the FDA for the BIDI® Pouch made with tobacco-derived nicotine.
 
On July 14, 2021, we announced plans to launch our first Kaival-branded product, a Hemp CBD product. In addition to our Kaival-branded formulation, we anticipate that we will also provide white label, wholesale solutions for other product manufacturers through our subsidiary, Kaival Labs. However, as of the date of this Report, we have not launched any Kaival-branded products, nor have we begun to offer white label, wholesale solutions to other product manufacturers.
 
Once we launch a Hemp CBD product, of which there can be no assurances, we intend that all CBD products will be produced and distributed strictly in compliance under the 2018 Farm Bill, which defines hemp as the plant Cannabis sativa and any part of the plant with a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3 percent by dry weight. According to the 2018 Farm Bill, hemp-derived products can be offered for retail sale in the many forms: smoke, pouch, tinctures, topicals, capsules, vape oil and gummies/edibles. We plan to utilize Bidi’s patented BIDI® Stick delivery mechanism in order to provide a similar, premium experience in the initial CBD product line. We expect our industrial-grade hemp CBD formula to provide greater bioavailability than many market peers, resulting in a better consumer experience in less usage.
 
Recycling Program
 
In addition to our current product offerings, Bidi launched its recycling program, Bidi Cares, in the spring of 2020 that provides an opportunity for its adult (21 years of age or older) customers to recycle their BIDI® Sticks and be rewarded with a free BIDI® Stick after recycling ten used BIDI® Sticks. Each BIDI® Stick contains UL 8139 Certified batteries, which are high-quality, recyclable batteries that are distinguishable from batteries used in other ENDS Products. Bidi invests in recyclable batteries as a more sustainable solution to reduce electronic waste.
Marketing Strategy
 
Currently, we market and place our Products into national distribution channels through long-standing industry relationships in accordance with the A&R Distribution Agreement. We process all sales made to non-retail customers.
 
Our long-term marketing strategy remains based on FDA compliance and our commitment to preventing underage access to our Products. As such, we steer away from social media marketing and, instead, are more focused on ground-level marketing and advertising within authorized retailer locations (i.e. advertisement on retail partners’ back-bar tobacco products area). Part of this ground-level marketing effort focuses on supporting our authorized partner stores and distributors in spreading brand awareness of our Products to their adult (21 years of age and older) consumer base by providing in-store marketing materials. Additionally, we supplement these efforts with informational videos on Bidi’s fight against underage access to vape products and content on what makes the BIDI® Stick unique, among other types of content.
 
Retail stores also have access to online informative videos about the Bidi story, which can be used to educate and assist in training all of their staff members about the core values of Bidi. From the recycling initiative to the commitment to preventing underage ENDS use, and stand against the illicit market of ENDS products, we believe that together with Bidi, we are taking the necessary steps to ensure that our partners are aligned with our community goals.
 
Bidi also attends trade shows at established expos throughout the United States, such as the National Association for Convenience Stores (NACS) Show most recently held in July 2021 and the Tobacco Product Expo (TPE) held in January 2022. Further, Bidi has a dedicated marketing team that focuses on these marketing efforts and more.
 
Distribution Territories
 
In addition to the United States, the BIDI® Stick has received marketing and distribution approval in 11 European markets, including the United Kingdom. In the United States, marketing and distribution is currently limited by the FDA’s MDO issued to Bidi, which is not legally in force as a result of the judicial stay . In the European markets, Bidi has marketing and distribution approval for all BIDI® Stick flavors (in compliance with the nicotine concentration limitations in those countries). Accordingly, in light of the pending MDO, the uncertainty regarding whether Bidi’s PMTAs will be placed back into scientific review and whether FDA will ever find that the BIDI® Sticks are appropriate for the protection of the public health, Bidi intends to expedite the planned product launches into foreign markets starting with the United Kingdom.   We are also actively exploring potential partnerships with international distribution companies in order to possibly expand Product distribution more rapidly in these international markets.

Resellers
 
Currently, our potential distribution network reach is approximately 48,000 stores in the United States. Our Products can be found in many Circle K convenience stores and 7 ELEVEN locations throughout the United States through our partnership with Lakshmi Distributor Inc., doing business as C Store Master (“C Store Master”), as well as stores operated by Grocery Supply Warehouse (“GSW”), Smoker Friendly International and Avail Vapor LLC. We also have relationships with wholesalers, such as Hilmes Distributing. Finally, our Products are also accessible to adults 21 years of age and older through the age-gated digital delivery service mobile application, GoPuff, in more than 50 cities across the United States.
 
We expect that in the second or third quarter of fiscal 2022, we will launch distribution of the Products in Europe, which will further expand our distribution footprint.
 
Concentrations
 
Concentration of Purchases and Accounts Payable- Related Party:
 
For the year ended October 31, 2021, 100% of the inventories of Products, consisting solely of the BIDI® Stick, were purchased from Bidi, a related party company that is owned by Nirajkumar Patel, our Chief Executive Officer, in the amount of approximately $61.9 million, as compared to $54.0 million for the year ended October 31, 2020. In fiscal years 2021 and 2020, such inventories accounted for 100% of the total accounts payable.
Concentration of Revenues and Accounts Receivable:

For the year ended October 31, 2021, a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of Products, solely consisting of the BIDI® Stick were derived from the following customers: (i) Favs Business, LLC (“Favs Business”) generated approximately 23%, (ii) MMS Distributing, LLC (“MMS Distro”) generated approximately 16%, and (iii) C Store Master generated approximately 14 %. For the year ended October 30, 2020, a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of Products, solely consisting of the BIDI® Stick were derived from the following customers: (i) Favs Business generated approximately 41% and (ii) MMS Distro generated approximately 6%.
 
In addition, Favs Business and C Store Master accounted for approximately 50% and 16% of the total accounts receivable from customers, respectively, as of October 31, 2021. Go Brands, Inc. (“Go Brands”) and GPM Investment, LLC (“GPM”) accounted for approximately 33% and 56% of the total accounts receivable from customers, respectively, as of October 31, 2020.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this Report we have nine employees, all of whom are full time, including our officers. In addition to our officers, we have employees who fulfill the roles of sales staff, information technology, web development, warehouse staff and account management. All of our employees are eligible to enroll, or have already enrolled, in our medical plan.
Environment and Government Regulation Related to our Operations
 
Because we are only a retail and wholesale distributor of the Products, namely the BIDI® Stick, we believe that we are only subject to Federal, state, and international laws pertaining to a distributor, not a manufacturer, of ENDS Products.
 
Our business is dependent entirely on the resale of the Products provided by Bidi; thus, there is a significant risk that our business could be materially adversely affected if Bidi, as the manufacturer, does not properly abide by any Federal, state, or international laws that regulate ENDS Products. Any lapse in production or availability of the Products from Bidi would hamper our ability to operate as we would be limited in our ability to supply our customers if our inventory ran low, or ceased to exist entirely.
 
As a manufacturer of ENDS Products, Bidi is responsible for abiding by and following various rules and regulations pertaining to the manufacturing of the ENDS Products we sell and any lapse in abiding by any pertinent rules and regulations may negatively impact our ability to operate. As a distributor, we are also subject to various rules and regulations. Some of the below may not directly apply to us at this time due to the nature of our present operations. These rules and regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
FDA and Related Regulations Relating to ENDS Products
 
Effective August 8, 2016, the FDA’s regulatory authority under The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was extended to all remaining tobacco products, including: (i) certain “new generation” products (such as electronic cigarettes, vaporizers, and e-liquids) and their components or parts (such as tanks, coils, and batteries); (ii) cigars and their components or parts (such as cigar tobacco); (iii) pipe tobacco; (iv) hookah products; or (v) any other tobacco product “newly deemed” by the FDA (the “Deeming Rule”). The Deeming Rule applies to all products made or derived from tobacco intended for human consumption, but excluding accessories of tobacco products (such as lighters).
 
The Deeming Rule requires (i) United States manufactured products be registered with the FDA and that products include ingredient listings; (ii) newly deemed products be marketed only after FDA review and authorization, subject to FDA’s compliance enforcement policy; (iii) products only make direct and implied claims of reduced risk if the FDA authorizes after finding that scientific evidence supports the claim and that marketing the product will benefit public health as a whole; (iv) sellers of such products refrain from distributing free samples; (v) sellers of such products implement minimum age and identification restrictions to prevent sales to individuals under age 18; (vi) packaging of and advertisements for products include prescribed health warnings; and (vii) sellers refrain from selling the products in vending machines, unless the machine is located in a facility that never admits youth. We, along with Bidi, must comply with these regulations. Any lapse in compliance by us, or Bidi, could hamper our ability to operate, which would adversely affect our results of operations.
 
Newly deemed tobacco products are also subject to the other requirements of the Tobacco Control Act, such as the products cannot be adulterated or misbranded. The FDA could in the future promulgate good manufacturing practice regulations for these and our other Products, which could have a material adverse impact on Bidi’s ability to, and the cost to, manufacture our Products, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Failure to comply with the Tobacco Control Act and or with any FDA regulatory requirements could result in litigation, criminal convictions or significant financial penalties and could impair our ability to market and sell our electronic and vaporizer products. At present, we are unable to predict whether the Tobacco Control Act will impact our Products to a greater degree than competitors in the industry, thus affecting our competitive position.
 
As part of the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021,” signed into law on December 27, 2020, Congress amended the PACT Act to apply to ENDS, which includes the BIDI® Stick. The PACT Act regulates the sale, transfer, or shipment of cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, smokeless tobacco, and now ENDS, for both business-to-business transactions as well as online sales. The PACT Act imposes substantial restrictions on sellers and shippers of ENDS products, including, but not limited to: registration with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (the “ATF”); registration with state Tobacco Tax Administrators, and monthly reporting requirements to state and local Tobacco Tax Administrators. Delivery sellers are subject to substantial additional restrictions, including, but not limited to, compliance with state excise tax collection requirements, licensing requirements, shipping, and packaging requirements. Companies were required to comply with PACT Act requirements beginning on or about March 28, 2021.
 
We have adopted the following compliance measures:
 

● | We have retained a team of legal, tax and accounting experts to advise on state and local tax, licensing, and regulatory matters associated with the distribution of the BIDI® Stick; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are appropriately licensed or registered in every state which requires it;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-


● | We calculate and remit excise taxes where required;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | We have made a substantial investment in excise tax reporting and compliance software to ensure that all applicable taxes are properly calculated and remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities. The software is now completely integrated with our systems;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have registered with the ATF and the states into which we ship the Products; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have implemented processes to ensure timely filing of all required reporting.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In February 2021, the Company ceased online direct-to-consumer sales through its website.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

State and Local Regulations
 
As a retail seller and/or wholesale distributor of ENDS and related products, we must follow several state and local regulations. Individual U.S. state laws and regulations concerning e-cigarette and related products are also relatively new and developing. Currently, certain state laws on the subject of e-cigarette and related products serve to define and/or tax tobacco products or e-cigarette and related products, restrict access to youth and/or retail sale, require a license to sell such products, ban e-cigarette use in certain public spaces, and require child resistant packaging on products containing e-liquids. As a distributor, we hold all required state licenses and permits, and pay all applicable state e-cigarette and related products excise taxes. We work closely with Bidi to ensure that it is compliant with any manufacturer specific state requirements, such as any warning requirements (e.g., California Proposition 65).
Excise Taxes on Vapor Products
 
Vapor products are currently subject to excise taxes at the state and local level. Currently, approximately 29 states, plus various localities and jurisdictions, impose a tax on vapor products. We anticipate that state and localities will likely continue to impose new excise taxes on these products and / or increase existing excise taxes for the purpose of funding various legislative initiatives, filling revenue shortfalls, and / or to reduce consumption. In addition, while ENDS products are not currently subject to excise tax at the federal level, legislation to impose excise taxes at the federal level has been introduced in the past and could potentially be adopted in the future. Any future enactment of excise tax increases at the federal, state, or local level could potentially result in lower consumption, a shift in sales to discount brands, illicit trade channels or alternatives as consumers seek lower priced products, any of which could result in a decline of our shipment volume, revenue, and profit. In February 2021, Bidi ceased online direct-to-consumer sales through its website.
International Regulations and Pertinent Information
 
The World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (“FCTC”) is the first international public health treaty that establishes a global agenda to reduce initiation of tobacco use and regulate tobacco in an effort to encourage tobacco cessation. Over 170 governments worldwide have ratified the FCTC. The FCTC has led to increased efforts to reduce the supply and demand of tobacco products and to encourage governments to further regulate the tobacco industry. The tobacco industry expects significant regulatory developments to take place over the next few years, driven principally by the FCTC. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced, or enacted include:

● | the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing, and sponsorship;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing, and sponsorship;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings, and other labeling requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors and generic packaging;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale, and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requirements regarding testing, disclosure, and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide, and other smoke constituents levels;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requirements regarding testing, disclosure, and use of tobacco product ingredients;

If the United States becomes a signatory to the FCTC and/or national laws are enacted in the United States that reflect the major elements of the FCTC, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
 
Environmental Laws
 
We may be subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these provisions has not had, nor do we expect such compliance will have any, material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, financial condition, or competitive position. We believe that we are not subject to any material costs for compliance with any environmental laws.

Competition
 
Because we solely distribute Bidi’s Products, which comprises all of our business operations, Bidi’s competitors in the ENDS industry are indirect competitors of ours. Many of these competitors in the ENDS industry are better capitalized than we are and have access to greater resources, financial, and otherwise. We believe that our ability, and Bidi’s ability, to effectively compete in the industry and acquire a strong market position is, and will continue to be, in large part due to the growing recognition of the Bidi brand name, the perceived quality of each of our Products, and the ongoing efforts of our sales, marketing, and distribution teams. We, through Bidi, compete against, just to name a few, what we refer to as “big tobacco” companies, including Altria Group, Inc. (formerly Philip Morris); British American Tobacco p.l.c. (formerly Reynolds); Swedish Match; Swisher International; and manufacturers including U.K. based Imperial Brands, PLC, NJOY, Logic Technology. “Big tobacco” has substantially greater resources, and a customer base that has historically demonstrated loyalty to their brands, which can pose a significant hurdle to competitors operating in the same, or similar, industries.
 
Competition in the ENDS industry is based upon not only brand quality and positioning but also on price, packaging, promotion, and retail availability and visibility. Given the decreasing prevalence and public acceptance of cigarette consumption, the “big tobacco” companies continue to demonstrate an increased interest and participation in other/additional tobacco industries/markets. As such, we consider the “big tobacco” companies to be our primary competitors at this point in time, but it is our belief that we have the capability to compete successfully.
 
Based on Goldman Sachs’ Equity Research Report through January 29, 2022 on the Nielsen data for total nicotine volumes (the “Goldman Report”), the BIDI® Stick was the largest disposable ENDS Product based on retail sales for the 52-week period ending on January 29, 2022. The BIDI® Stick has increased its absolute-dollar market share of the disposable ENDS market share from 24.2% during the 52-week period ending on January 28, 2021 to 42.4% of retail sales during the 52-week period ending on January 29, 2022. According to the Goldman Report, total dollar sales growth has surged to 2,879% to lead the category for the 12-week period ended January 29, 2022. We believe our growth underscores the unique customer experience the BIDI® Stick provides.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Currently, as of the date of this Report, we have no intellectual property rights other than the trademarks KAIVAL BRANDS AND KAIVAL LABS. We rely on certain intellectual property rights, including logos, trademarks, and trade names, of Bidi that were granted to us pursuant to the A&R Distribution Agreement to be used in connection with the marketing, advertisement, and sale of the Products. We also indirectly rely on Bidi’s intellectual property rights related to the Products, such as patents. If a third-party challenged Bidi’s patents, or infringed upon such rights, our business would be materially adversely affected.
Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an emerging growth company (“EGC”), that is exempt from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). The JOBS Act eases restrictions on the sale of securities and increases the number of stockholders a company must have before becoming subject to the reporting and disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). We have not elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies.
