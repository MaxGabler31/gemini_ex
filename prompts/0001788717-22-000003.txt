Item 1. Business
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “F45,” “the Company,” and “our Company” refer to F45 Training Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries.
In assessing the performance of our business, we use certain key measures for determining how our business is performing. The below metrics are used throughout this Form 10-K and, unless otherwise indicated, all references to such metrics shall have the meanings ascribed to such metrics below: 
In assessing the performance of our business, we use certain key measures for determining how our business is performing. The below metrics are used throughout this Form 10-K and, unless otherwise indicated, all references to such metrics shall have the meanings ascribed to such metrics below: 
•“Average Unit Volume” or “AUV” means average studio-level revenue generated by a group of studios during a particular period of time. Due to the relatively young age of our studio base, we believe it is appropriate to assess AUV for studios that have been open for the full period for which AUV is calculated. We define a cohort as a group of studios that opened during the same full year and are also open and operational during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.
◦“Cash-on-cash returns” means studio-level EBITDA over initial investment.
◦“Initial Studio Openings” means the number of studios that were determined to be first opened during such period. We classify an Initial Studio Opening to occur in the first month in which the studio first generates monthly revenue of at least $4,500. Initial Studio Openings are not adjusted downward for studios that were temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise.
◦“Members” refers to the number of paying members who were billed $20 or more in membership fees in a given month.
◦“New Franchises Sold” means, for any specific period, the number of franchises sold during such period using the methodology set forth below for “Total Franchises Sold.”
◦“Open Studios” means the number of studios that were open for business as of a certain date. A studio may be classified as an Open Studio regardless of whether or not it generated minimum monthly revenue of $4,500. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of our network was forced to temporarily close, which reduced the number of Open Studios. As studios re-open in accordance with state and local regulations, they are reflected in the Open Studios figures.
◦“Same store sales” means, for any reporting period, studio-level revenue generated by a comparable base of franchise studios, which we define as open studios that have been operating for more than 16 months.
◦System-wide Sales” are defined as all payments made to our studios and includes payment for classes, apparel and other sales for a given period. We track System-wide Sales as an indication of the strength of our franchisee network.
◦“Total Franchises Sold” represents, as of any specified date, (i) the total number of signed franchise agreements in place as of such date for which an establishment fee has been paid and (ii) the total number of franchises committed in a multi-studio agreement in place as of such date for which an upfront payment has been made, in each case that have not been terminated. Each new franchise is included in the number of Total Franchises Sold from the date on which such franchise first satisfies the condition in clause (i) or (ii) above, as applicable. Total Franchises Sold includes franchise arrangements in all stages of development after signing a franchise agreement, and includes franchises with open studios. Franchises are removed from Total Franchises Sold upon termination of the franchise agreement.
◦“Total Studios” as of any specified date, means the total cumulative Initial Studio Openings as of that date less cumulative permanent studio closures as of that date. Total Studios are not adjusted downward for studios that were temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise.
◦“Visits” means the number of registered individual workouts for any specified period. A workout is registered when the consumer checks into a class.
Additionally, This annual report contains estimates, projections and other information concerning our industry, our business, our franchises and the markets for our products and services. Some data and statistical information are based on independent reports from third parties, including the International Health, Racquet & Sports Club Association, or IHRSA, and a member survey with 4,184 respondents that we conducted in October 2017.
Some data and other information related to our franchisees, including estimated initial investment, EBITDA margins and average unit volumes, are based on internal estimates and calculations that are derived from research we conducted. In order to determine certain franchise and studio-level information, we conducted a survey of our franchisees, or the Franchise Survey, in July 2019, which only reflects data from prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. This survey was provided to the franchisees of all studios at the time that the survey was conducted and generated responses from franchisees representing approximately 57% of studios across our global network of studios. In generating the data, estimates and calculations derived from the information provided by these respondents, we excluded certain responses that were incomplete or that we determined to be significant outliers. As a result, while we believe that the data and other information related to our franchisees presented in this annual report are accurate and reliable, such data and other information are based on responses provided by a limited respondent pool, which may not represent the broader network of franchisees, and that have not been independently verified by us or any independent sources. Such data also does not reflect any impacts on our business or franchisees from COVID-19 or otherwise after July 2019.
We are F45 Training, the fastest growing fitness franchisor in the world according to Entrepreneur in 2021, focused on creating a leading global fitness training and lifestyle brand. We primarily offer consumers functional 45-minute workouts that are effective, fun and community-driven. Our workouts combine elements of high-intensity interval, circuit and functional training to offer consumers what we believe is the world’s best functional training workout. We deliver our workouts primarily through our digitally-connected global network of studios, and we have built a differentiated, technology-enabled platform that allows us to create and distribute workouts to our global franchisee base. Our platform enables the rapid scalability of our model and helps to promote the success of our franchisees. We offer consumers a continuously evolving fitness program in which virtually no two workouts are ever the same. Our vast and growing library of functional training movements allows us to vary workout programs to keep consumers engaged with fresh content, stay at the forefront of consumer trends and drive maximum individual results, while helping our members achieve their fitness goals.
We were founded in 2013 in Sydney, Australia. Our CEO and co-founder Adam Gilchrist recognized an opportunity to leverage technology to offer consumers an effective, multi-disciplinary and 
community-driven workout that serves as an affordable alternative to one-on-one personal training and repetitive, single-discipline studio classes. Soon after the first F45 Training studio opened in Paddington, Australia, our founders focused on using technology to streamline and standardize the F45 Training experience in order to franchise the business. We quickly expanded, initially selling franchises to members of the original studio, after which viral word-of-mouth marketing led to rapid growth, and we opened nearly 200 studios over the following 30 months. In less than nine years, we have scaled our global footprint to 3,301 Total Franchises Sold in 67 countries, including 1,749 Total Studios.
Our in-studio experience utilizes our proprietary technologies: our fitness programming algorithm and our patented technology-enabled delivery platform. Our fitness programming algorithm leverages a rich, growing content database of over 8,000 unique functional training movements across modalities to offer new workouts each day. Our content delivery platform allows us to standardize the F45 Training experience across our global footprint and broadcast content, including workout instructions and timing, directly to our in-studio technologically-enabled content delivery platform, or F45TV, and speaker systems. Our in-studio experience is further enhanced by trainers who provide guidance on proper form and movement, as well as motivate our members and foster a positive sense of community. We believe our approach helps to provide a consistent and high-quality fitness experience across our network of studios, keeping members highly engaged and helping them to achieve and sustain their fitness goals.
We operate a nearly 100% franchise model that offers compelling economics to us and our franchisees. We believe our franchisees generally benefit from a relatively low initial investment and low four-wall operating expenses, which allows them to generate strong profitability and returns on investment. The optimized box layout of our studios, which requires as little as approximately 1,600 square feet of training area, contributes to the relatively low initial investment and operating costs of our franchise model, and allows our studios to be located in a wide array of attractive prospective retail locations. We believe this flexibility will help enable us to capitalize on our estimated long-term global opportunity of over 23,000 studios. Based on the Franchise Survey conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we estimate that a typical F45 Training franchise in a normalized operating environment requires an aggregate initial investment of approximately $315,000 and, in its third year of operation can produce average EBITDA margins in excess of 30% and average cash-on-cash returns in excess of 33%.
We believe our franchise model is attractive due to its potential for asset-light growth, strong profitability and robust cash flow generation, and has helped to facilitate our rapid growth and strong financial performance prior to, and resilience during, the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite challenges posed by the pandemic, we grew our footprint and experienced minimal permanent closures, which we believe underscores the durability of our business model. Between 2019 and 2021 we grew our Total Franchises Sold at the compound annual rate of 32% and our Total Studios at the rate of 24%. Between 2020 and 2021, our Total Franchises Sold increased by 47% and our Total Studios increased by 22%.

1 Due to the lead time associated with opening a new studio after a franchise is sold, Total Franchises Sold is always greater than Total Studios as of a certain date. Of our 3,301 Total Studios as of December 31, 2021, we had 1,749 Total Studios, which are studios that were open for business

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a significant impact on the gym and fitness industry generally, as well as our business, financial condition and results of our operations. Following the outbreak of the pandemic in early 2020 and at its initial peak, nearly all of our studios temporarily closed pursuant to local, state and federal mandates and guidelines. As businesses have been allowed to re-open, we have worked closely with our franchisees in helping to re-open their studios. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 1,580 Open Studios, which represented 90% of our Total Studios. The remaining 10% of our Total Studios are generally located in regions that continue to face restrictions, which we expect to be lifted in due course.
We believe our performance over the course of the pandemic has underscored the resilience of our business model. While our revenues decreased to $82.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $92.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the pandemic, between February 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, only 20 studios permanently closed due to financial hardship or otherwise, which represents approximately 1% of our Total Studios as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, less than approximately 1% of our Total Backlog Studios, which is the difference between the Total Franchises Sold and Total Studios, terminated franchise agreements during that same period. These metrics compare favorably to the estimated 25% of all U.S. fitness facilities that had permanently closed as of January 1, 2022, according to IHRSA.
Despite challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we successfully continued to sell new franchises and open new studios during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021. 
For additional information on the impact of COVID-19 on our business, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—COVID-19 Impact.”
The Three Pillars of F45 Training
Our differentiated approach to fitness is firmly rooted in the three pillars of our DNA: Innovation, Motivation and Results.
Innovation: at the core of everything we do. We are dedicated to driving new innovations that will continue to elevate the F45 Training experience and further our position as a global fitness training and lifestyle brand. We are able to distinguish ourselves from competitors through such innovations as:
•Technology-Enabled Centralized Delivery Platform: Our technology-enabled centralized delivery platform distributes daily workout content via in-studio F45TVs that display proper exercise form, timing and sequencing, driving consistency and efficiency across our global network of studios. In-studio trainers coach members throughout their workout and adjust movements to suit individual levels of experience, strength and flexibility;
•Proprietary Fitness Programming Algorithm: Our fitness programming algorithm configures movements from our vast content library into new workout plans based on various criteria, including duration, target muscle group, equipment type and aerobic versus anaerobic focus, among others, ensuring that virtually no two workouts are ever the same; and
•Curated High-Quality Workout Plans: Our curated workout plans are subject to a rigorous in-house quality control process and are designed to sequence movements in what we believe to be a safe, effective manner. This quality control process is led by our centralized F45 Athletics Department, which consists of training professionals, athletes and sports scientists
Motivation: the key to creating a community and sanctuary. We believe the foundation for any effective fitness program is motivation. We motivate our members through a combination of positivity, 
inclusivity and teamwork, which encourages our members to view each studio as a sanctuary and is driven by:
•Positive Trainers: Our in-studio trainers are responsible for fostering a positive environment for all members before, during and after workouts, and we specifically instruct them to drive positivity, inclusivity and teamwork;
•“No Mirrors, No Microphones, No Egos”: Our studios are deliberately free of mirrors and microphones, which mitigates the appearance-related pressures and trainer intimidation that are associated with many fitness alternatives. Our goal is to emphasize our members’ achievements in completing our workouts; and
•Community: Our positive, inclusive philosophy permeates the studio and creates a genuine sense of camaraderie, team-building and community amongst our members
Results: supported by the sustainability of our workouts over time. We strive to help our members achieve and maintain results by focusing on creating a sustainable fitness program. Our fitness programming algorithm offers new workouts each day and is specifically designed to encourage members to visit studios multiple times per week over the course of their long-term fitness journey. We believe we offer members a winning formula to achieve long-term results, driven by:
•Total Body Workout: Our fitness programming algorithm offers a total body workout that combines cardiovascular and strength modalities to deliver comprehensive results;
•Safety: We believe our emphasis on functional training movements and relatively low weight resistance helps to mitigate the risk of injury, thereby enabling our members to push themselves and maximize individual performance without compromising their safety; and
•Frequency: The curation, style and cadence of workouts, combined with the use of low weight resistance, allows for members to visit as frequently as their schedules permit. Workouts alternate between cardiovascular and strength modalities from day to day, which alternates the impact on the body.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe there are several competitive strengths that form the foundation of our strategy and are key differentiating factors of our business.
The Next Generation Global Fitness Training and Lifestyle Brand Striving to Deliver the World’s Best Workout
Over the last nine years, we have focused on leveraging our differentiated approach to fitness to develop a global brand that is viewed as the gold standard in industry. We strive to offer our members the best functional training workout in each F45, FS8, Malibu Crew, Avalon House and Vive Active studio on a daily basis. Our differentiated, technology-driven approach, including our proprietary fitness programming algorithm’s database of over 8,000 unique functional training movements across modalities, helps us to design workouts that are fun, challenging, safe, dynamic and sustainable for members to attend day after day and week after week. The versatility of our workouts resonates with both women and men, and across a broad range of fitness levels.
Innovative and Differentiated Technology-Enabled Delivery Platform Driving Quality and Consistency within Each Studio
A critical component to the success of our business is our patented technology that provides us with the ability to remotely manage each in-studio experience across our global network of 1,749 Total Studios as of December 31, 2021 from our centralized technology systems at F45 Training headquarters. We have built an automated, centralized delivery platform that gives us the ability to control the delivery and timing of our workout content through our F45TVs in each of our studios. Our centralized delivery platform enables a seamless F45 Training experience on a consistent basis at scale across a broad geographic footprint. In response to temporary studio closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to leverage our technology platform and create a home digital product called F45 AtHome Workouts. This offering provides users with the ability to access part of our library of fitness and wellness offerings from remote or outdoor locations, and allows users to maintain their engagement with F45 during temporary studio closures. In addition, as our studios have re-opened, our adaptable workout model has enabled us to modify workouts so they can be completed in socially distanced setting and with minimal equipment requirements.
Highly Scalable Commercial Delivery and Franchise Development Model
Our differentiated approach, including our fitness programming algorithm and our proprietary technology-enabled delivery platform, plays an integral role in the scalability of our business. By integrating technology into the workout experience, we have been able to develop a franchise model that is highly replicable for both new and existing franchisees across multiple geographies. In addition, our purpose-built studio design, which utilizes an open floor plan and modest physical footprint (as little as 1,600 square feet of training area), can be built within a wide array of attractive prospective retail locations. We have also substantially simplified the pre-opening process by providing franchisees with a comprehensive studio opening pack, which we call a World Pack, that includes the key items needed to operate the studio, including fitness equipment, technology, AV equipment and more. Our World Pack has resulted in a streamlined pre-opening process for our franchisees.
Compelling Franchisee Studio Economics
We believe we offer a compelling business opportunity for franchisees to generate strong returns driven by a relatively low initial investment combined with attractive AUVs and low four-wall operating expenses. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and based on data collected through our booking systems and the Franchise Survey, we estimate that in a normalized operating environment, a typical F45 Training franchise requires an aggregate initial investment of approximately $315,000 and, in its third year of operation can produce an AUV of approximately $354,000, average EBITDA margins in excess of 30% and average cash-on-cash returns in excess of 33%.
Across the F45 network, we believe that many studios that have re-opened following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated the ability to quickly ramp up AUV levels. Further, we believe that many studios that have re-opened following the onset of COVID-19 have been able to return to or lower their pre COVID-19 operating costs. 
Predictable, Asset-Light Model Driving Rapid Growth
As a franchisor, we have employed an economic model that, other than due to the unprecedented global shutdown of our network due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been predictable, asset light and cash flow generative and has enabled us to open new studios at an accelerated pace compared to an owner-operator model. For the majority of franchises that we sell, we receive an upfront payment from the franchisee, which varies by geography. Once a new studio has opened, we receive contractual, recurring monthly franchise fees that provide us with a high degree of revenue visibility. During the certain periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, we offered franchisees temporary relief from contractual monthly franchise 
fees. As our network of total studios grows, we expect recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue to increase.
Given our model is nearly 100% franchised, we have also been able to maintain a strong margin profile. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we reported operating margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin of (61.6)% and 38.8%, respectively. 
Proven Management Team with Value-Added Investors and Ambassadors
F45 Training is led by an experienced and passionate team dedicated to driving the continued growth of the business. Our CEO and co-founder, Adam Gilchrist, has developed and fostered our strategic vision and culture of excellence from the very beginning. Our broader management team consists of a deep bench of experienced professionals with expertise in finance, operations, marketing and other critical areas, which we believe helps to position us to execute on our long-term strategy.
In March 2019, Mark Wahlberg made a strategic minority investment in F45 Training, providing critical branding and marketing capabilities to supplement the strengths of our management team. 
In addition to Mr. Wahlberg, we have established relationships with several internationally recognized ambassadors, including Earvin “Magic” Johnson, Jr., David Beckham, Greg Norman, Cindy Crawford, and other celebrities and professional athletes.
Our Growth Strategies
We believe there are several attractive opportunities to continue to drive the long-term growth of our business.
Expand Studio Footprint in the United States
We believe there is a significant opportunity to meaningfully expand our franchise studio footprint in the United States. As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,710 Franchises Sold and 654 Total Studios in the United States. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had seen the pace of our U.S. growth accelerate with average net Franchises Sold per month increasing from 12 in 2017 to 19 in 2018 to 32 in 2019. Due to COVID-19, the average net Franchises Sold per month decreased in 2020 to 10. In 2021, the average net Franchises Sold per month increased to 65 and 88 in the US and globally respectively, the most in our operating history. We believe there is long-term studio potential for over 7,000 F45 Training studios in the United States.
Expand Studio Footprint Throughout the Rest of the World
We believe in the proven portability of our brand and franchise model, as evidenced by our strong growth outside of our core U.S. and Australian markets. We have designed our studios to be deployed successfully in both developed and emerging markets, and to drive continued growth in both under penetrated and new markets. As of December 31, 2021, we had 788 Franchises Sold outside of our core markets of the United States and Australia. Based on an extrapolation of current Franchises Sold in Australia per capita as of December 31, 2021, we believe there is a long-term global opportunity for over 23,000 studios, with a potential for approximately 16,000 studios outside of the U.S. market. We believe we can continue to grow our international presence through our existing franchising strategy and by opportunistically pursuing master franchising agreements to sell select territories to experienced, local partners.
Generate Incremental Franchise Fee Revenue by Driving Growth in Same Store Sales and AUVs
Our franchise agreements generally provide us with contractual monthly franchise fees equal to the greater of a fixed monthly fee or a percentage of gross monthly studio revenue, generally 7%. We 
believe this model helps to align our interests with those of our franchisees while also providing us with the opportunity to participate in revenue upside as our franchisees grow studio AUVs. 
Pursue Franchise Agreements with Multi-Unit Franchise Systems
The majority of our studios are owned by franchisees who are either owner-operators or investors that have more than one studio. Going forward, we intend to seek opportunities to develop multi-unit franchise systems with select financial partners. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 65% of our Franchises Sold were owned by multi-unit franchisees, up from approximately 50% as of December 31, 2020, which highlights the strong market demand for multi-unit franchise opportunities.
Expand Into New Channels
We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand into new channels, and we are actively pursuing potential opportunities to partner with major universities, hospitality operators, corporations and military facilities. In 2016, we believe we became the first external studio fitness provider to open a studio on a major U.S. university campus through our collaboration with the University of Southern California. As of December 31, 2021, we had 34 studios located on major university campuses in the United States, including Purdue University, Stanford University and the University of Texas at Austin. In 2021, we expanded our presence in the hospitality channel through our partnerships with Hilton Resorts and OneSpaWorld.
Develop Workout Programs to Access New Target Demographics
We believe there is a significant opportunity to create workout programs that enable us to target a broader range of consumer demographic groups.
We recently developed a new fitness concept called FS8, which we began marketing in Australia in March 2021. FS8 integrates three popular methods in the health and fitness industry, the remixing of Pilates, yoga and tone, to create a new workout style. This workout style is an effective method of building lean muscle and definition. FS8 offers members a premium fitness experience through F45’s platform of training systems, the FS8TV and FS8 App, and also offers franchisees a proprietary business model and large community via the franchise network. We also have a dedicated support team to assist across all business functions. As of December 31, 2021, we had sold 123 total FS8 studios in Australia.
During 2021, we also continued the development of additional concepts, including Malibu Crew, a functional fitness studio clubhouse targeting men over the age of 50, as well as Avalon House, a studio sanctuary for women of a similar age. As of December 31, 2021, we had one Malibu Crew and one Avalon House company-owned locations in operation, respectively. We believe there is a significant long-term opportunity to grow the footprints of these concepts through our innovative go-to-market franchise model.
Strategically Utilize M&A to Further Grow Footprint and Attract New Members
The boutique fitness industry remains highly fragmented, which offers attractive opportunities to utilize strategic and bolt-on M&A to drive consolidation. 
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we announced the acquisition of Vive Active, a high-growth, profitable Australian fitness company that offers reformer and mat Pilates workouts through in-studio, at-home streaming and on-demand classes. We completed this acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2021. We plan to continue to grow Vive Active’s footprint through a mix of company-owned studios and franchised studios in select international markets. 
Our Workouts
Functional Training Experience
We believe we offer the world’s best functional training workout. We combine elements of high intensity interval, circuit and functional training to offer our members an intense 45-minute workout consisting of natural real-world movements, such as lifting, squatting, jumping, twisting, kicking, rowing, cycling and other high intensity exercises. Our workouts utilize our proprietary, in-studio technology to allow members to walk through a series of exercise stations. In-studio F45TVs provide video instructions for each exercise, and our in-studio trainers help guide members on proper form and movement. We believe that by designing highly innovative and effective total body workouts that minimize injury risk and allow for increased visit frequency, we provide our members with a fitness program that is well positioned to serve as the basis for achieving their long-term fitness goals.
Dynamic Fitness Programming
Our fitness program consists of strength, cardio and hybrid branded workouts. Our branded workouts are mapped on thirteen four-week cycles, with each cycle focusing on specific disciplines, such as boxing, American football training, partner workouts and more. This structure helps to ensure that each member experiences a differentiated and engaging workout. As new fitness trends arise, we are able to adapt our programming and cater to changing consumer preferences through the continuous evolution of our workouts, utilizing both new and existing content in our branded workout and functional training movement library. Once the branded workout cycle is set, we employ an automated workout programming algorithm that scans our database of over 8,000 unique functional training movements across modalities to select exercises based on each of the branded workout’s defined key characteristics and configure a series of exercises within each workout. Our workout programming algorithm accounts for the following criteria, ensuring every routine is dynamic, sustainable and new:
•movement and exercise types;
•muscle groups;
•type of equipment;
•exercise frequency (avoiding repetition); and
•number of stations and sequencing.
After the algorithm builds a workout cycle, these workouts are then vetted by head trainers in the F45 Athletics Department to confirm quality, avoid duplication of targeted muscle groups or movements and provide for efficient transitions between stations. The new cycle is finalized approximately three weeks ahead of its system-wide release after testing the new program across several test studios for quality and ease of use by trainers and members.
Our Studios
Studio Layout and Design
We have designed our studios around the principles of functionality, simplicity and purpose. Each studio has an optimized footprint, with a minimum training area of as little as approximately 1,600 square feet, which enables our studios to be located in a wide array of attractive prospective retail locations. We believe the flexible design and open floor plan layout of our studios positions us to be responsive to potential shifts in consumer preferences as new fitness trends emerge with different setup requirements. The flexible design of our studios has proven to be particularly helpful in allowing us to effectively modify studio layout to accommodate proper social distancing during the pandemic, as well as enter new channels. 
Each studio has standardized F45 Training-branded fitness equipment and related technology, which includes F45TVs, spin bikes, dumbbells, kettlebells, sleds and more, all of which are included in our World Pack. The wall-mounted F45TVs are positioned throughout the studio to provide an illustrative, station-by-station guide for each workout and to serve as a reference point for members to visualize proper form and progress through each workout station. In-studio trainers provide additional support by helping members execute exercises with appropriate form and resistance level, while offering encouragement and motivation. To drive a welcoming, intimidation-free environment, we purposely 
exclude mirrors on the walls of our studios. Our standardized studio design helps ensure the consistency of the F45 Training experience across our global network of studios.
Studio Membership and Member Pricing
We provide franchisees with suggested pricing for workouts and membership options based on relevant market dynamics, but pricing is ultimately managed at the discretion of our franchisees. Franchisees typically offer multiple membership options, such as weekly memberships with unlimited workouts, monthly memberships with a limited number of workouts, workout packs that include a fixed number of workouts that can be used at any time, as well as single workout options. Franchisees may also offer other membership options, including longer-term memberships for a discounted rate and specific promotional membership plans. Many franchisees offer a limited free trial period to attract prospective new members. We do not offer multi-studio membership plans and memberships are not transferable across our studios.
Franchise Model
Franchising Strategy
We utilize an attractive franchise model that has allowed us to scale our business rapidly. As of December 31, 2021, we had a global network of 3,301 Total Franchises Sold, including 1,749 Total Studios, of which 1,580 had re-opened following one or more temporary COVID-related closures. Approximately 35% of Total Franchises Sold are owned by single-unit franchisee owners, with the other 65% owned by multi-unit franchisees. As of December 31, 2021, our largest franchisee owns 362 franchises, representing approximately 11% of our Total Franchises Sold. As we pursue opportunities to develop multi-unit franchise systems with financial partners, we expect the percentage of multi-unit franchisees to increase over time.
Franchise Agreement
For each franchise license, we enter into an agreement with the franchisee covering standard terms and conditions. We grant our franchisees an exclusive area or territory under the franchise agreement, and territories are determined as agreed with us using our internal analysis, after taking into account population density and demographics. The proposed location must be approved by us, and each franchisee is responsible for the acquisition or lease of the premises from which to operate the business within their respective territory. The franchise agreement requires that the franchisee operate the studio at a specific location.
The typical franchise agreement has an initial five-year term. We may refuse to extend the term of the agreement if the franchisee is in default under the franchise agreement or has failed to achieve minimum performance targets. More specifically, within 12 months of opening, each franchisee must achieve an annual gross revenue of at least 70% of the average gross revenue of all franchisees who have been operating for at least 12 months. Within six months of the expiration of the initial five-year term, franchisees have the opportunity to renew for an additional five-year term, subject to the terms and conditions prevailing at the time of renewal.
The franchise agreement requires franchisees to comply with our standard methods of operation, which govern the provision of services, use of vendors and sale of merchandise. These provisions require that franchisees must generally purchase equipment from us and may only buy products, goods and materials approved by us. We may terminate the franchise agreement upon an event of default by the franchisee, and the franchisee may terminate only with our mutual consent.
Historically, franchisees have paid a fixed monthly franchise fee. Since July 2019, we transitioned our model in the United States for new franchisees to a franchise fee based on the greater of a fixed monthly franchise fee or a percentage of gross monthly studio revenue. In select markets outside of the 
United States, and for renewals of existing franchisees in the United States, we are in the process of transitioning to a similar model.
Attractive Franchisee Return Profile
Our franchise model has the potential to generate strong returns for franchisees as a result of a relatively low initial investment and favorable operating cost structure driven by our purpose-built studio design and proprietary technology-enabled ecosystem. We believe that our scale provides us with cost advantages that allow us to offer our equipment to our franchisees for a significantly lower cost than if they were to acquire it on their own. We recommend that our franchisees typically staff one lead trainer and at least one assistant trainer during business hours. We also provide ongoing back-office support through our customer relationship management capabilities to assist with day-to-day booking and operation of the business. We believe the modest initial investment, combined with limited staffing needs, creates the potential for strong financial performance and expands the universe of potential franchisees.
Industry Dynamics
Favorable Industry Fundamentals
The fitness industry represents a large market that has historically exhibited attractive growth characteristics due to various secular consumer trends. According to IHRSA, the global health club market size was estimated to be $97 billion in 2019, with the U.S. segment of this market representing $35 billion. From 2014 to 2019, the global health club industry grew at a CAGR of 2.8%, with the U.S. health club industry growing at a CAGR of 7.7%. We believe that the following have been, and will continue to be, key drivers of industry growth:
•increased consumer focus on health and wellness, driven by education on the health benefits of exercise;
•changes in consumer spending in favor of experiences, including group fitness; and
•cultural shifts promoting fitness as an aspirational lifestyle and form of community, supporting the studio fitness model.
With only 64.2 million Americans ages six and older having health club memberships according to IHRSA, we believe there is significant opportunity for further growth in fitness engagement and membership in the United States.
COVID Impact on Fitness Industry
The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the fitness industry. At the peak of the pandemic, nearly all health and fitness centers in the United States were closed. Many other developed markets around the world in which we operate experienced similar closures. Multiple health club operators have entered bankruptcy and many gyms and health clubs will never reopen. According to IHRSA, as of January 1, 2022, 25% of fitness facilities in the United States had permanently closed. Our studio network has proven to be resilient in the face of the pandemic, with approximately 1% of the number of total studios permanently closed in the year ended December 31, 2021.
Upon a return to normalcy following the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe fitness and wellness will be top-of-mind for consumers. According to a survey conducted by IHRSA in August 2020, 95% of respondents stated they missed their gym routine and 94% stated they plan to return to their routine in some capacity. We believe we are well positioned to serve new members as restrictions continue to ease and consumers increasingly participate in in-person activities.
Competition
We operate in a competitive and highly fragmented market, with multiple industry segments competing for the consumers’ share of wallet that is allocated to fitness and health. While we operate specifically in the studio fitness category, we consider the following key industry categories as competition:
•other studio fitness concepts;
•full-service health clubs;
•racquet, tennis, country and other athletic clubs;
•value-focused health clubs; and
•at-home fitness offerings, including digital fitness content.
The number, size and strength of our competitors vary by region. Some of our competitors have national name recognition or an established presence in local markets, and some are established in markets in which we have existing studios or intend to locate new studios.
We believe that we successfully compete on the basis of our flexible functional training workout, our F45 Training experience, innovative and proprietary technology platform, compelling franchisee studio economics and our franchise development model. We believe we offer an attractive and flexible price point relative to personal training, while maintaining a competitive rate as compared to other studio fitness offerings.
Marketing Strategy
Our marketing strategy is focused on delivering the highest quality F45 Training experience to franchisees and members of our studios and raising awareness of our brand through a broad range of channels. These channels include influencer, experiential, social media, online search, digital media, TV and print marketing. Marketing activity is conducted both by us and by our franchisees. We utilize a multi-prong marketing strategy focused on attracting and educating prospective franchisees, driving demand with new and existing members and increasing general awareness and affinity for our brand.
Brand Marketing
We seek to drive brand awareness through marketing initiatives that highlight the differentiated F45 Training experience and community. We have created a curated training experience that is driven by technology and supported by community, which drives a powerful brand with broad demographic appeal and a highly passionate member base. Below are representative examples of our marketing efforts:
•Social Media Marketing:  We leverage social media marketing—through Instagram, YouTube and Facebook—as a means to engage with our existing members and attract new members. Across these platforms, existing and new members interact with us, our franchisees and each other by consuming content posted by us on our social media accounts and by sharing their own original content.
•Influencer Marketing: Influencer marketing is a key method through which we embed F45 Training in popular culture. Our partnership with actor and entrepreneur Mark Wahlberg has accelerated our path to becoming a household name in the U.S. market. Further, we have benefited from organic and paid social media promotion of the F45 Training brand by celebrities and professional athletes that visit our studios. In addition to Mr. Wahlberg, we have established relationships with several value-added ambassadors, including Earvin “Magic” Johnson, Jr., David Beckham, Greg Norman, Cindy Crawford, and other celebrities and professional athletes.
•Earned Media: We work with multiple public relations agencies in our key territories who are responsible for driving F45 Training placements across media outlets. We have benefited from significant media enthusiasm around our brand.
•Local Events: We aim to boost brand awareness and foster a sense of community by producing and sponsoring local events in our key territories, with event categories spanning F45 Track (outdoor boot camps), F45 Playoffs (individual and team competitions) and F45 partnership events with a range of hospitality and likeminded health and wellness brands. While we have reduced the number of local in-person events during the pandemic, we plan to increase the frequency of events over time as local regulation permits.
•Marketing Partnerships: We maintain marketing partnerships with leading brands, such as Athletic Propulsion Labs, through which our members gain access to exclusive shoe and apparel releases.
Additional brand marketing strategies include television, outdoor billboard and pasting campaigns in key markets.
Franchisee Sales Marketing
Our primary methods for marketing to prospective franchisees include a mix of social, digital, search, referral and experiential marketing. We have created a scalable and sustainable marketing model through which we identify potential franchisees and pursue qualified leads utilizing our sales team.
In addition to our performance marketing initiatives, we continue to experience the power of word-of-mouth marketing as we open more studios around the world. This network effect is exemplified by the rapid growth of F45 Training in our first market, Australia. The first F45 Training franchisees included members of our first studio, who had a strong community experience and connection with our brand. For example, one franchisee in Sydney was among our first franchisees in 2013 and has expanded from one studio to 90 Franchises Sold, as of December 31, 2021.
Membership Marketing
Our membership marketing efforts, which are conducted both prior to studio opening and on an ongoing basis, focus on targeting the acquisition of new members and the retention of our existing members through local social, search and experiential marketing. Our membership marketing program consists of the following:
•Pre-Opening Membership Marketing Campaigns: Such campaigns are funded by franchisees, and focus on building the studio membership base prior to opening. In these campaigns, our local studio, trainers, owners and marketing teams drive awareness of, and excitement about, our brand through grassroots marketing outreach to influencers, businesses, charitable organizations and schools in the respective community.
•Ongoing Membership Marketing Programming:  Such programming is designed by us, available for a monthly fee and designed to generate and convert leads to new members. We seek to reach and engage with new target audiences using geographic and demographic targeting across social and digital media platforms.
•One-on-One Marketing Support: In addition to the paid membership marketing programming, we provide significant value to studio managers by offering one-on-one marketing support that is specifically tailored to each studio’s needs
Intellectual Property
The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We rely upon a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments and other legal rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. Our standard form of employment agreement includes confidentiality provisions and invention or work product assignment provisions with our employees to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information.
We have a number of patents protecting our workout creation process and screen-based workout technology.
As of December 31, 2021, we held 5 issued U.S. patents and have one U.S. patent application pending. We also hold 20 patents and innovation patents issued in foreign jurisdictions (11 of which have been issued in Australia) and have 4 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents issued in the United States expire between June 2030 and September 2036, and our foreign issued patents expire between May 2022 and November 2039. As of December 31, 2021, we held 84 registered trademarks in the United States, including our logo / logo components and had 37 U.S. trademark applications pending. We also held 302 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions and had 155 trademark applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence of and ability to patent new intellectual property. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology.
We license the use of our marks to franchisees, third-party vendors and others through franchise agreements, vendor agreements and licensing agreements. These agreements generally restrict third parties’ activities with respect to use of the marks and impose brand standards requirements. We generally require licensees to inform us of any potential infringement of the marks.
We register some of our copyrighted material and otherwise rely on legal and contractual protections of our copyrighted works that have been fixed in a tangible medium or otherwise qualify for copyright protection. Such copyrighted materials are not material to our business.
Information Technology & Systems
All studios use a computerized, third-party hosted store management system to process new in-store memberships, bill members, update member information, check-in members and process point of sale transactions. Our websites are hosted by third parties, and we also rely on third-party vendors for related functions such as our system for processing and integrating new online memberships, updating member information and making online payments. We use these third-party vendors to gather data from our franchisees, including information on franchisee performance and operations. We believe these systems are scalable to support our growth plans.
Our back-office computer systems are comprised of a variety of software designed to assist in the management and analysis of our franchisee revenue and key operational metrics as well as support the daily operations of our headquarters. These include third-party hosted systems that assist with onboarding franchisees in accordance with F45 standards, a third-party hosted financial system for reporting, advanced analysis and which helps to facilitate financial analysis and forecasting and a third-party hosted payroll system.
We also provide our franchisees access to a web-based, third-party hosted custom franchise management system to receive informational notices, operational resources and updates, training materials and other franchisee communications.
In relation to our workouts, we utilize a fitness programming algorithm that intelligently selects exercises from a database of over 8,000 unique functional training movements across modalities. This algorithm produces potential workout plans which are then centrally reviewed and staged by our head trainers before ultimately being distributed to studios.
We recognize the value of enhancing and extending the uses of information technology in virtually every area of our business. Our information technology strategy is aligned to support our business strategy and operating plans. We are committed on an ongoing basis to replace or upgrade key systems, enhance security and optimize their performance.
Government Regulation
We and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations affecting our business including those that concern franchise operations, payment processing, consumer protection, information and data privacy and other laws regarding unfair or deceptive trade practices.
We are subject to the FTC Franchise Rule promulgated by the FTC that regulates the offer and sale of franchises in the United States and its territories (including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam) and requires us to provide to all prospective franchisees certain mandatory disclosures in a franchise disclosure document, or FDD. In addition, we are subject to state franchise sales laws in approximately 14 states that regulate the offer and sale of franchises by requiring us to make filings and obtain franchise registration prior to our making any offer or sale of a franchise in those states and to provide an FDD to prospective franchisees in accordance with applicable franchise laws and regulations. We are also subject to franchise relationship laws in approximately 18 states that regulate several aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship, including renewals and terminations of franchise agreements, franchise transfers, the applicable law and venue in which franchise disputes must be resolved, discrimination, franchisees’ right to associate and sourcing, among others.
We are subject to franchise disclosure laws in six provinces in Canada (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Ontario and Prince Edward Island) that regulate the offer and sale of franchises by requiring us to provide an FDD in a format prescribed by such laws to prospective franchisees in accordance with such laws, and that may regulate certain aspects of the franchise relationship.
We are subject to franchise disclosure and relationship laws in Australia that regulate the offer and sale of franchises by requiring us to provide an FDD in a format prescribed by such laws to prospective franchisees and that regulate certain aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship, including renewals and terminations of franchise agreements, franchise transfers, the venue in which franchise disputes must be resolved, franchisees’ right to associate and the use of marketing funds.
In addition, we and our franchisees may also be subject to laws in other foreign countries where we or they do business, including franchise disclosure, registration and relationship (and similar) laws and regulations. For example, we are also subject to franchise registration and disclosure laws in other countries in which we operate, including Australia, Canada, China, France, French Polynesia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, New Caledonia, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan and the United States, that regulate the offer and sale of franchises by requiring us, unless otherwise exempt, to register an FDD in a prescribed format and to provide that FDD to prospective franchisees, in accordance with such laws, and that regulate certain aspects of the franchise relationship.
We and our franchisees are also subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, similar state laws in certain jurisdictions, and various other laws in the United States, Canada, Australia and other foreign jurisdictions governing such matters as minimum-wage requirements, overtime and other working conditions.
Our and our franchisees’ operations and properties are subject to extensive federal, international, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental, building and zoning requirements. Our and our franchisees’ development of properties depends to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements.
We and our franchisees are responsible at the studios we each operate for compliance with state laws that regulate the relationship between health clubs and their members. Nearly all states have 
consumer protection regulations that limit the collection of monthly membership dues prior to opening, require certain disclosures of pricing information, mandate the maximum length of contracts and “cooling off” periods for members (after the purchase of a membership), set escrow and bond requirements for health clubs, govern member rights in the event of a member relocation or disability, provide for specific member rights when a health club closes or relocates, or preclude automatic membership renewals. We and our franchisees primarily accept payments for our memberships through electronic fund transfers from members’ bank accounts, and, therefore, we and our franchisees are subject to both federal and state legislation and certification requirements, including the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. Some states, such as New York, Massachusetts and Tennessee, and countries, such as Australia, have passed or have considered legislation requiring health clubs to offer a prepaid membership option at all times and/or limit the duration for which health club memberships can auto-renew through EFT payments, if at all. Our business relies heavily on the fact that our memberships continue on a month to month basis after the completion of any initial term requirements, and compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and variances and inconsistencies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction may further increase the cost of compliance and doing business. States that have such health club statutes provide harsh penalties for violations, including membership contracts being void or voidable.
Additionally, the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our, or our franchisees’, businesses are regulated at the federal, state and provincial levels as well as by certain financial industry groups, such as the Payment Card Industry, Security Standards Council, the NACHA and the Canadian Payments Association. Federal, state and financial industry groups may also consider from time to time new privacy and security requirements that may apply to our businesses and may impose further restrictions on our collection, disclosure and use of individually identifiable information that are housed in one or more of our databases.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 41 employees in Australia, 115 employees in the United States and 4 employees in the United Kingdom. We also leverage external service providers to support U.S. operations. None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we believe we have an excellent relationship with our employees.
F45 Training franchises are independently owned and operated businesses. As such, employees of our franchisees are not our employees.
We believe that an engaged, diverse, and inclusive culture is essential for the success of our business, and we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success. As such, our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The growth and development of our workforce is an integral part of our success. Another critical component of maintaining our engaged and inclusive culture is making investments in our team members at all levels with our training programs. We are also committed to developing and fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion and know that a company’s ultimate success is directly linked to its ability to identify and hire talented individuals from all backgrounds and perspectives.
Facilities
We do not own any real property. We are currently headquartered in Austin, Texas. We occupy an office space of approximately 44,000 square foot in our new global headquarters. Our lease for our new headquarters expires June 2029. We have one option to extend the lease for five additional years. In addition to our office in Austin, Texas, we have offices in Paddington, Australia and London, England. 
Suppliers
We source substantially all of the equipment provided in our World Pack from a single supplier in China who manufactures products in its own facilities. Our vendor manufactures and holds the inventory until franchisees’ orders are fulfilled. We also source additional equipment and products from suppliers in the United States and Canada and use local distributors for certain gym equipment. Franchisees 
generally purchase equipment through our approved suppliers or must seek written approval for non-approved suppliers. Approved suppliers are those who demonstrate the ability to meet our standards, who possess adequate quality controls and the capacity to supply franchisees’ needs promptly and reliably, whom we have approved in writing and whom we have not later disapproved. We may change the number of approved suppliers at any time and may designate ourselves, an affiliate, or a third party as the exclusive source for any particular item.
Corporate
Our current corporate headquarters address is 3601 South Congress Avenue, Building E, Austin Texas, 78704. For further information please view our official company website at www.f45training.com. Information included or referred to on, or otherwise accessible through, our website is not deemed to form a part of, or be incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Legal Proceedings
We are currently, and from time to time may become, involved in legal or regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, employment disputes and commercial contract disputes. Although the outcome of these and other claims cannot be predicted with certainty and except for those matters discussed below, we are not currently a party to any litigation or regulatory proceeding that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
We have received demand letters from a number of performance rights organizations in the United States and Australia with respect to our and our franchisees’ use of music in studios. On July 1, 2019, we received a letter from Universal Music Group, or UMG alleging copyright infringement and licensing violations in connection with our distribution of music to our franchisees. We have entered into an ongoing tolling agreement with UMG and are having ongoing discussions regarding resolution of the matter. In addition, we previously received demand letters from APRA AMCOS and PPCA, and entered into licensing arrangements with these rights holders. In response to the allegations, we have contracted with Soundtrack Your Brand, a streaming service for businesses, which provides a global database of licensed music that is made available directly to our franchisees. We believe our relationship with Soundtrack Your Brand and the services provided by Soundtrack Your Brand will help to mitigate the risk of future copyright infringement allegations regarding use of music in our studios and during our classes.
