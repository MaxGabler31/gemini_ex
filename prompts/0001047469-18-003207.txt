     Item 1.    Business 
  Overview 
         Rite Aid is the third largest retail drugstore chain in the United States based on both revenues and number of stores. As of March 3, 2018, we operated 2,550 stores in 19 states across the country. 
         Our headquarters are located at 30 Hunter Lane, Camp Hill, Pennsylvania 17011, and our telephone number is (717) 761-2633. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol of "RAD." We were incorporated in 1968 and are a Delaware corporation. 
  Merger AgreementOn February 18, 2018, Rite Aid entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Albertsons, Ranch Acquisition II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Albertsons ("Merger Sub II") and Ranch Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Merger Sub II ("Merger Sub" and, together with Merger Sub II, the "Merger Subs"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into Rite Aid (the "Merger"), with Rite Aid surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Merger Sub II (the "Surviving Corporation"), and (ii) immediately following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will merge with and into Merger Sub II (the "Subsequent Merger" and, together with the Merger, the "Mergers") with Merger Sub II surviving the Subsequent Merger as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Albertsons (the "Surviving Company"). At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each share of Rite Aid's common stock, par value $1.00 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive and become exchangeable for 0.1000 of a fully paid and nonassessable share of Albertsons common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Albertsons Common Stock"), without interest, plus, at the election of the holder of the Rite Aid stock, either (i) an amount in cash equal to $0.1832 per share, without interest, or (ii) an additional 0.0079 of a fully paid and nonassessable share of Albertsons Common Stock. On March 29, 2018, Rite Aid announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in connection with the Merger. The Merger remains subject to other customary closing conditions, including the approval of Rite Aid shareholders. Subject to these approvals, the merger is expected to close in the early part of the second half of calendar 2018. 
         Asset SaleOn October 17, 2017, we began the process of selling the Assets to be Sold (as defined in Item 6) to WBA in accordance with the terms and provisions as contained in the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement"), dated as of September 18, 2017, by and among Rite Aid, WBA and Walgreen Co., an Illinois corporation and wholly owned direct subsidiary of WBA ("Buyer"). During the fifty-two weeks ended March 3, 2018, we sold 1,651 stores and related assets to WBA in exchange for proceeds of $3,553.5 million, which were used to repay outstanding debt, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $2.1 billion. We estimate that the total pre-tax gain on the Sale will be approximately $2.5 billion. As of March 27, 2018, we have completed the store transfer process, and all 1,932 stores and related assets have been transferred to WBA. The transfer of the three distribution centers and related inventory is expected to begin after September 1, 2018. 
         Based on its magnitude and because we are exiting certain markets, the Sale represents a significant strategic shift that has a material effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, we have applied discontinued operations treatment for the Sale as required by generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). 
         In fiscal 2018, we continued reporting our business in two distinct segments. Our Retail Pharmacy Segment consists of Rite Aid stores, RediClinic and Health Dialog. Our Pharmacy Services Segment 
 6

   consists of EnvisionRx, our PBM that has been rebranded as EnvisionRxOptions ("EnvisionRx" or "EnvisionRxOptions"). 
         Retail Pharmacy SegmentIn our Rite Aid retail stores, we sell prescription drugs and a wide assortment of other merchandise, which we call "front-end" products. In fiscal 2018, prescription drug sales accounted for 65.9% of our total drugstore sales. We believe that pharmacy operations will continue to represent a significant part of our business due to industry trends such as an aging population, increased life expectancy, anticipated growth in the federally funded Medicare Part D prescription program as "baby boomers" continue to enroll and the discovery of new and better drug therapies. We carry a full assortment of front-end products, which accounted for the remaining 34.1% of our total drug store sales in fiscal 2018. Front-end products include over-the-counter medications, health and beauty aids, personal care items, cosmetics, household items, food and beverages, greeting cards, seasonal merchandise and numerous other everyday and convenience products. 
         We differentiate our stores from other national chain drugstores, in part, through our wellness+ Rewards loyalty program, our Wellness format stores, innovative merchandising, private brands and our strategic partnership with GNC, a leading retailer of vitamin and mineral supplements. We offer a wide variety of products through our portfolio of private brands, which contributed approximately 18.7% of our front-end sales in fiscal 2018. 
         The average size of each store in our chain is approximately 13,600 square feet, and average store size is larger for our locations in the western United States. As of March 3, 2018, 60% of our stores were freestanding; 53% of our stores included a drive-thru pharmacy; and 59% included a GNC store within a Rite Aid store. 
         RediClinic, based in Houston and acquired by Rite Aid in April 2014 as a 100 percent owned subsidiary, is a leading operator of retail clinics. RediClinics are staffed by board certified nurse practitioners and physician assistants, who are trained and licensed to treat common conditions and provide preventative services, in collaboration with local physicians who are affiliated with a leading health care system in each market. Patients can be treated for more than 30 common medical conditions and RediClinic's clinicians are able to write prescriptions for these conditions when appropriate. Additionally, RediClinics provide a broad range of preventive services, including screenings, medical tests, immunizations and basic physical exams. 
         Health Dialog, a Boston-based 100 percent owned subsidiary that Rite Aid acquired in April 2014, is a provider of healthcare coaching and disease management services to health plans and employers. Health Dialog provides these services using a call in line staffed by nurse practitioners and through an on-line platform. 
         Pharmacy Services SegmentEnvisionRxOptions, a 100 percent owned subsidiary of Rite Aid, is a national, full-service PBM that also offers a broad range of pharmacy-related services. As a Rite Aid subsidiary, EnvisionRxOptions is a fully integrated provider with a differentiated approach to pharmacy benefits. EnvisionRx provides both transparent and traditional PBM options through its EnvisionRx and MedTrak PBM's, respectively. EnvisionRx's LakerSoftware provides a modern, scalable adjudication platform that powers both EnvisionRx and MedTrakRx, as well as other PBM's across the country that license this system. EnvisionRxOptions also offers fully integrated mail, specialty and compounding pharmacy services through EnvisionPharmacies; provides discounts for under and uninsured patients through EnvisionSavings; and serves one of the fastest growing demographics in healthcareseniors enrolled in Medicare Part Dthrough EnvisionInsurance and its national prescription drug plan, EnvisionRxPlus.

     Industry Trends 
         The rate of pharmacy sales growth in the United States has slowed in recent years, driven by a decline in new blockbuster drugs, a longer FDA approval process, drug safety concerns, higher copays and an increase in the use of generic (non-brand name) drugs, which are less expensive but generate higher gross margins. New drug development in the next few years is expected to be concentrated in specialty prescriptions, which are targeted toward a specific disease state. These drugs are often complex and expensive. We expect prescription usage to continue to grow in the coming years due to the aging U.S. population, increased life expectancy, "baby boomers" continuing to become eligible for the federally funded Medicare prescription program and new drug therapies. Additionally, rising U.S. healthcare costs and the shortage of primary care physicians are creating opportunities for pharmacists and drugstores to play a more active role in driving positive health outcomes for patients. Services such as immunizations, medication therapy management, chronic condition management, clinics and medication compliance counseling extend our efforts well beyond filling prescriptions. We believe that offerings such as these could gain additional momentum in a rapidly changing healthcare environment. 
         In terms of our traditional drug dispensing business, generic prescription drugs continue to help lower overall costs for customers and third party payors. We believe the utilization of existing generic pharmaceuticals will continue to increase, although the pace of introduction of new generic drugs is expected to slow. The gross profit from a generic drug prescription in the retail drugstore industry is generally greater than the gross profit from a brand drug prescription. However, the sale amount can be substantially less and can impact our overall revenues and same store sales. 
         The retail drugstore industry is highly competitive and consolidation has accelerated. We believe that the competitive advantages from the increasing trend toward vertical integration resulting from the combination of retail pharmacy companies with pharmacy benefit managers, such as CVS Health, and aggressive generic pricing programs at competitors such as Wal-Mart and various supermarket chains will further increase competitive pressures in the industry. Front end product pricing has continued to be highly promotional in the retail drugstore business, which contributes to additional competitive pressures. 
         The retail drugstore industry relies significantly on third party payors. Third party payors, including the Medicare Part D plans and the state-sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid agencies, at times change the eligibility requirements of participants or reduce certain reimbursement rates. These changes and reductions are expected to continue. Medicare Part D plans have also introduced plans that have restricted network options, under which a patient can elect a plan with a lower copay in exchange for the choice to use a limited number of pharmacies to fill their prescriptions. In order to participate in these restricted networks, retail pharmacies generally have to accept lower reimbursement rates. We expect the usage of these restricted network plans to continue to increase. When third party payors, including the Medicare Part D program and state-sponsored Medicaid agencies, reduce the number of participants and/or reduce their reimbursement rates, sales and margins in the industry could be reduced, and profitability of the industry adversely affected. These possible adverse effects can be partially offset by lowering our product cost, controlling expenses, dispensing more higher margin generics, finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services and dispensing more prescriptions overall. 
   Strategy 
         In fiscal 2018 we made significant progress in ensuring that we have sustainable economics for filling prescriptions. We engaged with our payor partners to gain better reimbursement rate predictability and access and we have begun the process of exploring how to best manage our pharmacy purchasing costs long-term. As we continue these efforts and work to complete our proposed merger with Albertsons, in fiscal 2019 we will also focus on further expanding the clinical role of our 
 8

   pharmacists; further integrating our three subsidiaries and network of Rite Aid stores; and growing front-end sales and prescription count while controlling costs. 
         Following are descriptions of some of our key initiatives: 
  Expanded Healthcare ServicesIn fiscal 2018, we continued to expand the role of our Rite Aid pharmacists in delivering wellness services that go beyond filling prescriptions. A key area of focus has been our immunizations program, which has grown significantly in recent years. In fiscal 2018, our pharmacists administered an all-time company record of 4.4 million immunizations, including more than 2.7 million shots from continuing operations. Immunizations will continue to be a key priority in fiscal 2019 as we continue promoting the value of immunizations that protect against conditions like influenza, shingles, pneumonia and whooping cough. 
         At the same time, helping our patients take their medications as prescribed continues to be a critical opportunity to improve their health and wellness while also lowering healthcare costs by avoiding illnesses and hospital visits. To support our ongoing efforts, we've launched One Trip Refills in Fiscal 2017, which allows our patients to refill all of their monthly maintenance medications by making a single trip to the pharmacy. The program has been well received by our patients, and when combined with our existing services to send alerts via text message, e-mail or phone when a prescription is ready to be picked up, it creates a more patient-friendly experience for our Rite Aid customers. 
         An important part of our retail healthcare strategy continues to be finding ways to integrate our expanded suite of healthcare assets with our base of conveniently located retail pharmacies to deliver a higher level of care and service in our communities. This includes leveraging our store base and the capabilities of EnvisionRxOptions in our efforts to create compelling pharmacy offerings across retail, specialty and mail-order channels; deliver cost-effective solutions to employers and health plans; and drive growth. When combined with Rite Aid's retail platform, EnvisionRxOptions' comprehensive suite of services allows Rite Aid to provide additional value and broader choice to customers, patients and payors and will better position us to meet their needs. 
         Our Pharmacy Services segment's business strategy centers on providing innovative pharmaceutical solutions and quality client service in order to help improve clinical outcomes for our clients' plan members while assisting our clients and their plan members in better managing overall health care costs. Our clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Managed Medicaid plans, Medicare plans, and other sponsors of health benefit plans, and individuals throughout the United States. Our goal is to produce superior results for our clients and their plan members by leveraging our expertise in core PBM services, including: plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order, specialty pharmacy services, retail pharmacy network management services, clinical services, disease management services, and other spend management. During fiscal 2018, EnvisionRxOptions made significant progress in Medicare Part D enrollment by adding approximately 188,000 new lives year-over-year as of January 2018 in this fast-growing segment. 
         RediClinic also represents a key component of our efforts to expand Rite Aid's retail healthcare offering. As of March 3, 2018, we had 39 RediClinics operating in Rite Aid stores throughout the Philadelphia, Seattle and New Jersey markets. Including our locations in Texas, we operated a total of 75 RediClinics at the end of fiscal 2018. 
  wellness+ RewardsSince the launch of wellness+ in April 2010, our loyalty program has provided customers with the opportunity to earn significant discounts and wellness rewards in return for being loyal Rite Aid shoppers. Enrolled members earn rewards based on the accumulation of points for certain front-end and prescription purchases. The program has been well received by Rite Aid customers and continues to provide significant value to members earning enough points to reach the Gold or Silver tier levels. Gold members, for example, receive a tiered discount of 20-percent off most 
 9

   non-pharmacy purchases for an entire year. In addition, all members receive exclusive sale pricing and wellness rewards. 
         Bonus Cash has been incorporated into wellness+ to create wellness+ Rewards. Members continue to earn wellness+ points toward various benefits at Rite Aid including discounts of up to 20% off storewide, exclusive sale prices and 24/7 access to a pharmacist. Members are also able to earn Bonus Cash points whenever they make qualifying purchases at Rite Aid that can be redeemed for future savings. Customers have 60 days to use their Bonus Cash points before expiration. 
         We currently have over 13 million customers enrolled in wellness+ Rewards. In addition, over 60% of transactions at Rite Aid now involve a wellness+ Rewards card. 
  Wellness Store RemodelsIn fiscal 2018, we continued to strengthen Rite Aid as a wellness destination by completing additional Wellness store remodels. As a result, our total number of Wellness stores reached 1,649 by the end of the fiscal year, which means that over 64% of all Rite Aid stores are now Wellness stores. We also opened 2 new stores and did 14 relocations, all in our groundbreaking Wellness format, which offers improved interior design, expanded clinical pharmacy services, innovative merchandising and new wellness product offerings. Our customers have responded favorably to this unique store format, with our Wellness stores continuing to outperform the rest of our chain in terms of both front-end same store sales and same store prescription count growth. 
         We plan to complete 132 additional Wellness remodels in fiscal 2019 along with 3 relocations and 2 new store openings. We believe these efforts represent a cost-effective way to strengthen our store base, grow sales and offer our customers an engaging wellness experience. 
  Prescription File PurchasesIn fiscal 2018, we spent $28.9 million on the purchase of prescription files. This represented a decrease in spend from previous years, as the proposed merger with WBA limited our file buy opportunities. We plan to increase our level of prescription file purchases in fiscal 2019 as they typically deliver a strong return on investment. 
         Drug Purchasing and Distribution EfficienciesIn fiscal 2018, we continued to partner with McKesson for pharmaceutical purchasing and distribution. Under this arrangement, McKesson assumes responsibility for purchasing all of the brand and generic medications that we dispense in our stores as well as delivering those medications to our over 2,500 store locations. This drug purchasing and distribution arrangement helps us manage product costs and working capital while optimizing in-stock positions in our stores. 
  Cost ControlIn fiscal 2019, we will continue to look for ways to control our costs in order to help mitigate the impact that declining reimbursement rates has on our business. Our cost control initiatives include store and field labor efficiency and initiatives to drive down circular costs. Our centralized indirect procurement group will continue to target not-for-resale purchasing opportunities. 
   Products and Services 
         Sales of prescription drugs for our Retail Pharmacy segment represented approximately 65.9%, 66.0% and 66.9% of our total drugstore sales in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, prescription drug sales were $10.3 billion, $11.1 billion and $11.3 billion, respectively. See "Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our consolidated financial statements. 
         We carry a full assortment of non-prescription, or front end, products. The types and number of front end products in each store vary, and selections are based on customer needs and preferences and 
 10

   available space. No single front end product category contributed significantly to our sales during fiscal 2018. Our Retail Pharmacy segment's principal classes of products in fiscal 2018 were the following: 

   
Product Class | Percentage of Sales | 
Prescription drugs | | 65.9 | %
Over-the-counter medications and personal care | | 10.9 | %
Health and beauty aids | | 4.4 | %
General merchandise and other | | 18.8 | %


        We offer a wide variety of products under our private brands to meet the needs of our customers in virtually every non-pharmacy department. We intend to increase our private brand sales and penetration in fiscal 2019 by expanding our product lines, refreshing the package design, along with fully leveraging our Wellness+ database and in-store marketing. We believe that our assortment is differentiated and a compelling value to our customers based on our emphasis on high quality standards and everyday/promotional pricing. 
         We have a strategic alliance with GNC under which we have opened over 1,507 GNC stores within Rite Aid stores as of March 3, 2018 and have a contractual commitment to open at least 78 additional GNC stores within Rite Aid stores by December 2019. We incorporate the GNC stores within Rite Aid stores concept into many of our new and relocated stores and into many of our Wellness remodels. GNC is a leading nationwide retailer of vitamin and mineral supplements, personal care, fitness and other health-related products. 
         Through our 100 percent owned subsidiary, EnvisionRx, we offer a broad range of pharmacy-related services. In addition to its transparent and traditional PBM offerings through the EnvisionRx and MedTrak PBMs, EnvisionRx also offers fully integrated mail-order and specialty pharmacy services through EnvisionPharmacies. Through its Envision Insurance Company, EnvisionRx also serves one of the fastest-growing demographics in healthcare: seniors enrolled in Medicare Part D. In addition, EnvisionRx, through its state of the art Laker Software, performs prescription adjudication services for its own as well as other PBM's. 
         The Company, through its Health Dialog subsidiary, provides health care coaching and disease management services to health plans and employers. Health Dialog provides these services using a call in line staffed by nurse practitioners and through an on-line platform. 
   Technology 
         All of our stores are integrated into a common information system, which enables our customers to fill or refill prescriptions in any of our stores throughout the country, reduces chances of adverse drug interactions, and enables our pharmacists to fill prescriptions more accurately and efficiently. Our customers may also order prescription refills over the Internet through our website, www.riteaid.com, our mobile app, or over the phone through our telephonic automated refill systems for pick up at a Rite Aid store. We have automated pharmacy dispensing units in high volume stores, which are linked to our pharmacists' computers that fill and label prescription drug orders. We developed central fill technology to facilitate the automated picking, packaging, and labeling of prescriptions in a central filling location, which are sent to certain retail stores for delivery to the customer. We have also developed workload sharing technology within our stores, whereby stores within a close proximity can shift filling volume to stores with excess capacity. The efficiency of these processes allows our pharmacists to spend more time consulting with and answering our customers' questions and concerns about their prescription medications and health conditions. Additionally, each of our stores employs point-of-sale technology that supports sales analysis and recognition of customer trends. This same point-of-sale technology facilitates the maintenance of perpetual inventory records which, together with our sales analysis, drives our automated inventory replenishment process. 
 11

           We continue to embrace technology as a way to enhance the customer experience. Our mobile app, which is available for download for both the Android and iPhone platforms, allows our customers to use their smartphones to manage their wellness + account, refill prescriptions, access the weekly circular to view sale items, and locate a nearby Rite Aid store. We have continued to strengthen our presence on social media sites through unique promotions and contests. 
   Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
         Beginning in fiscal 2015, under our pharmaceutical purchasing and delivery arrangement ("Purchasing and Delivery Arrangement") with limited exceptions, we purchased all of our branded pharmaceutical products and almost all of our generic (non-brand name) pharmaceutical products from McKesson Corporation ("McKesson"). If our relationship with McKesson were disrupted, we could temporarily have difficulty filling prescriptions for branded and generic drugs until we executed a replacement wholesaler agreement or developed and implemented self-distribution processes. 
         We purchase our non-pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers. We believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the non-pharmaceutical merchandise we carry and that the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on our business. 
         We sell private brand and co-branded products that generally are supplied by numerous competitive sources. The Rite Aid and GNC co-branded PharmAssure vitamin and mineral supplement products and the GNC branded vitamin and mineral supplement products that we sell in our stores are developed by GNC, and along with our Rite Aid brand vitamin and mineral supplements, are manufactured by GNC. 
   Customers and Third Party Payors 
         During fiscal 2018, our stores filled approximately 177.4 million prescriptions and served an average of 1.2 million customers per day. The loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
         In fiscal 2018, substantially all of our pharmacy sales were to customers covered by third party payors (such as insurance companies, prescription benefit management companies, government agencies, private employers or other managed care providers) that agree to pay for all or a portion of a customer's eligible prescription purchases based on negotiated and contracted reimbursement rates. During fiscal 2018, the top five third party payors accounted for approximately 78.6% of our pharmacy sales. The largest third party payor, Caremark, represented 27.2% of our pharmacy sales. 
         During fiscal 2018, Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid payors sales were approximately 20.4% of our pharmacy sales, of which the largest single Medicaid payor was approximately 1.9% of our pharmacy sales. During fiscal 2018, approximately 34.1% of our pharmacy sales were to customers covered by Medicare Part D. 
         Through our Pharmacy Services segment we provide innovative pharmaceutical solutions for our clients which are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Managed Medicaid plans, Medicare plans, and other sponsors of health benefit plans, and individuals throughout the United States. 
   Competition 
         The retail drugstore industry is highly competitive. We compete with, among others, retail drugstore chains, independently owned drugstores, supermarkets, mass merchandisers, discount stores, wellness offerings, dollar stores and mail order pharmacies. We compete on the basis of store location and convenient access, customer service, product selection and price. We believe continued 
 12

   consolidation of the drugstore industry, and the aggressive discounting of generic drugs by supermarkets and mass merchandisers will further increase competitive pressures in the industry. 
   Marketing and Advertising 
         In fiscal 2018, marketing and advertising expense was approximately $161.8 million, which was spent primarily on our weekly circular (print and digital), our wellness+ Rewards program/customer relationship marketing (CRM), digital marketing and focused pharmacy marketing initiatives including television, radio and direct mail. Our marketing and advertising activities are primarily focused on the following:


 Promotional marketing (circular/digital marketing) to drive share of wallet and new customer acquisition; 
 Our wellness + Rewards loyalty program, which benefits our members in several
ways: 


 Members earn wellness+ points for certain front-end and prescription purchases that qualify for savings of up to 20% off of
front-end purchases every day for a year 
 Bonus Cash rewards provide additional savings to our customers/wellness+ members every week 
 Personalized offers distributed in vehicles such as email and direct mail 

 Emphasis on the value of our private brand products; 
 Support of specific market-wide initiatives and individual store programs such as competitor market intrusion, prescription file buys and grand
openings for new and remodeled stores; and 
 Focused efforts on our digital marketing, which includes our Rite Aid app, social media, our riteaid.com website and e-commerce. 

         Our mission is to be the customer's first choice for health and wellness products, services and information. Under our "With Us It's Personal" tagline, we are focused on educational programs on what matters most to our customers, such as our wellness+ diabetes program and other pharmacy/clinical services to drive brand preference including our One Trip Refills, Vaccine Central and Quit For You smoking cessation programs. We believe all of these programs will help us improve customer loyalty and engagement, along with our ability to grow share of wallet and lifetime value. 
   Associates 
         We believe that our relationships with our associates are good. As of March 3, 2018, we had approximately 59,000 Retail Pharmacy segment associates: 11% were pharmacists, 42% were part-time and 35% were represented by unions. Additionally, we have approximately 1,800 Pharmacy Services segment associates. Associate satisfaction is critical to our success. Annually we survey our associates to obtain feedback on various employment-related topics, including job satisfaction and their understanding of our core values and mission. 
         The number of graduates from U.S. Schools of Pharmacy is largely meeting our workforce demand. However, pharmacist employment opportunities still exist in certain areas. 
   Research and Development 
         We do not make significant expenditures for research and development. 
 13

     Licenses, Trademarks and Patents 
         The Rite Aid name is our most significant trademark and the most important factor in marketing our stores and private brand products. We hold licenses to sell beer, wine and liquor, cigarettes and lottery tickets. As part of our strategic alliance with GNC, we have a license to operate GNC "stores-within-Rite Aid-stores." We also hold licenses to operate our pharmacies and our distribution facilities. Through our 100% owned subsidiary EnvisionRx, we hold a license to conduct Medicare Part D business with CMS. 
         Collectively, these licenses are material to our operations. 
   Seasonality 
         We experience moderate seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations concentrated in the first and fourth fiscal quarters as the result of the concentration of the cough, cold and flu season and the holidays. We tailor certain front end merchandise to capitalize on holidays and seasons. We increase our inventory levels during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the seasonal fluctuations described above. Our results of operations in the fourth and first fiscal quarters may fluctuate based upon the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, both of which are unpredictable. 
 Regulation 
         Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices concerning the provision of and payment for health care services, including, without limitation: federal, state and local licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plan regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims; the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "ACA"); regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, including regulations governing the purchase, sale, storing and dispensing of controlled substances and other products, as well as regulations promulgated by state and other federal agencies concerning automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, text messages and emails and the sale, advertisement and promotion of the products we sell, including tobacco and alcoholic beverages. 
         Our business is also subject to patient privacy and other obligations, including corporate, pharmacy and associate responsibility imposed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. As a covered entity, we are required to implement privacy standards, train our associates on the permitted uses and disclosures of protected health information, provide a notice of privacy practice to our pharmacy customers and permit pharmacy customers to access and amend their records and receive an accounting of disclosures of protected health information. We are also subject to federal and state privacy and data security laws with respect to our receipt, use and disclosure by us of personally identifiable information, which laws require us to provide appropriate privacy and security safeguards for such information. In addition, we are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard promulgated by the payment card industry in connection with handling credit card data. This standard contains requirements devised to aid entities that process, store or transmit credit card information to maintain a secure environment. 
         We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with our associates, including health and safety, minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, equal employment opportunity and unionizing efforts. 
         In addition, in connection with the ownership and operations of our stores, distribution centers and other sites, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and 
 14

   health and safety matters, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contaminated sites. 
         We are subject to federal, state, and local statutes and regulations, which govern PBM operations. In addition, certain quasi-regulatory organizations, including the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning PBMs and/or PBM activities. Similarly, credentialing organizations such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance ("NCQA") and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission ("URAC") may establish voluntary standards regarding PBM or specialty pharmacy activities. While the actions of these quasi-regulatory or standard-setting organizations do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for PBM or specialty pharmacy services. Moreover, any standards established by these organizations could also impact health plan clients and/or the services provided to them. PBMs also operate within the governance set forth by the Medicare Part D program, which makes prescription drug coverage available to eligible Medicare beneficiaries through private insurers.
