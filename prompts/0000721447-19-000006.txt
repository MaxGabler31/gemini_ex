Item 1. BUSINESS
 (a) General
CCA INDUSTRIES, INC. (hereinafter, “CCA” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware in 1983. CCA does business under the trade name Core Care America.
The Company operates in one industry segment, in what may be generally described as fast moving consumer goods, selling numerous products in multiple health-and-beauty aids, over the counter drug and remedies and cosmeceutical categories. All of the Company’s products are manufactured by contract manufacturers, pursuant to the Company’s specifications and formulations.
The Company owns registered trademarks, or exclusive licenses to use registered trademarks, that identify its products by brand-name. Under most of the brand names, the Company markets several different but categorically-related products. The principal brand and trademark names include “Plus+White” (oral health-care products),“Sudden Change” (skin-care products), “Nutra Nail” (nail treatments), “Bikini Zone” (pre and after-shave products), "Porcelana" (skin-care products), “Hair Off” (depilatories), “Sunset Cafe” (perfumes), “Lobe Miracle” (ear-care product) and “Scar Zone” (scar diminishing cream).
All Company products are marketed and sold to major drug, food chains, mass merchandisers and wholesale beauty aids distributors throughout the United States, as well as internet sales. In addition, certain of the Company’s products are sold internationally, through distributors.
The Company recognizes sales at the time its products are shipped to customers. However, while sales are not formally subject to any contract contingency, returns are accepted if it is in the best interests of the Company’s relationship with the customer. The Company thus estimates ‘unit returns’ based upon a review of the market’s recent-historical acceptance of subject products as well as current market-expectations, and calculates its reserves for estimated returns based on the historical returns as a percentage of sales in the three preceding months, adjusting for returns that can be put back into inventory, and a specific reserve based on customer circumstances, (See "Revenue Recognition" in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements). Of course, there can be no precise going-forward assurance in respect to return rates and gross margins, and a significant increase in the rate of returns could have a materially adverse effect upon the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
The Company’s net sales in fiscal 2018 were $16,595,499. Gross profit was $10,062,159. International sales accounted for approximately 8.8% of net sales. The Company had a net loss of $3,321,766 for fiscal 2018. Total shareholders' equity at November 30, 2018 was $8,302,654.
Including the principal members of management (see Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance), the Company, at November 30, 2018, had a total of 14 employees in the areas of sales, administrative, marketing, accounting, and operations.
(b) Manufacturing and Shipping
The Company creates and/or oversees formulations and arranges with independent contractors for the manufacture of its products pursuant to Company specifications. During fiscal 2018, the Company had research and development costs of $62,989 as compared to $58,920 in fiscal 2017. Manufacturing and component-supply arrangements are maintained with various manufacturers and suppliers. The Company has moved most of its manufacturing to be "turn-key", with the contract manufacturer supplying the Company with a finished good. A small amount of manufacturing requires the Company to purchase components and packaging material that are then supplied to the contract manufacturer. All order processing, invoicing, deduction management and accounts receivable collections were outsourced to Advantage Sales and Marketing. The Company also signed a contract with Casestack, 
Inc. ("Casestack"), a supply chain management company, who warehouses the Company's inventory and ship orders to the Company's customers. The Casestack warehouse is located in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
(c) Marketing
The Company markets its products to major drug, food and mass-merchandise retail chains, warehouse clubs and leading wholesalers, through independent sales representatives throughout the United States, and through distributors internationally.
The Company sells its products to approximately 250 accounts, most of which have numerous outlets. Approximately 40,000 stores carry at least one Company product (SKU). During the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018, the Company’s largest customers were Wal-Mart (approximately 41.5% of net sales), Walgreens (approximately 16.3%) and Target (approximately 10.4%). The loss of any of these principal customers, or substantial reduction of sales revenues realized from their business, could materially and negatively affect the Company’s earnings.
Most of the Company’s products are not particularly susceptible to seasonal-sales fluctuation. However, retail sales of depilatory and shave products customarily peak in the spring and summer months.
The Company works with external resources to create media advertising, packaging and point-of-purchase displays.
The Company primarily utilizes national cable and satellite television advertisements to promote its leading brands. In addition, and on a generally continuous basis, store-centered product promotions are cooperatively undertaken with customers.
Each of the Company’s brand-name products is intended to attract a particular demographic segment of the consumer market, and advertising campaigns are directed to the respective market-segments. The Company targets the following demographic segments and utilizes these specific marketing approaches for each of these core brands:
Bikini Zone: Designed to help women relieve the bumps, irritation and redness that can accompany hair removal in the bikini area, the brand is targeted primarily to women aged 18-35 years who remove body hair. Sales volume is seasonal with peak volume occurring between Memorial Day and the July 4th holiday as people prepare for outdoor activity and the swimming season. Marketing efforts are concentrated around this peak season and include in-store displays and secondary placement.
Porcelana: Designed to help treat skin discoloration, including dark spots, sun spots and hyperpigmentation, the brand is marketed to women aged 25-54 years.
Plus White:  Designed to help consumers whiten their teeth and maintain good oral hygiene, the brand is targeted primarily to women aged 25-54 years, and secondarily to men aged 25-54 years who are concerned about the health and appearance of their teeth. Marketing efforts include national television advertising, in-store displays and secondary placement, and in-pack cross-promotional coupons throughout the year.
Sudden Change: Designed to help women look their best by reducing the appearance of these signs of aging: wrinkles, dark circles, and dullness. Sudden Change brand is targeted primarily to women, aged 34 years and older. Marketing efforts include national TV advertising, in-store displays and in-pack cross-promotional coupons. 
Funston Media Management, which is owned by Lance Funston, the Company's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for the placement of its media advertising (see Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions for further information on Funston Media Management). 
(d) “Wholly-Owned” Products
The majority of the Company’s sales revenues are from sales of the Company’s “wholly-owned” product lines (i.e., products sold under trademark names owned by the Company, and not subject to any other party’s interest or license), which include principally “Plus+White”, “Sudden Change”, “Bikini Zone”, “Sunset Cafe”, and “Scar Zone”.
(e) All Products
During the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018, the Company’s net sales by category percentage were: Skin Care 59.3%; Oral Care 34.2%; Fragrance 4.2%; and Miscellaneous 2.3%.
(f) License-Agreements Products
i. Inspired Beauty Brands, Inc. (formerly Alleghany Pharmacal Corporation) 
In 1986, the Company entered into a license agreement with Alleghany Pharmacal Corporation now known as Inspired Beauty Brands, Inc. (the "Inspired Beauty License"). The license agreement, which is for the exclusive rights to Nutra Nail, Hair Off, Properm and IPR-3 was amended in 2011. The Company no longer markets products under the Properm and IPR-3 brand names. The Inspired Beauty License agreement, as amended, requires the Company to pay a royalty rate of 2.5% on net sales of said licensed products, and a minimum royalty of $250,000 per annum. The license agreement was further amended to eliminate the minimum royalty payment effective July 1, 2016 and continuing until June 30, 2017. Concurrent during the period that eliminates the minimum royalty, the royalty rate was changed to 10.0% of gross sales. Effective November 30, 2017, the Company entered into two amended license agreements for the Hair Off and Nutra Nail brands, that permanently eliminates the minimum royalty and increase the royalty rate to 10.0% of gross sales. The amended license agreements are for a term of three years, with an option to extend for two additional one year terms. The Company also has an option to purchase the Hair Off and Nutra Nail brands for an amount equal to the greater of; (a) ten (10) times the annual royalty for the NutraNail and or Hair Off brands for the preceding twelve months, or (b) (i) $500,000 for the period November 30, 2017 through November 30, 2019; (ii) $750,000 for the period December 1, 2019 through November 30, 2020; (iii) $1,000,000 for the period December 1, 2020 through November 30, 2022; subject to the negotiation of a definitive purchase and sale agreement containing terms customary for transactions of such nature. The Company incurred royalties of $91,920 for Inspired Beauty Brands, Inc. for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018. 
ii. Ultimark Products, Inc.
On March 23, 2017, the Company entered into a license agreement (the “Agreement”) with Ultimark Products, Inc. (“Ultimark”) for the exclusive right to manufacture, market and sell the Porcelana brand of skin care products. The Company’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Lance Funston, is also the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Ultimark. Porcelana is designed to reduce dark spots and brighten the skin. Under the Agreement, the Company acquired the exclusive right and license to use the Porcelana brand, formulas, packaging designs and trademarks (collectively, the “Porcelana Brand”) in connection with the design, development, manufacture, advertising, marketing, promotion, offering, sale and distribution of Porcelana products worldwide. In addition, the Company purchased all good and saleable inventory of Porcelana products in Ultimark’s possession or control as of April 1, 2017 at Ultimark’s cost, without markup. The Agreement requires the Company to pay Ultimark a royalty of 10% on the gross sales of Porcelana products manufactured and sold under the Agreement. Royalties are payable quarterly, commencing the first fiscal quarter in which Porcelana products are sold pursuant to the Agreement. There is no minimum royalty for any period under the Agreement. In addition, the Company has the option to purchase the Porcelana Brand from Ultimark during the term of the Agreement for an amount not to exceed $3.2 million, subject to a fairness opinion. In the event of such purchase, the Agreement shall thereafter terminate and no further royalties or compensation will be due thereunder. The Agreement has a term of one year, effective March 1, 2017 and ending February 28, 2018. The Agreement may be renewed, at the Company’s option, for up to two additional one-year terms. The Company had renewed the Agreement for an additional one year term ending February 28, 2019 and has renewed the Agreement for an additional one year term ending February 28, 2020, which included a modification of the Agreement to replace the Company option to purchase the Porcelana Brand with a right of first refusal if a third party buyer offers to purchase the brand. In consideration of the change in the Agreement, Ultimark and the Company have 
mutually agreed to reduce the royalty rate from 10% to 8%, effective March 1, 2019. The Company incurred costs of $177,791 for the year ended November 30, 2018 for royalties under the Agreement. 
iii. Other Licenses
The Company is not party to any other license agreement that is currently material to its operations.
(g) Trademarks
The Company’s own trademarks and licensed-use trademarks serve to identify its products and proprietary interests. The Company considers these marks to be valuable assets. However, there can be no assurance, as a practical matter, that trademark registration results in marketplace advantages, or that the presumptive rights acquired by registration will necessarily and precisely protect the presumed exclusivity and asset value of the marks.
(h) Competition
The market for fast moving consumer goods, in general, is characterized by vigorous competition among producers, many of whom have substantially greater financial, technological and marketing resources than the Company. Major competitors such as Revlon, L’Oreal, Colgate-Palmolive, Coty, Unilever, and Procter & Gamble have the broadest-based public recognition of their products and are significantly larger than us. Moreover, a substantial number of other health-and-beauty aids manufacturers and distributors may also have greater resources than the Company. In order to successfully compete with larger and better funded brands, the Company employs a strategy of uncovering unmet niche needs within large categories, then developing products specifically designed to address those needs. Our marketing strategy seeks to employ highly efficient media buying and direct to consumer techniques to create awareness in the most cost efficient manner possible. 
(i) Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers
The Company does not manufacture any of its products and instead uses contract manufacturers to produce its products. In a few cases the Company provides raw materials and packaging materials to the contract manufacturer, but in most cases the contract manufacturer sells the Company a turn-key (complete) product. The Company's contract manufacturers produce product based on written purchase orders submitted which specify a quantity of product to be produced. The Company regularly evaluates potential relationships with alternate suppliers. If a particular contract manufacturer was unable to continue producing product for the Company, the Company believes that it could change to an alternate supplier, and depending upon the timing and particular circumstances, this change would not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business or operations. 
The Company does not have a written contract with any of the suppliers of its raw materials other than agreements specifying manufacturing quality standards. The suppliers of components and packaging materials fulfill orders based on a written purchase order specifying the quantity to be supplied. The Company purchases components and packaging from a variety of suppliers and is not dependent on any one supplier. The Company believes that the components and packaging used in its products are commonly available and that there is no material risk as to its ability to obtain future supplies of such materials. 
(j) Government Regulation
All of the products that the Company markets are subject or potentially subject to particular regulation by government agencies, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission, and various state and/or local regulatory bodies. In the event that any future regulations were to require new approval for any in-the-market products, or should require approval for any planned product, the Company would attempt to obtain the necessary approval and/or license, assuming reasonable and sufficient market expectations for the subject product. However, there can be no assurance, that Company efforts in respect of any future regulatory requirements would result in approvals and issuance of licenses. Moreover, if such license-requirement circumstances should arise, delays inherent in any application-and-approval process, as well as any refusal to provide approval, could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial condition and existing operations (i.e. concerning in-the-market products) or planned operations.
(k) Cost and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
 The costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws are not material to the Company.
