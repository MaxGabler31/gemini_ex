ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 At our core, we are a global services company. With over 90% market share in the historically highly attractive outsourced maritime health and wellness market, we are the market leader at nearly 20x the size of our closest maritime competitor. Over the last 50 years, we have built our leading market position on our depth of staff expertise; broad and innovative service and product offerings; expansive global recruitment, training and logistics platform; and decades-long relationships with cruise line and destination resort partners. Throughout our history, our mission has been simple: helping guests look and feel their best during and after their stay. We serve a critical role for our cruise line and destination resort partners, operating a complex and increasingly important aspect of their overall guest experience. Decades of investment and know-how have allowed us to construct an unmatched global infrastructure to manage the complexity of our operations. We have consistently expanded our onboard offerings with innovative, leading-edge service and product introductions, and developed a powerful back-end recruiting, training and logistics platform to manage our operational complexity, maintain our industry-leading quality standards and maximize revenue per center. The combination of our renowned recruiting and training platform, deep labor pool, global logistics and supply chain infrastructure and proven revenue management capabilities represents a significant competitive advantage that we believe is not economically feasible to replicate. These competitive advantages have served our business well during these extremely challenging times for our industry.
Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19)
 In the face of the global impact of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, our cruise line partners paused their guest cruise operations and the majority of our U.S. and Caribbean-based destination resort spas temporarily closed in mid-March 2020. During 2021, we initiated our resumption of spa operations on cruise ships and in destination resorts in a phased manner, in concert with our cruise line and resort partners. As of February 25, 2022, our health and wellness centers on 105 ships of our cruise line partners and in 48 destination resort spas were operating as part of our gradual return to service. 
 The extent of the effects of COVID-19 on our business is uncertain and will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and continued severity of COVID-19 and the length of time it takes to return the Company to profitability. The ongoing effects of COVID-19 have had, and will continue to have, a material negative impact on our financial results and liquidity. 
 We have implemented a number of proactive measures to mitigate the financial and operational impacts of COVID-19, including completing a private placement and various capital market transactions, reduction of capital expenditures and operating expenses, borrowing on our revolving credit facility, deferring payment of dividends declared and the suspension of our dividend program. To the extent necessary, we will continue to pursue other opportunities to improve our liquidity.
 Our Business
 The majority of our revenue and profits are earned through long-term revenue sharing agreements with cruise line partners that economically align both parties and contribute to our attractive asset-light financial profile. These agreements average approximately five years in length and provide us with the exclusive right to offer health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and the ability to sell complementary products onboard the ships we serve. Under these long-term agreements, cruise line partners retain a specified percentage of revenues from all our sales onboard. This inherent alignment encourages collaboration in all aspects of our operations, including facility design, product innovation, pre- and post-cruise sales opportunities, capacity utilization initiatives and other data-driven strategies to drive increased guest traffic and revenue growth. Most of our cruise line agreements encompass 100% of a partner cruise line’s existing fleet and all new ships introduced by the cruise line during the term of the agreement. As opposed to fixed-rent landlords, cruise lines and destination resorts serve as our aligned economic partners.
 We are recognized by our cruise line and destination resort partners and our guests for our comprehensive suite of services and products. We curate and deliver a broad range of offerings centered on providing specific health, fitness, beauty, and wellness solutions to meet our guests’ lifestyle routines or objectives. These services include: (i) traditional body, salon, and skin care services and products; (ii) self-service fitness facilities, specialized fitness classes and personal fitness training; (iii) innovative pain management, detoxifying programs and comprehensive body composition analyses; (iv) weight management programs and products; and (v) advanced medi-spa services, among others. We also offer our guests access to leading beauty and wellness brands including ELEMIS ®, Kérastase ® and Dysport ®, with many brands offered exclusively by us in the cruise market. On average, during normal operating conditions, including prior to the near cessation of our operations due to COVID-19, guests spend $230 per visit and our solution sales approach drives substantial retail sales, with approximately 25% of our revenues derived from the sale of retail products.
 Our state-of-the-art health, fitness, beauty and wellness centers are designed and branded for each cruise line and destination resort to optimize the guest experience, align with our partners’ overall hospitality atmosphere and maximize productivity. Centers can 
 2

employ up to 105 highly trained professionals and range in size from 200 to over 30,000 square feet, depending on the cruise line or destination resort partner’s needs.
 Our cruise line relationships average over 20 years and encompass substantially all of the major global cruise lines, including Carnival Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean Cruises, Princess Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Celebrity Cruises, Costa Cruises and Holland America, among many others. These partnerships extend across contemporary, premium, luxury and budget cruise lines that operate ships regionally and globally. We maintain what we believe to be an exceptional contract renewal rate with our cruise line partners, having renewed approximately 94% of our contracts based on ship count over the last 15 years, including 100% of our contracts with ships larger than 3,500 berths. We have not only maintained relationships with existing cruise line partners, but also have a history of winning contracts and gaining market share. In August 2021, we extended our current agreement with Azamara through May 2026. On land, we have longstanding relationships with the world’s leading destination hotel and resort operators, including Marriott, Hilton, Wyndham, Atlantis, ClubMed, Caesars Entertainment, Lotte, Loews, Four Seasons, and Mohegan Sun, among others.
 Our Operations and Performance
 We are a Bahamian international business company that earns a substantial portion of our revenue in low- or no-tax jurisdictions, benefitting from a comparatively low effective cash tax rate. Additionally, we have minimal capital expenditures, as our cruise line and destination resort partners typically fund the build-out, maintenance, and refurbishment of our health and wellness centers. The combination of our attractive tax rate and asset-light operating model leads to a financial profile that delivers comparatively high Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow. In fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, prior to the cessation of operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we converted approximately 90% of our Adjusted EBITDA to Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow.
 We have historically driven strong financial performance and believe our leading market position in a growing industry, differentiated business model and entrenched cruise line and destination resort partner relationships position our business for future growth. Due to the impact of COVID-19 on our operations in 2020 and 2021, current year data is not meaningful. However, for the year ended December 31, 2019, we achieved revenues of $562.2 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $59.0 million, Net Loss of $56.7 million and Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow of $55.4 million. 
 Attractive Market Opportunity
 
Despite the adverse conditions impacting global operations and economies resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, we continue to operate at the intersection of the historically attractive health and wellness and travel leisure industries. We believe we are well-positioned to grow as the cruise industry recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Historical Cruise Industry Growth
 
Prior to COVID-19, the cruise industry had been among the fastest-growing segments in the travel leisure industry, including through the recessions of 2001 and 2008-2010. We estimate, based on annual statistics published by Cruise Lines International Association (“CLIA”), that global passenger counts had grown every year until 2020 from approximately 6.3 million passengers in 1995 to an all-time high of approximately 30.0 million passengers in 2019, representing a compound annual growth rate of 6.7%. This passenger growth had been driven by consistent, significant investments in new cruise ship capacity, strong loyalty among experienced cruisers and the large and growing appeal of cruising to all demographics, including millennials. From 2018 to 2020, the Caribbean, Bahamas and Bermuda were the top cruise destinations, representing 44% of passenger volume during that period, according to the CLIA. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly adversely affected, and continues to affect, passenger volume in the global cruise industry, passenger volume has started to recover since a number of cruise lines restarted their operations beginning in July 2021. CLIA forecasts passenger volume to exceed 2019 levels by the end of 2023 and possibly by the end of 2022. Additionally, in a survey of international vacationers conducted by CLIA in connection with its 2022 State of the Cruise Industry Outlook, 80% of respondents who had previously been on a cruise said that they were likely to cruise again in the next few years, with millennials representing 85% of the cruise passenger respondents who plan to cruise again.
Historically Large and Growing Health and Wellness Industry
 
Our health and wellness centers cater to guests seeking a continuation of their health, fitness, beauty and wellness activities while traveling and those who want to trial services while away from home. As consumers increasingly incorporate health and wellness activities into their daily lives, they are placing a higher priority on health and wellness services while traveling and vacationing. According to CLIA, passenger volume in a baseline forecast on cruises is expected to surpass 2019 levels by the end of 2023, with passenger volume in an upside forecast projected to recover to 101% of 2019 levels by the end of 2022. Further, according to CLIA, the same percentage of travelers who have cruised before the pandemic say they will cruise again.

Our Evolution
 
Our history dates back to the early 1960’s, when we opened the world’s first salons at sea onboard transatlantic cruise ships, including the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth II. Over more than 50 years, we have continuously defined and redefined the onboard health, fitness, beauty and wellness category by consistently expanding our onboard offerings with innovative and leading-edge service and product introductions, while developing the powerful back-end recruiting, training and logistics platforms to manage and optimize the complexity of our operations and maintain our industry-leading quality standards. We have successfully evolved the onboard health, fitness, beauty and wellness category from what was once a consumer-centric amenity for passengers to a key onboard revenue driver for our cruise line partners.
 In 2015, a consortium led by L Catterton acquired Steiner Leisure, the holding company of OneSpaWorld at that time. Since then, OneSpaWorld has strengthened its already proven platform by leveraging L Catterton’s expertise in consumer services, consumer products, multi-unit retail operations and customer acquisition, among other expertise. OneSpaWorld has enhanced collaboration with its cruise line and destination resort partners to reinforce its market leading position and introduced innovative revenue initiatives to accelerate its revenue growth. Key recent initiatives include:

• | executing an effective return to service as our cruise line and destination resort partners resumed operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reopening our London Wellness Academy, which is integral to our status as a leader in training and certification;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continued innovation in our service and product offerings, coupled with enhanced consultative sales training techniques, resulting in a shifting revenue mix toward higher value-add and higher priced services, higher-priced products, and higher attachment rates for product purchases in connection with a guest service;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enhancing and expanding collaboration with cruise line and destination resort partners;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanding pre-marketing, pre-booking and pre-payment platforms with optimal positioning on cruise line websites;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | employing data-driven, dynamic pricing of services to optimize facility utilization and revenue generation; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | incorporating advanced direct marketing programs, including personalized communications and value promotions, to drive consumer demand.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On March 19, 2019 (the “Business Combination Date”), OneSpaWorld consummated a business combination pursuant to a Business Combination Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2018 (as amended on January 7, 2019, by Amendment No. 1 to the Business Combination Agreement), by and among Steiner Leisure Limited (“SLL”, “Steiner Leisure,” “Steiner,” or “Parent”), Steiner U.S. Holdings, Inc., Nemo (UK) Holdco, Ltd., Steiner UK Limited, Steiner Management Services, LLC, Haymaker Acquisition Corp. (“Haymaker”), OneSpaWorld, Dory US Merger Sub, LLC, Dory Acquisition Sub, Limited, Dory Intermediate LLC, and Dory Acquisition Sub, Inc. (the “Business Combination”), in which Haymaker acquired from Steiner operating business known as OSW Predecessor (“OSW”). Prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, OneSpaWorld was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Steiner Leisure. On the Business Combination Date, OneSpaWorld became the ultimate parent company of the Haymaker and OSW company. 
 Prior to the cessation of our cruise line and land-based destination resort operations due to COVID-19, our comprehensive suite of premium health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and products reached more consumers than ever before, with 175 centers onboard cruise ships addressing a captive audience of over 20 million passengers annually, and 68 destination resort centers serving global travelers at premier destination resorts around the world.
 Our Strengths
 
As noted above, we cannot yet fully predict the impacts of COVID-19 on the travel leisure industry or on our business. Despite this uncertainty, we believe that our competitive strengths historically have positioned us, and will continue to position us, as a leader in the hospitality-based health and wellness industry and the category dominant leader in the cruise industry.
 
Global Leader in the Hospitality-Based Health and Wellness Industry
 
As the pre-eminent global operator of health and wellness centers onboard cruise ships and a leading operator of health and wellness centers at destination resorts worldwide, we are at the center of the intersection between the health and wellness and travel leisure industries. In 2018, the Global Wellness Institute reported that global wellness tourism was a $639 billion industry. We command over 90% market share in the highly attractive outsourced maritime health and wellness market and we are nearly 20x the size of our closest competitor. Through our market share, we have had access to a captive audience of over 20 million passengers. 
 4

Cruise ship guests are an attractive demographic, with average annual household incomes of over $100,000. As a result of our scale, our captive consumer audience, and consumers’ increasing desire for more health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and products, we are well-positioned in the global health and wellness industry and have a large and highly attractive addressable consumer market at sea and on land.
 
Differentiated Business Model That Would Be Difficult and Uneconomic to Replicate
 
For more than 50 years, our business model has been built through investment in global infrastructure and training, decades-long relationships with our cruise line and destination resort partners and our reputation for offering our guests a best-in-class health, fitness, beauty and wellness experience. Our robust infrastructure and processes required to operate and maximize revenue across our network of global health and wellness centers separates us from our peers. In 2021, we embarked on over 2,000 voyages that welcomed over three million passengers at more than 73 ports of embarkation. Our business model is centered on providing our cruise line and destination resort partners with the following solutions:

• | Creating Extraordinary Guest Experiences —We pride ourselves on creating extraordinary guest experiences in our health and wellness facilities, offering our cruise line and destination resort partners’ guests a comprehensive suite of premium health, wellness, fitness and beauty services, treatments, and products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Global Recruiting, Training and Logistics —Prior to the near cessation of our operations due to COVID-19, we recruited, trained and managed over 3,000 health, fitness, beauty and wellness professionals annually around the world, representing 88 nationalities and 24 spoken languages. With seven global training facilities, we serve each cruise line’s needs for specific onboard staff with complex language, cultural and service modality requirements and are the only company with the infrastructure to commission highly trained staff at over 1,200 ports of call worldwide. Our commitment to our onboard and destination resort staff has proven to be an essential element of our successful return to service performance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supply Chain and Logistics —We manage the complex delivery of all products and supplies to our health and wellness centers onboard vessels operating itineraries around the world, leveraging proprietary data to accurately forecast and stock each health and wellness center. Products and supplies can only be loaded at designated ports around the world during a limited window of time while the ship is in port, in many cases overnight, adding to the complexity of the process.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Yield and Revenue Management —We have developed proprietary technology, processes and staff training tools to consistently measure, analyze and maximize onboard and destination resort revenue and profitability.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exclusive Relationships with Global Brands —Due to our scale, superior operations, industry longevity and attractive captive consumer audience, prior to the near cessation of our operations due to COVID-19, we had over 1,100 product SKUs sourced from over 75 vendors offered through the OneSpaWorld platform at sea, including ELEMIS, Kérastase, Thermage ®, GoodFeet ® Arch Supports and GO SMILE ® Teeth Whitening.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Facility Design and Branding Expertise —We design our state-of-the-art health and wellness centers specifically for each cruise line vessel and destination resort, creating bespoke branding, guest experience, guest services offerings, complementary retail products assortment, and competitive differentiation for each of our cruise line and destination resort partners to optimize guest experiences and maximize productivity and financial performance.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The above capabilities have contributed to building a differentiated and defensible strategy around our leading market position in a historically growing and attractive industry.
 Unmatched Breadth of Service and Product Offering
 
We offer our guests a comprehensive suite of health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and products to meet any and all of their needs. We are continuously innovating and evolving our offerings based on the latest trends and tailor our service and product offerings to regional preferences. In addition to conventional services, we offer the latest in fitness, a full range of massage treatments, nutrition/weight management consultations, teeth whitening, and acupuncture, among a broad spectrum of personal care services. OneSpaWorld has also introduced innovative, higher-ticket medi-spa services at sea, including BOTOX ® Cosmetic, Dysport, Restylane ®, CoolSculpting ®, Thermage and dermal fillers, among others. With our captive audience of over 20 million cruise guests annually, OneSpaWorld is a compelling distribution channel for leading health, fitness, beauty and wellness brands. Renowned brands, including ELEMIS and Kérastase, have partnered with us for exclusive distribution at sea. Cruise line and destination resort partners depend on us to provide their guests with the best and broadest assortment of services and products to enhance their vacation experience and the competitive positioning and consumer value of their brands.

Entrenched Partnerships with Economic Alignment
 
We have cultivated partnerships with most of the largest and most reputable cruise lines and premier resorts in the world. Our cruise line relationships average over 20 years and encompass substantially all of the major global cruise lines, including Carnival Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean Cruises, Princess Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Celebrity Cruises, Crystal Cruises, Costa Cruises, Seabourn Cruise Line, Virgin Voyages, and Holland America, among many others. The majority of our revenues and profits are earned through our long-term revenue sharing agreements with our cruise line partners that economically align both parties and create a collaborative relationship. On land, we partner with market leaders at highly attractive destinations, including Atlantis Paradise Island Bahamas, The Ocean Club, a Four Seasons Resort, Hilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort and Spa, and the Mohegan Sun Resort, among others. Our long-standing relationships, with economic alignment at the core, strengthen our competitive advantage.
Highly Visible and Predictable Revenue Streams
 
Historically, we have had access to over 20 million passengers annually, with potential long-term passenger growth expected in the future, post the COVID-19 pandemic, as new ships are commissioned in the industry. This new ship growth is highly visible as demonstrated in a publicly available global order book outlining over five years of new ship orders. Across our contracts, OneSpaWorld typically operates on all ships in a fleet and on new ships added during the contract term, securing both existing and new ship revenue. A new ship requires approximately two to four years to be built and is rarely delayed, as cruise lines typically sell out the vessel’s maiden voyage over a year in advance. New ships do not have a revenue ramp-up period given these advanced marketing efforts. Our cruise line partners are experts at dependably filling their ships with passengers, as demonstrated by the industry’s historical average occupancy rate of above 100%, even through recessionary periods. Due to historically consistent industry practices and decades of proprietary operating history data, OneSpaWorld has had strong visibility into our future revenue realization for the next three to five years. Despite current market conditions related to COVID-19, we expect these revenue streams to rebound in the future to historical levels.
Asset-Light Model with After-Tax Free Cash Flow Generation
 
Third parties typically fund the build-out, maintenance, and refurbishment of our onboard health and wellness centers, resulting in an asset-light profile with minimal capex required. Our capital expenditures averaged 1% of revenues over the three years preceding the near cessation of our operations due to COVID-19. Being a Bahamian international business company and earning a significant portion of our revenue in low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions, including international waters, our effective cash tax rate had been approximately 1% over the three years preceding the near cessation of our operations due to COVID-19. This combination translates to exceptional after-tax free cash flow. Annually, from 2017 through 2019, we converted approximately 90% of our Adjusted EBITDA to Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow. 
Seasoned and Proven Leadership Team
 
OneSpaWorld is led by a management team that has operated the Company for nearly 20 years. Our Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Leonard Fluxman, and our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, Stephen Lazarus, together led OneSpaWorld's predecessor company, Steiner Leisure, as a public company for more than a decade. Mr. Fluxman and Mr. Lazarus now lead an internally developed senior management team with over 150 years of combined industry experience. 
 Additionally, our Chief Commercial Officer, Susan Bonner, has over 20 years of experience in the cruise line sector and is a seasoned executive with a proven track record and significant background in strategy, revenue management, operations management, sales, and marketing. We also benefit from Haymaker’s investing and operational experience at Fortune 500 companies, particularly in the consumer and hospitality sectors. The OneSpaWorld management team’s deep experience and proven track record in managing the business in both public and private markets positions OneSpaWorld as an attractive vehicle for future long-term growth within the global hospitality-based health and wellness industry.
 Growth Strategies
 Our management plans to continue growing the business through the following strategies:
 
Capture Highly Visible New Ship Growth with Current Cruise Line Partners
 
We expect to continue to benefit long-term from a return to the cruise industry’s capacity for growth, with a consistent and visible pipeline of new ships commissioned annually by our cruise line partners. By the end of 2023, our existing cruise line partners 
 6

are expected to introduce 23 new ships. Through established cruise line partner relationships, current contracts, and an approximately 94% contract renewal rate over the last 15 years, we are well-positioned to capture new ship growth over the long term.
 Expand Market Share by Adding New Potential Cruise Line Partners
 
Although we have over 90% market share in the outsourced maritime health and wellness market, there is an opportunity to continue to grow our market share by winning new contracts. We also routinely meet with cruise lines that do not currently outsource their health and wellness centers or utilize our smaller competitors, but that may have an interest in contracting with us in the future due to our strong reputation and historical results. As evidenced by our successful history of winning new contracts, we remain focused on continuing to protect and grow our dominant market share at sea.
Continue Launching More Value-Added Services and Products
 
We have successfully innovated services and products to meet guests’ ever-changing needs, attract more guests and generate more revenue per guest. Medi-spa has been a highly successful innovation for OneSpaWorld at sea and is now a critical component of our offerings. Performed by licensed physicians, the medi-spa offerings provide the latest cosmetic medical services to guests, such as non-surgical cosmetic procedures, including BOTOX Cosmetic, Dysport, Restylane, CoolSculpting, Thermage, and dermal fillers. Guests purchasing medi-spa services spend on average up to 10x more than on traditional health, beauty and wellness services. We continue to roll out incremental revenue opportunities, including the Capillus® Laser Therapy Cap and HypericeTM percussion and vibration therapy products and related services. We will continue to focus on launching higher value-add services and products that meet guest demands, align with and enhance our cruise line and destination resort partner brands, optimize health and wellness center utilization, and maximize center-level profitability.
Focus on Enhancing Health and Wellness Center Productivity
 
Cruise lines have become increasingly focused on growing onboard revenue as a way to enhance revenue beyond traditional cabin ticket sales. Between 2013 and 2019, onboard spend on the three largest cruise operators we serve increased by $2.6 billion, from $6.5 billion to $9.1 billion. According to an independent global consulting study, 45% of passengers say they are interested in using our health and wellness centers onboard. We are focused on collaborating with cruise line partners to increase passenger penetration and maximize revenue yield through the following initiatives:

• | Increase Pre-Booking and Pre-Payment Capture Rate —We are working with our cruise line partners to expand our marketing efforts to engage guests upon booking their vacation experience, well before boarding a ship, through pre-booking. Pre-booked appointments can yield approximately 30% more revenue than services booked onboard the ship. Due to our success across select cruise lines that have implemented pre-booking capabilities, we are in the process of implementing pre-booking across additional partner cruise lines.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Targeted Marketing and Promotion Initiatives —We are now directly marketing and distributing promotions to onboard passengers as a result of enhanced collaboration with select cruise line partners. These promotions are personalized and individually tailored to guests’ profiles and have successfully driven traffic and revenue at our health and wellness centers. Examples include “happy anniversary” messages to couples, “happy birthday” notes to individual guests, and promotional retail credits offered to guests who visit our centers before the end of their cruise. Guests that received these customized promotions were responsible for approximately 8% of revenues generated during the year ended December 31, 2021.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utilize Technology to Increase Utilization and Enhance Service Mix —We have recently begun to successfully introduce and expand technology-enabled dynamic pricing initiatives with selected cruise line partners. While dynamic pricing strategies have historically been applied manually by onboard staff, we are currently rolling out online and pre-cruise access to drive off-peak utilization rates and fill higher-demand time slots with higher-value bookings. This enhanced dynamic pricing capability is currently available with only a few cruise line partners, representing a significant opportunity for revenue growth as it is rolled out and optimized fleet-wide.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extend Retail Beyond the Ship —Our Shop & Ship program provides guests the ability to buy retail products onboard and have products shipped directly to their home to avoid the hassle of packing products in their luggage. On average, a Shop & Ship customer spends more than 3.5x the amount of a non-Shop & Ship customer on retail products. The Shop & Ship program, combined with our e-commerce platform timetospa.com, gives us the ability to maintain a connection with each guest beyond the cruise voyage.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Health and Wellness Services
 
We curate and deliver an ever-innovating broad range of offerings for our cruise line and destination resort partners, centered around a holistic wellness approach, which includes:

• | Spa and Beauty. We offer massages and a broad variety of other body and beauty treatments including facials, hair cutting and styling, manicures and pedicures, and tanning. Additionally, we offer teeth whitening services in the majority of our onboard health and wellness centers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Medi-spa. We offer medi-spa services on the majority of our ships. Our service menu consists of the leading medi-spa brands, including BOTOX Cosmetic, Dysport, Restylane, CoolSculpting, Thermage, dermal fillers, and microneedling, among others. Medi-spa services are administered by certified medical physicians. Prior to the cessation of our operations due to COVID-19, medi-spa services were available on 99 ships. Subject to the continued resumption of operations by our cruise line partners, by the end of 2022, we expect to offer medi-spa services on 130 ships.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fitness. We offer guests use of fitness centers as well as paid services by a fitness professional to our cruise and destination resort guests. The fitness centers offer guests use of strength equipment, cardiovascular equipment such as treadmills, elliptical machines, exercise bicycles and rowing and stair machines. Boutique fitness classes, including yoga, Pilates, F45 Training, cycling, and aerobics, are also available to guests for a fee or at no charge, depending on the class. Our fitness instructors are available to provide paid services, such as body composition analysis and personal training.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Nutrition. In addition to fitness services, we offer guests paid services including personal nutritional and dietary advice, weight management, nutrition coaching and detoxification. Guests can begin a program on the cruise and remain connected to our professional coach after the cruise to ensure successful completion of the program, such as a nutrition or detoxification plan, including by continuing to purchase nutritional and detoxification products via or e-commerce platform timetospa.com.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Health. We first introduced acupuncture in 2005 and have since rapidly expanded our health and pain management, offerings to be one of our largest categories. Today, we offer acupuncture, electro acupuncture, cupping, posture and gait analysis, GoodFeet Arch Supports, physical therapy, and NormaTec ® recovery. Our services are enhanced by our retail channel; GoodFeet, a premium arch support insert, is now a leading retail product for us.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mind-Body and Wellness. We also offer our guests yoga, Tai Chi and sound therapy in addition to meditation and biofeedback.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Products
 
We sell over 1,100 branded product SKUs sourced from over 75 vendors due to our scale, superior operations, industry longevity and attractive captive audience at sea and on land. We sell products from leading brands, including ELEMIS, Thermage, Dysport, GoodFeet Arch Supports and GO SMILE Teeth Whitening. We have an exclusive 10-year supply agreement with ELEMIS. We believe we have a leading retail attachment rate based on the number of products purchased in conjunction with a service compared to the broader consumer personal care services and retail industry. During 2021, approximately 20% of our revenues come from product sales, enabling incremental revenue even at full treatment room utilization.
 
We utilize three warehouses, consisting of one 27,000 square foot bonded warehouse in Miami, FL, one 21,600 square foot warehouse in Miami, FL, and one 5,000 square foot warehouse in New Jersey. The Miami warehouses provide fulfillment services for cruise inventory, and the New Jersey warehouse provides fulfillment for e-commerce and the Shop & Ship program.
 
Health and Wellness Centers
 As of December 31, 2021, we operated state-of-the-art health and wellness centers on 170 ships, including virtually all of the major cruise lines globally, and 52 land-based destination resorts, principally in the United States, the Caribbean and Asia. Centers are designed and branded for each cruise and destination resort partner to optimize the guest experience, maximize revenues and align with our partners’ brand and hospitality environment. Centers can range in size from approximately 200 square feet to over 30,000 square feet and generally provide fitness areas, treatment rooms and salons, as well as elaborate thermal suites and/or saunas. Cruise centers are generally located on higher ship decks, which encourages increased passenger interest and guest traffic.

Facility Design
 
Our cruise line and destination resort partners each seek differentiated health and wellness experiences for their guests. As such, we provide design capabilities for our cruise line and destination resort partners, creating bespoke branding and design consulting to optimize guest experiences and maximize revenues. We operate health and wellness centers under proprietary brands of Mandara ® and Chavana ®, as well as brands curated specifically for each cruise line, complete with cruise line and/or ship-specific service menus. Prior to the near cessation of our operations due to COVID-19, as of December 31, 2019, we had 39 health and wellness centers under the Mandara brand, 11 centers under the Chavana brand, and one center under our destination resort health and wellness brand, “Glow ®, a Mandara Spa.”
Principal Cruise Line Customers
 A significant portion of our revenue is generated from each of the following cruise lines, which accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively: Carnival (including Carnival, Carnival Australia, Costa, Cunard, Holland America, P&O, Princess, and Seabourn cruise lines): 36.7%, 43.4%, and 46.7%, Royal Caribbean (including Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises, Pullmantur, Azamara and Silversea cruise lines): 22.8%, 20.9%, and 23.1%, and Norwegian Cruise Line (including Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises): 11.4%, 16.3%, and 14.7%. These companies, combined, accounted for 140 of the 170 ships served by OneSpaWorld as of December 31, 2021. Our contracts are signed at the cruise line-level, not with the parent operator, giving OneSpaWorld a diverse customer base despite parent-level consolidation. Our contracts average five years in duration.
 The numbers of ships served as of December 31, 2021 under cruise line agreements with the respective cruise lines are listed below:

Cruise Line and Destination Resort Agreements
 
Through our cruise line and destination resort agreements, we have the exclusive right to offer health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and the ability to sell complementary products onboard the ships and at the destination resorts we serve. Under the cruise line agreements, guests pay for our services through our cruise line partners, who retain a specified percentage of gross receipts from such sales before remitting the remainder to us. Our revenue share agreements result in a highly variable cost model, where the primary fixed costs are the meals and accommodations for our shipboard employees. Most of our cruise line agreements cover all of the then-operating ships of a cruise line and typically new ships are added to ships in service through an amendment to the agreement. The agreements have specified terms ranging from three to 10.7 years, with an average remaining term per ship of approximately 3.7 years as of December 31, 2021. Cruise lines can terminate the agreements with limited or no advance notice under certain circumstances, including, among other things, the withdrawal of a ship from the cruise trade, the sale or lease of a ship, or our failure to achieve specified passenger service standards. However, we have never had a contract terminated prior to our respective expiration date.
 
We operate our destination resort centers pursuant to agreements with the owners of the properties involved. Our destination resort centers generally are required to pay rent based on a percentage of our revenues, with others having fixed rents. Some of our destination resort center agreements also require that we make minimum rental payments irrespective of the amount of our revenues. The terms of the agreements for our destination resort centers generally range from five to 20 years (including the terms of renewals available at our option). In the U.S. and Caribbean, destination resort centers generally have a higher investment cost and lower revenue share with higher staff costs and contracts lasting ten years on average. In Asia, destination resort centers have lower investment cost, higher revenue share, lower staff costs, and contracts averaging five years.
 
Marketing and Promotion
 
We promote our services and products to cruise passengers and destination resort guests through targeted marketing, including pre-and post-cruise emails, website advertising, on-site demonstrations and seminars, video presentations shown on in-cabin/in-room television, ship newsletters, tours of our centers, and dedicated signage around the ship. We also encourage our employees to cross-sell, as they believe that such cross-promotional activities frequently result in our customers purchasing services and/or products in addition to those they initially contemplated buying. For example, we cross-sell our fitness body assessment with detox programs, vitamins, and seaweed wraps. We also maintain a dedicated sales desk to facilitate pre-cruise health and wellness services booking and to disseminate health and wellness information for charters and other groups of cruise passengers.
 
10


Recent collaborative initiatives with cruise line partners have proven to enhance performance across certain key performance indicators. We have developed a fully integrated pre-booking platform, which allows guests to book health and wellness treatments six to eight weeks prior to the voyage. Pre-booked and pre-paid guests on average spend approximately 30% more than guests who book services once already onboard. We recently introduced a new pricing strategy, simplifying the choice architecture for our guests while continuing to make price adjustments across multiple areas within our spas. Guests have responded positively, resulting in an increased service spend coupled with a higher frequency of longer treatments booked, and a shift toward booking relatively more premium and signature services. We have begun rolling out our dynamic pricing model to our full cruise fleet, which provides the ability to optimize demand and maximize utilization of our health and wellness centers. We continually monitor the results of our marketing efforts and adjust our strategies in order to use our marketing resources in a cost-effective manner.
 Competition
 
On cruise ships, we compete with passenger activity alternatives for onboard passenger dollars. We also compete with other maritime wellness facility providers, including cruise lines that insource the activity, as well as potential other outsource providers. Across the destination resorts business, we compete with other outsource providers of health, fitness, beauty and wellness services to hotel and destination resort operators. The destination resorts business is highly fragmented, and there is no one leader within this category.
Seasonality
 
A significant portion of our revenues are generated onboard cruise ships and are subject to specific individual cruise itineraries as to time of year and geographic location, among other factors. As a result, we experience varying degrees of seasonality as the demand for cruises is stronger in the Northern Hemisphere during the summer months and during holidays. Accordingly, the third quarter and holiday periods generally result in the highest revenue yields for us. Further, cruises and destination resorts have been negatively affected by the frequency and intensity of hurricanes, which may be impacted by climate change. The negative impact of hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere is highest during peak hurricane season from August to October.
Trademarks
 
We hold or control numerous trademarks in the United States and a number of other countries. Our most recognized health and wellness products and services trademarks are for Mandara and Chavana. We believe that the use of our trademarks is important in establishing and maintaining our reputation for providing high quality health and wellness services, as well as cosmetic goods, and we are committed to protecting these trademarks by all appropriate legal means.
 
Registrations for the OneSpaWorld, Mandara and Chavana trademarks, among others, have been obtained in a number of countries throughout the world. We continue to apply for other trademark registrations in various countries.
 While a number of the trademarks we use have been registered in the United States and other countries, the registrations of other trademarks that we use are pending. Recently, we have adopted the mark “OneSpaWorld” as the trade name of our maritime health and wellness business to reflect our position as a global provider of shipboard products and services.
 We license “Mandara” for use by luxury destination resorts in certain Asian countries.
 Sustainability and Social Responsibility
 With a deep-seated devotion to the environment and the cultures we encounter and embrace, we strive for a better tomorrow by effecting positive change in the lives of stakeholders – our guests, employees, and the inhabitants of the destinations we visit and the locations where we operate and call home. 
 We believe that our impact on the environment, how we manage our relationships with our employees, our cruise and destination resort guests, our suppliers, and the communities where we operate, and the accountability of our leadership to our employees and our stockholders are all critically important to our business. Our company has undertaken a number of strategies to further these objectives, including programs to incorporate sustainability practices, improve data privacy and cybersecurity, increase employee diversity, ensure a respectful workplace, and invest in our communities. Our Board of Directors is responsible for promoting the long-term sustainable growth of the Company, including considering the social and environmental goals of the Company. See “Human Capital” for a more comprehensive description of our social responsibility initiatives.
 With respect to environmental matters, we are collaborating with our third party product suppliers to introduce improved packaging solutions to reduce environmental impact. We have been implementing sustainability strategies by reducing paper usage and plastic water bottles, as well as recycling paper in the workplace, installing light sensors to reduce electricity consumption, and changing packaging materials from polystyrene to recyclable pillow packs. With respect to governance issues, we maintain policies 
 11

with respect to ethical trading, confidential and non-public personal information, anti-fraud, anti-corruption, third party risk management, trade control compliance, data transfers, internal auditing services, global privacy, and global regulatory compliance.
 Human Capital
 As a pre-eminent global operator of health and wellness services, our people are essential to our operations and core to the long-term success of our Company. Our employees are responsible for upholding our purpose, integrity, and accountability, representing OneSpaWorld’s mission and values as a global health and wellness company. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to embed a culture where employees can bring their whole selves to work.
 
Our Board of Directors directly oversees procedures and corporate culture which promotes and upholds the ethical conduct of the Company’s business, including adopting and monitoring compliance with the Company’s Code of Ethics, which, among other things, sets forth the Company’s policy of promoting high standards of integrity by and toward employees in the course of business dealings. The Compensation Committee of our Board is responsible for advising the Board with respect to the compensation philosophy, policies, and equity plans pertaining to our employees, intended to attract, engage, and retain talented personnel. The Audit Committee of our Board is responsible for establishing procedures for the treatment of anonymous employee complaints or concerns received by the Company, through the Company’s Ethics Hotline or otherwise. The Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board is responsible for developing, recommending to the Board, and reviewing on an ongoing basis the adequacy of the Company’s diversity and sustainability policies, as well as reviewing and recommending to the Board changes to the Company’s Code of Ethics. 
 
During the first and second quarters of 2020, in response to the near cessation of our operations due to COVID-19, we took steps to mitigate the adverse impacts of the pandemic, including repatriating 3,220 of our cruise ship personnel to their homes around the world. 
 
 
• | Our People. As a Company that provides health and wellness services and products, our employees are the bedrock of our cruise and resort guest experience. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 2,905 full-time employees. Of that number, 2,717 worked in health and wellness operations and 310 represented management and sales personnel and support staff, while 39 were involved in recruiting and training. We have one health and wellness center manager in each location and can have up to 83 total staff depending on the size of the center. As a global operation, we have a diverse team of employees who represent the locations and markets we serve and in which we operate. Approximately 369 of our employees were located in the United States. We believe our relationship with our employees is strong.

• | Diversity & Inclusion. Our Company achieves success by recruiting, training, supporting and resourcing employees from diverse demographic and socioeconomic populations across the globe, so as to best serve our cruise line and destination resort partners and their diverse global cruise line and destination resort base. We maintain an unwavering commitment to diversity and inclusion among our staff. OneSpaWorld is an equal opportunity employer, and we promote and celebrate diversity and inclusion in the workplace. We advertise U.S. corporate and destination resort spa positions on a human resources applicant tracking system, which provides visibility toward all applicants, including diverse candidates. As of December 31, 2021, our employees had the following attributes:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Female | | Male
-------------------+--------+-------+-----
Employees | | 2,205 | | 437
Manager Staff | 189 | | 71 
Executive Officers | 1 | | 2 

 
In order to successfully achieve our goals toward diversity and inclusion, we strive to educate employees, managers, and leadership on these essential topics. Among other things, we provide annual trainings on the following topics: culture of civility, anti-harassment best practices, cultivating a respectful workplace, anti-harassment crash course: steering clear of sexual harassment, and halting harassment: prevention basics for management. 
  
• | Talent Attraction. Our continued success is dependent on our ability to attract qualified employees. Our goal in recruiting and training new employees is to have available a sufficient number of skilled personnel trained in our customer service philosophy. Our cruise line and destination resort staff are sourced from over 95 countries. We recruit prospective shipboard health and wellness center employees from geographies including Australia, the British Isles, Canada, the Caribbean, continental Europe, India, Indonesia, Mauritius, the Philippines, South Africa, South America, and Thailand, providing an ample pipeline of talent from a wide range of demographics.

• | Talent Retention: Compensation and Benefits. We strive to provide competitive pay and benefits for our employees.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Shipboard spa employees typically are employed under nine month-long agreements with fixed terms. Our compensation arrangements include commissions received in connection with the provision of services and sales of products in our spas. We make available to all our shipboard employees comprehensive health and dental care, free of charge during the terms of their employment agreements, and provide long-term disability and death compensation, among other benefits. We provide our shipboard employees with transportation to their home countries free of charge following the completion of their employment terms. Our shipboard employees and their families and friends are entitled to discounts on the services and products we offer for sale, as well as personalized fitness and wellness programs. In recent years, we have improved staff retention, resulting in a more experienced staff across our fleet. 
 Employees at our destination resorts generally are employed without contracts, on an at-will basis, although most of our employees in Asia have one- or two-year contracts. Our U.S. corporate and destination resort spa employees are eligible to receive the following company benefits, some of which are Company sponsored, and some of which are voluntary: medical, dental, vision, 401(k) retirement plan, short term disability, long term disability, critical illness, flexible spending account, basic life insurance and basic accidental death and dismemberment, medical indemnity, off the job accident insurance, spouse life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment, child life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment. We provide an employee assistance program free of charge to our employees and members of their households, offering face-to-face mental health counseling sessions with a local provider, legal assistance, financial consultations, resources and referrals for childcare assistance and adoption, eldercare, pet care, and consultations with fraud resolution specialists intended to prevent identity theft.
  
• | Health and Safety. The health and safety of our employees remains our highest priority. During 2021, COVID-19 continued to pose a significant risk to our employees. We have undertaken a number of initiatives in connection with our reopening plan and our response to COVID-19, including the continuation of the availability of a remote work environment for our corporate employees. All staff returning to ships are required to complete training modules prior to returning to sea. We created a comprehensive manual entitled “Guidelines for Protection and Sanitization,” or “GPS,” which includes, among others, protocols for sanitization by service, modality and area, behavior, workplace controls, the use of personal protective equipment, social distancing, recognizing signs of COVID-19, and reporting procedures. As of the date of this report, more than 2,500 of our shipboard staff have successfully completed this training. In conjunction with corporate employees returning to our corporate office in Coral Gables, employees will be required to complete a training course regarding compliance with COVID-19 protocols, in alignment with CDC guidelines.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Culture and Ethics. We strive to bring our culture of ethical behavior to the forefront of our organization, and it is our values and mission that binds our business together. We visited over 1,200 global ports of call and operated 69 destination resorts in over 13 countries as of December 31, 2019, prior to the near cessation of our operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have instituted best practices to ensure that we continue to operate to the highest standards, including requiring all our employees to familiarize themselves during the training with, and adhere strictly to, our Code of Ethics and other corporate policies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Training and Development. Our business relies on the ever-changing needs and desires of our customer base. These changes require that our employees are armed with best-in-class training and development in emerging areas of health and wellness. We also operate in areas that are subject to regulation and licensing. To respond to these challenges, we have developed extensive training and licensing practices. Our efforts include training at our London Wellness Academy and our satellite training facilities in South Africa and the Philippines, ranging from two to six weeks depending on the profession and modality of each employee, onboard training for certain of our shipboard employees, and management training courses at our Coral Gables office. All our employees are required to complete sexual harassment training, and our shipboard employees also complete health and safety training upon boarding the vessels on which they serve. Certain shipboard employees also complete additional training on safe practices in providing our services, and training on cleaning and sanitization of our equipment and spa facilities. Our employees also receive training using our comprehensive “GPS” manual prior to returning to work.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We encourage our employees to progress through roles of increasing responsibility within our corporate structure during their tenures by providing numerous opportunities for development and training support. Most senior positions held by our Coral Gables and London Wellness Academy employees are occupied by individuals who began their careers as members of our shipboard spa teams. In our corporate office in Coral Gables, employees receive annual refresher and development training through the Company’s state of the art learning management system, and are required to review a variety of learning modules containing training content relevant to our globally diverse organization. As a substitute for our in-person training programs for existing and prospective staff, we have sought to limit our costs and our carbon footprint by offering eLearning modules for our 
 13

shipboard staff, which we have integrated into our learning management system platform. The eLearning modules have also been an important component of our efforts to safely train our staff in a remote manner during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
  
• | Succession Planning. The success of our business relies on the steady and experienced leadership of key employees. We continually strive to foster the personal and professional development of senior management and other critical roles throughout the organization. As a result, we have developed a strong group of leaders with lengthy tenures. The performance of our senior management team members is subject to ongoing monitoring and evaluation, intended to ensure efficient identification of potential successors and smooth transitions within the team.
