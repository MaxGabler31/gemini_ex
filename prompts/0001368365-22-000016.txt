ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
Remark Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Remark”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), and the variable-interest entities (“VIEs”) that Remark consolidates, constitute a diversified global technology business with leading artificial intelligence (“AI”) and data-analytics, as well as a portfolio of digital media properties. 
Our innovative artificial intelligence (“AI”) and data analytics solutions continue to gain worldwide awareness and recognition through comparative testing, product demonstrations, media exposure, and word of mouth. We continue to see positive responses and increased acceptance of our software and applications in a growing number of industries. We intend to expand our business in three major regions, Asia-Pacific, North America, and Europe. The Asia-Pacific region has a fast-growth AI market with significant opportunities for our solutions. In North America, primarily in the United States, and in Europe, we see robust demand for AI products and solutions in a growing number of industries, including potential growth opportunities particularly in the workplace, schools, transportation and public safety markets, as well as economic and geopolitical conditions, particularly in international markets, could adversely affect our business. We continue to pursue large business opportunities where we can quickly deploy our software solutions in the market segments we have identified, in which we may face a number of large, well-known competitors.
Our corporate headquarters and U.S. operations are based in Las Vegas, Nevada, and we also maintain operations in London, England and Shanghai, China. The operations of the VIEs are headquartered in Chengdu, China with additional operations in Hangzhou. Our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbol MARK.
OUR BUSINESS
Corporate Structure
We are a holding company incorporated in Delaware and not a Chinese operating company. As a holding company, we conduct a significant part of our operations through our subsidiaries and through contractual arrangements with the VIEs based in China. We use the VIE structure to address challenges resulting from laws, policies and practices that may disfavor foreign-owned entities that operate within industries deemed sensitive by the Chinese government. We own 100% of the equity of a wholly foreign owned enterprise (“WFOE”), which has entered into contractual arrangements with the VIEs, which are owned by members of our management team in China and/or by third parties. 
We fund the registered capital and operating expenses of the VIEs on behalf of the shareholders of the VIEs by making advances to the VIEs. We believe that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIEs because the contractual arrangements governing the relationship between the VIEs and our WFOE, which include an exclusive call option agreement, exclusive business cooperation agreement, a proxy agreement and an equity pledge agreement, enable us to (i) exercise effective control over the VIEs, (ii) receive substantially all of the economic benefits of the VIEs, and (iii) have an exclusive call option to purchase, at any time, all or part of the equity interests in and/or assets of the VIEs to the extent permitted by Chinese laws. Because these contractual arrangements with the VIEs provide us with the power to direct the activities of the VIEs, for accounting purposes we are the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and we have consolidated the financial results of the VIEs in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
The agreements governing the VIE contractual arrangements have not been tested in a court of law. However, an article published in China Business Law Journal indicated that a China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (“CIETAC”) Shanghai tribunal ruled in 2010 and 2011 in two related cases involving the contractual arrangement of an online game operating company that the contractual arrangement was void on the grounds that such arrangement violated the mandatory administrative regulations prohibiting foreign investors from investing in the online game operation business and constituted “concealing illegal intentions with a lawful form.” According to publicly available information, while the agreements entered into by the parties in the aforementioned CIETAC cases are typical VIE agreements, the PRC domestic company involved in such cases was mainly engaged in online game operation. Although the PRC foreign investment regime restricts or prohibits foreign investment in certain industries, online game operation is one of few industries where there are rules specifically prohibiting foreign investors from controlling and participating in the business indirectly through contractual 
or technical support arrangements. Though the agreements in the CIETAC cases are similar to our contractual arrangements with the VIEs, we and the VIEs do not operate in the online game operation industry and, to our knowledge, the business conducted by the VIEs is not prohibited from investment from foreign investors in China. We also note that the rulings in the CIETAC cases are not binding on Chinese courts or other arbitration tribunals.
The following diagram illustrates our corporate structure, including our significant subsidiaries, and the relationship between our WFOE and the VIEs as of the date of this Form 10-K. The diagram omits certain entities which are immaterial to our results of operations and financial condition. Equity interests depicted in this diagram are 100% owned. The relationships between each of Chengdu Remark Technology Co., Ltd., Hangzhou Shufeng Technology Co., Ltd., Remark Data Technology Co., Ltd. and Bonet (Beijing) Technology LLC, which constitute the VIEs, on the one hand, and KanKan Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., our WFOE, on the other hand, as illustrated in the following diagram are governed by contractual arrangements and do not constitute equity ownership.
Because we do not directly hold equity interests in the VIEs, we are subject to risks and uncertainties of the interpretations and applications of Chinese laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the validity and enforcement of the contractual arrangements among the WFOE, the VIEs and the shareholders of the VIEs. We are also subject to the risks and uncertainties about any future actions of the Chinese government in this regard that could disallow the VIE structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations and may cause the value of our common stock to depreciate significantly or become worthless.
The contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control and we face contractual exposure in such arrangements. For instance, the VIEs and their shareholders could breach their contractual arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct their operations in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. The shareholders of the VIEs may not act in the best interests of our Company or may not perform their obligations under these contracts. Such risks exist throughout the period in which we intend to operate certain portions of our business through the contractual arrangements with the VIEs. In the event that the VIEs or their shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements. In addition, even if legal actions are taken to enforce such arrangements, there is uncertainty as to whether Chinese courts would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state.
We are subject to certain legal and operational risks associated with having a significant portion of our operations in China. Chinese laws and regulations governing our current business operations, including the enforcement of such laws and regulations, are sometimes vague and uncertain and can change quickly with little advance notice. The Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations and the operations of the VIEs at any time and may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our securities. In addition, any actions by the Chinese government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers could significant limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. Recently, the Chinese government adopted a series of regulatory actions and issued statements to regulate business operations in China, including those related to the use of variable interest entities, data security and anti-monopoly concerns. As of the date of this Form 10-K, neither we nor the VIEs have been involved in any investigations on cybersecurity review initiated by any Chinese regulatory authority, nor has any of them received any inquiry, notice or sanction. As of the date of this Form 10-K, no relevant laws or regulations in China explicitly require us to seek approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the “CSRC”) for any securities listing. As of the date of this Form 10-K, neither we nor the VIEs have received any inquiry, notice, warning or sanctions regarding our planned overseas listing from the CSRC or any other Chinese governmental authorities relating to securities listings. However, since these statements and regulatory actions are newly published, official guidance and related implementation rules have not been issued. It is highly uncertain what potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our ability to conduct our business, accept investments or list or maintain a listing on a U.S. or foreign exchange.
As of the date of this Form 10-K, we and the VIEs are not required to seek permissions from the CSRC, the Cyberspace Administration of China (the “CAC”), or any other entity that is required to approve of the operations of the VIEs. Nevertheless, Chinese regulatory authorities may in the future promulgate laws, regulations or implement rules that require us, our subsidiaries or the VIEs to obtain permissions from such regulatory authorities to approve the operations of the VIEs or any securities listing.
Business Model
We currently earn the majority of our revenue from sales of AI-based products and services. Excluding general and administrative expense, the primary costs we incur to earn the revenue described above include:
•software development costs, including licensing costs for third-party software
•cost of equipment related to customized AI products
•costs associated with marketing our brands

AI Business
Through the proprietary data and AI software platform we co-developed with one of the VIEs, our Remark AI business in the U.S. and the KanKan AI business operated by the VIEs in the Asia-Pacific region generate revenue by delivering AI-based computer vision products, computing devices and software-as-a-service solutions for businesses in many industries. In addition to the other work that we and the VIEs have ramped up, we and the VIEs continue partnering with top universities on research projects targeting algorithm, artificial neural network and computing architectures which we believe keeps us among the leaders 
in technology development. Our research team continues to participate in various computer vision competitions at which it wins or ranks near or at the top.
We continue to market Remark AI’s innovative AI-based solutions to customers in the retail, urban life cycle and workplace and food safety markets. We have also begun to expand our AI-based safety solutions to railway customers in the transportation market.
Retail Solutions. Utilizing a client’s existing cameras and IoT devices placed throughout the store, Remark AI’s retail solutions swiftly analyze real-time customer shopping behavior, such as time of store entry and shelf-browsing habits, and provide managers with a customer heatmap that reflects traffic patterns. Purchase history is also analyzed, leading to relevant offers for future purchase conversions, and customers for their continued loyalty through a special VIP status that brings customized promotions and coupons along with attentive customer service. Remark AI’s retail solutions allow retailers and store managers to make better data-driven decisions regarding store layout, item placement, and pricing strategy, all while anonymizing customers’ identities to protect their privacy. 
Urban Life Cycle Solutions. We offer and have installed several solutions in what we call the urban life cycle category. Our urban life cycle solutions include our AI community system which assists in building “smart” communities by enhancing community security and safety. We also have AI solutions that help to make schools “smart” by (i) providing an accurate and convenient method for student check-in and check-out, (ii) providing an autonomous method of campus monitoring that enhances students’ safety by, for example, monitoring students for elevated body temperatures that could indicate viral infections such as influenza or COVID-19, detecting trespassers, detecting dangerous behaviors or physical accidents that could result in injury, and (iii) monitoring the school kitchen for safety violations.
In traffic management, our solutions assist in monitoring traffic for various violations by automatically detecting, capturing, and obtaining evidence regarding violations such as speeding, running red lights, driving against the flow of traffic and even using counterfeit registration plates. Additionally, our solutions provide constant road-condition monitoring, providing control centers with real-time information on traffic conditions such as areas of congestion or other traffic anomalies.
Workplace and Food Safety Solutions. The monitoring and detection capabilities of our solutions ensure that workers are practicing established food safety protocols, wearing the proper personal protective equipment, and complying with local health codes. From commercial kitchens to factories to construction work zones, our safety-compliance algorithms manage regulatory functions, review hygienic and equipment status while checking and alerting management regarding violations.
Railway Safety Solutions. In railway settings, our product known as the Smart Sentry uses the SSP (safety and security platform) software, a specialized version of the software platform we developed with one of the VIEs, to provide intrusion-detection capabilities that allow customers to monitor railroad tracks, rail yards and other sensitive areas around the clock, in all weather conditions and at varying distances. The Smart Sentry, which customers can deploy as an individual unit or as a system of units, detects when pedestrians or vehicles are crossing a railway or entering the railway tracks as a train is approaching, and then alerts customer personnel to the situation so action can be taken to prevent hazardous incidents from happening. When deployed in multiple-unit systems, each Smart Sentry unit works in concert with the other units to relay warnings that give train operators sufficient time to respond to the track intrusions from miles away. Using the Smart Sentry’s high-end cameras and other hardware, the SSP also gathers and analyzes data on railway traffic and weather conditions along various railways to provide valuable, actionable information to railway personnel. In the near future, we expect to add more safety features to Smart Sentry, such as the ability to detect worn or otherwise damaged track and the ability to identify stationary obstacles like fallen rocks or trees.
Biosafety Solutions. With help from one of the VIEs, we repurposed and improved our existing urban life cycle solution that we were selling to make schools in China “smart” schools to build a product line of high-quality, highly-effective thermal imaging solutions that leverage our innovative software. 
We sell our Remark AI Thermal Kits to customers needing the ability to scan crowds and areas of high foot traffic for indications that certain persons with elevated temperatures may require secondary screening. Though the kits are semi-customizable, they generally consist primarily of a thermal imaging camera, a calibrating device, a computer to monitor the video feed, supporting equipment and our AI software. Once set up and calibrated, the kits scan a large number of people each minute, providing both thermally enhanced and standard video feeds that allow our customers to evaluate high volumes of people at large gatherings.
Our Remark AI rPad thermal imaging devices, usually mounted on a wall or a single-post stand, are designed for customers needing the ability to scan individuals on a one-by-one basis in situations where rapid, high-volume scanning is not necessary, such as at a customer’s office entrances where employees can be scanned as they enter for indications of an elevated temperature that may require secondary screening. In addition to thermal scanning, we can customize our AI software embedded in the rPad to perform additional safety and security functions including identifying persons for authorized entry.
Other Businesses
In 2009, we co-founded a U.S.-based venture, Sharecare, Inc. (“Legacy Sharecare”), to build a web-based platform that simplifies the search for health and wellness information. The other co-founders of Legacy Sharecare were Dr. Mehmet Oz, HARPO Productions, Discovery Communications, Jeff Arnold and Sony Pictures Television. 
On July 1, 2021, Legacy Sharecare completed a business combination with Falcon Capital Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company, as a result of which the common stock of the surviving entity of such business combination (“New Sharecare”) became listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. In connection with the completion of such business combination, the shares of common stock of Legacy Sharecare that we held immediately prior to the business combination converted into cash and approximately 9.4 million shares of common stock of New Sharecare. We do not maintain a seat on the board of directors of New Sharecare.
We continue to evaluate opportunities to monetize and maximize the value of this asset for our shareholders. In addition to Data Platform Services revenue from our AI business, activities such as online merchandise sales generated from Bikini.com, our e-commerce website selling swimwear and accessories in the latest styles, also contributed to our consolidated revenue in the current-year and prior-year periods, while advertising also contributed to revenue.
Competition
We compete for business primarily on the basis of the quality and reliability of our products and services, and primarily in the AI marketplace, which is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving.
Our AI-based products and services represent a significant opportunity for us in the future. We offer AI products and we also build and deploy custom AI solutions. Our AI products compete with companies such as SenseTime, Face++, Google, GoGoVan, WeLab and others, while we compete with companies such as PricewaterhouseCoopers, Hewlett Packard, Baidu and others for business in the AI solutions market space.
Some of the companies we compete against, or may compete against in the future, may have greater brand recognition and may have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. As a result of the potentially greater brand recognition and resources, some of our competitors may bring new products and services to market more quickly, and they may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we could adopt.
Intellectual Property

We rely upon trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in various jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary assets and brands. The VIEs we consolidate own 33 copyright registrations and nine AI-related patents, they have 27 AI-related patents pending in China and they are preparing several additional patent applications to file in China.
Technology
Our technologies include software applications built to run on third-party cloud hosting providers including Amazon Web Services and Alibaba located in North America and Asia. We make substantial use of off-the-shelf available open-source technologies such as Linux, PHP, MySQL, Drupal, mongoDB, Memcache, Apache, Nginx, CouchBase, Hadoop, HBase, ElasticSearch, Lua, Java, Redis, Akka and Wordpress, in addition to commercial platforms such as Microsoft, including Windows Operating Systems, SQL Server, and .NET. Such systems are connected to the Internet via load balancers, firewalls, and routers installed in multiple redundant pairs. We also utilize third-party services to geographically deliver data using major 
content distribution network providers. We rely heavily on virtualization throughout our technology architecture, which enables the scaling of dozens of digital media properties in an efficient and cost-effective manner.
We use third-party cloud hosting providers to host most of our public-facing websites and applications, as well as many of our back-end business intelligence and financial systems. Each of our significant websites is designed to be fault-tolerant, with collections of application servers, typically configured in a load-balanced state, to provide additional resiliency. The infrastructure is equipped with enterprise-class security solutions to combat events such as large-scale distributed denial of service attacks. Our environment is staffed and equipped with a full-scale monitoring solution.
Governmental Regulation
The services we provide are subject to various laws and regulations. We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content regulation, intellectual property, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation or other subjects. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. There are a number of legislative proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies concerning data protection that may affect us. We incorporated the principles of the European Union (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) into our internal data protection policy for our product development and solution implementation. In addition, we voluntarily hired an independent, authorized third party in Germany to conduct a GDPR audit of our privacy practices. The audit found that we are compliant with the GDPR principles.
We post our privacy policy and practices concerning the use and disclosure of any user data on our web properties and our distribution applications. Any failure by us to comply with posted privacy policies, federal and state regulatory requirements or foreign privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings by governmental or regulatory bodies that could potentially harm our businesses, results of operations and financial condition.
Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. The Chinese government has at times taken measures to restrict digital platforms, publishers or specific content themes from consumption by its citizens. We invest significant efforts into ensuring that our published content in China is consistent with our most current understanding of prevailing Chinese laws, regulations, and policies; and to date our published content in China has been met with successful distribution and no action or inquiry from the Chinese government. However, unforeseen regulatory restrictions or policy changes in China regarding digital content could have a material adverse effect on our business.
The Chinese government has not yet adopted a clear regulatory framework governing the new and rapidly-evolving artificial intelligence industry in which we operate. The Chinese government’s adoption of more stringent laws or enforcement protocols affecting participants in such industries (including, without limitation, restrictions on foreign investment, capital requirements and licensing requirements) could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Transfer of Cash or Assets
Dividend Distributions
As of the date of this Form 10-K, none of our subsidiaries or any of the consolidated VIEs have made any dividends or distributions to our Company.
We have never declared or paid dividends or distributions on our common equity. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future consolidated earnings to fund our operations and continue the development and growth of our business; therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends.
Under Delaware law, a Delaware corporation’s ability to pay cash dividends on its capital stock requires the corporation to have either net profits or positive net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over its capital. If we determine to pay dividends on any of our common stock in the future, as a holding company, we may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity 
from our WFOE for cash requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash contributions to our stockholders.
Our WFOE’s ability to distribute dividends is based upon its distributable earnings. Current Chinese regulations permit our WFOE to pay dividends to their shareholders only out of its registered capital amount, if any, as determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations, and then only after meeting the statutory reserve equal to 50% of registered capital. If our WFOE incurs debt in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us. Any limitation on the ability of our WFOE to distribute dividends or other payments to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our businesses, pay dividends or otherwise fund and conduct our business. In addition, any cash dividends or distributions of assets by our WFOE to its stockholder are subject to a Chinese withholding tax of as much as 10%.
The Chinese government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of China. Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from our profits, if any. If we are unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations through the current VIE contractual arrangements, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.
For us to pay dividends to our stockholders, we will rely on payments made from the VIEs to our WFOE in accordance with the VIE contractual arrangements, and the distribution of payments from the WFOE to the Delaware holding company as dividends. Certain payments from the VIEs to the WFOE pursuant to the VIE contractual arrangements are subject to Chinese taxes, including a 6% VAT and 25% enterprise income tax.
Our Company’s Ability to Settle Amounts Owed under the VIE Contractual Arrangements
Under the VIE contractual arrangements, the VIEs are obligated to make payments to our WFOE, in cash or in kind, at the WFOE’s request. We will be able to settle amounts owed under the VIE contractual arrangements through dividends paid by our WFOE to our Company. Such ability may be restricted or limited as follows:
First, any payments from the VIEs to our WFOE are subject to Chinese taxes, including a 6% VAT and 25% enterprise income tax.
Second, current Chinese regulations permit our WFOE to pay dividends to their shareholders only out of its registered capital amount, if any, as determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations, and then only after meeting the statutory reserve equal to 50% of registered capital. In addition, if our WFOE incurs debt in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other payments to the Delaware holding company.
Third, the Chinese government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of China. Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from profits, if any
Employees
We employed 74 people as of March 28, 2022, all of which are full-time employees.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
