Item 1 | Business

Unless the context requires otherwise, references to the “Company,” “Penn Virginia,” “we,” “us” or “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to Penn Virginia Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Description of Business 
We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the onshore exploration, development and production of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. Our current operations consist primarily of drilling unconventional horizontal development wells and operating our producing wells in the Eagle Ford Shale, or the Eagle Ford, in Gonzales, Lavaca, Fayette and DeWitt Counties in South Texas. 
We were incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1882. Our common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol “PVAC.” Our headquarters and corporate office is located in Houston, Texas. We also have a field operations office near our Eagle Ford assets in South Texas.
We operate in and report our financial results and disclosures as one segment, which is the exploration, development and production of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas.
Current Operations 
We lease a highly contiguous position of approximately 84,200 net acres (as of December 31, 2018) in the core liquids-rich area or “volatile oil window” of the Eagle Ford in Gonzales, Lavaca, Fayette and Dewitt Counties in Texas, which we believe contains a substantial number of drilling locations that will support a multi-year drilling inventory. 
In 2018, our total production was comprised of 76 percent crude oil, 13 percent NGLs and 11 percent natural gas. Crude oil accounted for 92 percent of our product revenues. We generally sell our crude oil, NGL and natural gas products using short-term floating price physical and spot market contracts. 
As of December 31, 2018, our total proved reserves were approximately 123 MMBOE, of which 38 percent were proved developed reserves and 73 percent were crude oil. As of December 31, 2018, we had 460 gross (377.5 net) productive wells, approximately 97 percent of which we operate, and owned approximately 98,200 gross (84,200 net) acres of leasehold and royalty interests, approximately 9 percent of which were undeveloped. Approximately 92 percent of our acreage is HBP and includes a substantial number of undrilled locations. During 2018, we drilled and completed 53 gross (45.5 net) wells, all in the Eagle Ford. For a more detailed discussion of our production, reserves, drilling activities, wells and acreage, see Part I, Item 2, “Properties.”
On October 28, 2018, Denbury Resources Inc., or Denbury, and Penn Virginia announced that they entered into a definitive merger agreement, or the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Denbury will acquire Penn Virginia, or the Merger. The consideration to be paid to Penn Virginia shareholders will consist of 12.4 shares of Denbury common stock and $25.86 of cash for each share of Penn Virginia common stock. Penn Virginia shareholders will be permitted to elect to receive either all cash, all stock or a mix of stock and cash, in each case subject to proration, which will result in the aggregate issuance by Denbury of approximately 191.667 million Denbury shares and payment by Denbury of $400 million in cash. The transaction was unanimously approved by the board of directors of each company, and certain Penn Virginia shareholders holding approximately 15 percent of the outstanding shares signed voting agreements to vote “for” the transaction. The transaction is subject to the approval by the holders of more than two-thirds of the outstanding Company common shares, the approval by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Denbury common shares of an amendment to the certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized Denbury common shares, the approval of the issuance of Denbury common shares in the Merger by the holders of a majority of the Denbury common shares represented in person or by proxy at a meeting of Denbury shareholders held to vote on such matter and other customary closing conditions. The special meeting of shareholders to approve the merger is anticipated in April 2019 and closing is anticipated soon thereafter, subject to shareholder approval and certain other conditions. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Denbury and the Company, including if the Merger is not consummated by April 30, 2019, and requires Penn Virginia to pay a $45 million termination fee in certain circumstances. 
On July 31, 2018, we sold all of our remaining Mid-Continent oil and gas properties, located primarily in Oklahoma in the Granite Wash. We realized net proceeds of $5.7 million in connection with the sale and utilized those funds in our Eagle Ford development program. Subsequent to the sale, our operations are exclusively focused in the Eagle Ford in South Texas.
On March 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of certain oil and gas assets from Hunt Oil Company, or Hunt, including oil and gas leases covering approximately 9,700 net acres located primarily in Gonzalez and Lavaca Counties, Texas. For a more detailed discussion of this acquisition, see “Key Developments” included in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Emergence from Bankruptcy Proceedings and Fresh Start Accounting
On May 12, 2016, or the Petition Date, we and eight of our subsidiaries, or the Chapter 11 Subsidiaries, filed voluntary petitions (In re Penn Virginia Corporation, et al., Case No. 16-32395) seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or the Bankruptcy Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, or the Bankruptcy Court.
On August 11, 2016, or the Confirmation Date, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed our Second Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Penn Virginia Corporation and its Debtor Affiliates, or the Plan, and we subsequently emerged from bankruptcy on September 12, 2016, or the Emergence Date. On November 20, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court issued a final decree to close the case.
On the Emergence Date, we adopted and applied the relevant guidance with respect to the accounting and financial reporting for entities that have emerged from bankruptcy proceedings, or Fresh Start Accounting. The adoption of Fresh Start Accounting resulted in a new reporting entity, the Successor, for financial reporting purposes. To facilitate our discussion and analysis of our properties, financial condition and results of operations herein, we refer to the reorganized company as the “Successor” for periods subsequent to September 12, 2016, and the “Predecessor” for periods prior to September 13, 2016. For a more detailed discussion of our bankruptcy proceedings, our emergence from bankruptcy and Fresh Start Accounting, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Key Contractual Arrangements
In the ordinary course of operating our business, we enter into a number of key contracts for services that are critical with respect to our ability to develop, produce and bring our production to market. The following is a summary of our most significant contractual arrangements.
Oil gathering and transportation service contracts. We have long-term agreements that provide us with gathering and intermediate pipeline transportation services for a substantial portion of our crude oil and condensate production through 2041 as well as volume capacity support for certain downstream interstate pipeline transportation. 
Natural gas service contracts. We have an agreement that provides us with gas lift, gathering, compression and short-haul transportation services for a substantial portion of our natural gas production until 2039. 
Natural gas processing contracts. We have two agreements that provide us with services to process our wet gas production into NGL products and dry, or residue, gas. These agreements are evergreen in term with either party having the right to terminate with 30-days’ notice to the counterparty. 
Drilling and Completion. From time to time we enter into drilling, completion and materials contracts in the ordinary course of business to ensure availability of rigs, frac crews and materials to satisfy our development program. As of December 31, 2018, there were no drilling, completion or materials agreements with terms that extended beyond one year.
Major Customers 
We sell a significant portion of our oil and gas production to a relatively small number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 69 percent of our consolidated product revenues were attributable to three customers: Phillips 66 Company; BP Products North America Inc. and Shell Trading (US) Company. 
Seasonality
Our sales volumes of oil and gas are dependent upon the number of producing wells and, therefore, are not seasonal by nature. We do not believe that the pricing of our crude oil and NGL production is subject to any meaningful seasonal effects. Historically, the pricing of natural gas is seasonal, typically with higher pricing in the winter months.
Competition
The oil and gas industry is very competitive, and we compete with a substantial number of other companies, many of which are large, well-established and have greater financial and operational resources than we do. Some of our competitors not only engage in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves, but also carry on refining operations, electricity generation and the marketing of refined products. In addition, the oil and gas industry in general competes with other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Competition is particularly intense in the acquisition of prospective oil and gas properties. We may incur higher costs or be unable to acquire and develop desirable properties at costs we consider reasonable because of this competition. We also compete with other oil and gas companies to secure drilling rigs, frac fleets, sand and other equipment and materials necessary for the drilling and completion of wells and in the recruiting and retaining of qualified personnel. Such materials, equipment and labor may be in short supply from time to time. Shortages of equipment, labor or materials may result in increased costs or the inability to obtain such resources as needed. Many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to commodity price volatility and overall industry cycles.

Government Regulation and Environmental Matters 
Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern oil and gas operations, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment. These laws, rules and regulations may, among other things:

• | require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences;


• | require notice to stakeholders of proposed and ongoing operations;


• | require the installation of expensive pollution control equipment;


• | restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and gas drilling and production and saltwater disposal activities;


• | limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, or otherwise restrict or prohibit activities that could impact the environment, including water resources; and


• | require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells.

Numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws that are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial administrative, civil and even criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities for failure to comply. Violations and liabilities with respect to these laws and regulations could also result in remedial clean-ups, natural resource damages, permit modifications or revocations, operational interruptions or shutdowns and other liabilities. The costs of remedying such conditions may be significant, and remediation obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In certain instances, citizens or citizen groups also have the ability to bring legal proceedings against us if we are not in compliance with environmental laws or to challenge our ability to receive environmental permits that we need to operate. Some laws, rules and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose “strict liability” for environmental contamination, rendering a person liable for environmental and natural resource damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. Other laws, rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist or even prohibit exploration or production activities in sensitive areas. In addition, state laws often require some form of remedial action to prevent pollution from former operations, such as plugging of abandoned wells. As of December 31, 2018, we have recorded asset retirement obligations of $4.3 million attributable to these activities. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability. These laws, rules and regulations affect our operations, as well as the oil and gas exploration and production industry in general.
In addition, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, has designated energy extraction as one of six national enforcement initiatives, and has indicated that the agency will direct resources towards addressing incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws, rules and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws or regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations, including any significant limitation on the use of hydraulic fracturing, could have the potential to adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Federal, state or local administrative decisions, developments in the federal or state court systems or other governmental or judicial actions may influence the interpretation or enforcement of environmental laws and regulations and may thereby increase compliance costs. Environmental regulations have historically become more stringent over time, and thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation.
The following is a summary of the significant environmental laws to which our business operations are subject.
CERCLA. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, is also known as the “Superfund” law. CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on parties that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Such “responsible parties” may be subject to joint and several liability under CERCLA for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We currently own or lease properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas for a number of years. Many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties, and any wastes that may have been released on them, may be subject to CERCLA, and we could potentially be required to investigate and remediate such properties, including soil or groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators, or to perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination. States also have environmental cleanup laws analogous to CERCLA, including Texas.
6

RCRA. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA. While there is currently an exclusion from RCRA for drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration and production of oil or gas, it is possible that some of these wastes could be classified as hazardous waste in the future and therefore be subject to more stringent regulation under RCRA. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and certain environmental organizations entered into a consent decree to address the EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production-related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. Any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Also, in the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as hazardous wastes if such wastes have hazardous characteristics.
Oil Pollution Act. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or the OPA, contains numerous restrictions relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. The term “waters of the United States” has been interpreted broadly to include inland water bodies, including wetlands and intermittent streams. The OPA imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines. For example, operators of certain oil and gas facilities must develop, implement and maintain facility response plans, conduct annual spill training for certain employees and provide varying degrees of financial assurance. Owners or operators of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge is one type of “responsible party” who is liable. The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict, joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs, and certain other damages arising from a spill. As such, a violation of the OPA has the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Clean Water Act. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act, and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into regulated waters, such as waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants, including dredge or fill materials in regulated wetlands, into regulated waters or wetlands without a permit issued by the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or the Corps, or the state is prohibited. The Clean Water Act has been interpreted by these agencies to apply broadly. The EPA and the Corps released a rule to revise the definition of “waters of the United States,” or WOTUS, for all Clean Water Act programs, which went into effect in August 2015. In January 2017, the United States Supreme Court accepted review of the rule to determine whether jurisdiction to hear challenges to the rule rests with the federal district or appellate courts. In January 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that district courts have jurisdiction over challenges to the rule. EPA has instituted rulemakings to both delay the effective date of this rule and repeal the rule. Federal district court decisions have preserved the stay of the 2015 Clean Water Rule in Texas, which remains subject to pre-2015 regulated waters regulations, whereas the stay has been enjoined in a minority of states. Litigation surrounding this rule is ongoing. More recently, on December 11, 2018, the EPA and the Corps released a proposal to revise the 2015 Clean Water Rule so as to narrow the regulatory definition of waters of the United States, with a 60-day comment period to follow.
The Clean Water Act also requires the preparation and implementation of Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plans in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. In 2016, the EPA finalized new wastewater pretreatment standards that would prohibit onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities from sending wastewater to publicly-owned treatment works. This restriction of disposal options for hydraulic fracturing waste may result in increased costs. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
Safe Drinking Water Act. The Safe Drinking Water Act, or the SDWA, and the Underground Injection Control Program promulgated under the SDWA, establish the requirements for salt water disposal well activities and prohibit the migration of fluid-containing contaminants into underground sources of drinking water. The Underground Injection Well Program requires that we obtain permits from the EPA or delegated state agencies for our disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for injection well operations, restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be injected and prohibits the migration of fluid containing any contaminants into underground sources of drinking water. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells may cause degradation of freshwater, potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well, imposition of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of affected resources, and imposition of liability by landowners or other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and personal injuries. In addition, in some instances, the operation of underground injection wells has been alleged to cause earthquakes (induced seismicity) as a result of flawed well design or operation. This has resulted in stricter regulatory requirements in some jurisdictions relating to the location and operation of underground injection wells, and regulators in some 
7

states are seeking to impose additional requirements, including requirements regarding the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise, to assess the relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, in October 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission, or TRC, adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, among other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water or other oil and gas waste to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the produced water or other fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, contributing to seismic activity, then TRC may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that disposal well. TRC has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells. The potential adoption of federal, state and local legislation and regulations intended to address induced seismic activity in the areas in which we operate could restrict our drilling and production activities, as well as our ability to dispose of produced water gathered from such activities, which could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays. 
We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with the wells in which we act as operator. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and gas wells, particularly in unconventional plays like the Eagle Ford formation, and is generally exempted from federal regulation as underground injection (unless diesel is a component of the fracturing fluid) under the SDWA. In addition, separate and apart from the referenced potential connection between injection wells and seismicity, concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing activities may be correlated to induced seismicity. The EPA also released the results of its comprehensive research study to investigate the potential adverse impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and ground water in December 2016, finding that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells. These developments could establish an additional level of regulation, including a removal of the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the SDWA, and permitting of hydraulic fracturing operations at the federal level, which could lead to operational delays, increased operating and compliance costs and additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult or commercially impracticable for us to perform hydraulic fracturing. Such costs and burdens could delay the development of unconventional gas resources from shale formations, which are not commercially feasible without the use of hydraulic fracturing.
Chemical Disclosures Related to Hydraulic Fracturing. Certain states in which we operate have adopted regulations requiring the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. For instance, Texas has implemented chemical disclosure requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. We currently disclose all hydraulic fracturing additives we use on www.FracFocus.org, a website created by the Ground Water Protection Council and Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission.
Prohibitions and Other Regulatory Limitations on Hydraulic Fracturing. There have been a variety of regulatory initiatives at the state level to restrict oil and gas drilling operations in certain locations. 
In addition to chemical disclosure rules, some states have implemented permitting, well construction or water withdrawal regulations that may increase the costs of hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, Texas has water withdrawal restrictions allowing suspension of withdrawal rights in times of shortages while other states require reporting on the amount of water used and its source. 
Increased regulation of and attention given by environmental interest groups, as well as state and federal regulatory authorities, to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. These developments could also lead to litigation challenging proposed or existing wells. The adoption of federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing that are more stringent could cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells, as well as increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We use hydraulic fracturing extensively and any increased federal, state, or local regulation of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the volumes of oil and gas that we can economically recover.

Clean Air Act. Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, or the CAA, and comparable state and local requirements. In 1990, the U.S. Congress adopted amendments to the CAA containing provisions that have resulted in the gradual imposition of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations. The EPA and states have developed, and continue to develop, regulations to implement these requirements. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals addressing other air emission-related issues. Further, stricter requirements could negatively impact our production and operations. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. 
On April 17, 2012, the EPA issued final rules to subject oil and gas operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards, or NSPS, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or NESHAPS, programs under the CAA, and to impose new and amended requirements under both programs. The EPA rules include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells, compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. Further, in May 2016, the EPA issued final NSPS governing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry as well as source determination standards for determining when oil and gas sources should be aggregated for CAA permitting and compliance purposes. The NSPS for methane extends the 2012 NSPS to completions of hydraulically fractured oil wells, equipment leaks, pneumatic pumps and natural gas compressors. In June 2017, the EPA proposed a two year stay of the fugitive emissions monitoring requirements, pneumatic pump standards and closed vent system certification requirements in the 2016 NSPS rule for the oil and gas industry while it reconsiders these aspects of the rule. The proposal is still under consideration. More recently, in September 2018, the EPA proposed targeted improvements to the rule, including amendments to the rule’s fugitive emissions monitoring requirements, and expects to “significantly reduce” the regulatory burden of the rule in doing so. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, finalized similar rules in November 2016 that limit methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas operations on federal lands through limitations on the venting and flaring of gas, as well as enhanced leak detection and repair requirements. The BLM adopted final rules in January 2017; operators generally had one year from the January 2017 effective date of the rule to come into compliance with the rule’s requirements. However, in December 2017, the BLM temporarily suspended or delayed certain of these requirements set forth in its Venting and Flaring Rule until January 2019, and in September 2018, the BLM proposed a revised rule which would scale back the waste-prevention requirements of the 2016 rule. Environmental groups sued in federal district court a day later to challenge the legality of aspects of the revised rule, and the outcome of this litigation is currently uncertain. These rules have required changes to our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions. The EPA had announced in 2016 an intent to impose methane emission standards for existing sources, but the agency was sued by multiple states for failing to implement these standards following the agency’s withdrawal of information collection requests for oil and gas facilities. These rules would result in an increase to our operating costs and change to our operations. As a result of this continued regulatory focus, future federal and state regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility and could result in increased compliance costs on our operations.
In November 2015, the EPA revised the existing National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ground level ozone to make the standard more stringent. The EPA finished promulgating final area designations under the new standard in 2018, which, to the extent areas in which we operate have been classified as non-attainment, may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. Generally, it will take the states several years to develop compliance plans for their non-attainment areas. While we are not able to determine the extent to which this new standard will impact our business at this time, it has the potential to have a material impact on our operations and cost structure.    
In June 2016, the EPA finalized a rule “aggregating” individual wells and other facilities and their collective emissions for purposes of determining whether major source permitting requirements apply under the CAA. These changes may introduce uncertainty into the permitting process and could require more lengthy and costly permitting processes and more expensive emission controls.
Collectively, these rules and proposed rules, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require a number of modifications to our operations. We may, for example, be required to install new equipment to control emissions from our well sites or compressors at initial startup or by the applicable compliance deadline. We may also be required to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities. Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions. In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other “greenhouse gases,” or GHGs, present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has issued regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. These regulations include limits on tailpipe emissions from motor vehicles and preconstruction and operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources.

Both in the United States and worldwide, there is increasing attention being paid to the issue of climate change and the contributing effect of GHG emissions. Most recently in April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. However, in June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or establish a new framework agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.
In August 2015, the EPA issued new regulations limiting carbon dioxide emissions from existing power generation facilities. Under this rule, nationwide carbon dioxide emissions would be reduced by approximately 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 with a flexible interim goal. Several industry groups and states challenged the rule. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the implementation of this rule pending judicial review. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing the EPA to review the regulations, and on April 4, 2017, the EPA announced that it was reviewing the 2015 carbon dioxide regulations. On April 28, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed the litigation pending the current administration’s review. That stay was extended for another 60 days on August 8, 2017. On October 10, 2017, the EPA initiated the formal rulemaking process to repeal the regulations, which has not been finalized. In August 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy rule (ACE) as a replacement to the 2015 regulations. ACE primarily addresses onsite efficiency improvements for power plants and does not require generation-shifting to low- or zero-emitting energy sources. The EPA’s proposals will be subject to public comment or legal challenge, and as such we cannot predict at this time what impact the rulemakings will have on the demand for oil and gas production and our operations.
The EPA has issued the “Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases” Rule and a series of revisions to it, which requires operators of oil and gas production, natural gas processing, transmission, distribution and storage facilities and other stationary sources emitting more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxide-equivalent GHGs to inventory and report their GHG emissions occurring in the prior calendar year on a facility-by-facility basis. These rules do not require control of GHGs. However, the EPA has indicated that it will use data collected through the reporting rules to decide whether to promulgate future GHG limits. 
In certain circumstances, large sources of GHG emissions are subject to preconstruction permitting under the EPA’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration program. This program historically has had minimal applicability to the oil and gas production industry. However, there can be no assurance that our operations will avoid applicability of these or similar permitting requirements, which impose costs relating to emissions control systems and the efforts needed to obtain the permit.
Additional GHG regulations potentially affecting our industry include those described above under the subheading “Clean Air Act” which relate to methane.
Future federal GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility. Also, many states and regions have adopted GHG initiatives and certain governmental bodies have or are considering the imposition of fees or taxes based on the emission of GHGs by certain facilities. Many states have established GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and natural gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. While it is not possible to predict how any regulations to restrict GHG emissions may come into force, these and other legislative and regulatory proposals for restricting GHG emissions or otherwise addressing climate change could require us to incur additional operating costs or curtail oil and gas operations in certain areas and could also adversely affect demand for the oil and gas we sell.
Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations.
OSHA. We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations, and the provision of such information to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. Other OSHA standards regulate specific worker safety aspects of our operations.
Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act restricts activities that may affect endangered species or their habitats. While some of our facilities are in areas that may be designated as a habitat for endangered species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the Endangered Species Act. The presence of any protected species or the final designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate could result in increased costs from species protection measures or could result in limitations, delays, or prohibitions on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.

National Environmental Policy Act. Oil and gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment of the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. This process has the potential to delay or even halt development of some of our oil and gas projects.
