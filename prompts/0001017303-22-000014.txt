Item 1. Business.
The Company
 TransAct Technologies Incorporated (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “TransAct,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in June 1996 and began operating as a stand-alone business in August 1996 as a spin-off of the printer business that was formerly conducted by certain subsidiaries of Tridex Corporation.  We completed an initial public offering on August 22, 1996.
 
TransAct is a global leader in developing and selling software-driven technology and printing solutions for high growth markets including food service technology, point of sale (“POS”) automation and casino and gaming.  Our world-class products are designed from the ground up based on market and customer requirements and are sold under the BOHA!™, AccuDate™, Epic, EPICENTRAL® Ithaca®, and Printrex® brand names.  During 2019, we launched a new line of products for the food service technology market, the BOHA! branded suite of cloud-based applications and companion hardware solutions.  The BOHA! software and hardware products help restaurants, convenience stores and food service operators of all sizes automate food production in the back-of-house operations.  Known and respected worldwide for innovative designs and real-world service reliability, our thermal printers and terminals generate top-quality labels, coupons and transaction records such as receipts, tickets and other documents, as well as printed logging and plotting of data.  We sell our technology to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), value-added resellers, select distributors and directly to end-users.  Our product distribution spans across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean Islands and the South Pacific. We also offer world-class service, support, labels, spare parts, accessories and printing supplies to our growing worldwide base of products currently in use by our customers. Through our TransAct Services Group (“TSG”), we provide a complete range of supplies and consumables used in the printing activities of customers in the restaurant and hospitality, retail, casino and gaming, government and oil and gas exploration markets.  Through our webstore, www.transactsupplies.com, and our direct selling team, we address the demand for these products. Our primary operating, hardware research and development, and U.S. service center is located in Ithaca, New York.  In addition, we have a casino and gaming sales headquarters and software research and development in Las Vegas, Nevada; a European sales and service center at our subsidiary in the United Kingdom (“UK”); and a sales office located in Macau, China.  Our executive offices are located at One Hamden Center, 2319 Whitney Avenue, Suite 3B, Hamden, Connecticut, 06518, with a telephone number of (203) 859-6800.
  

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
 During the first two months of 2020 our business trends were in line with internal expectations; however, the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the United States and global economy increased significantly as the first quarter of 2020 progressed and continued throughout the remainder of 2020 and into 2021.  Though we have begun to experience some recovery during 2021, unfortunately, the massive economic and social disruptions across the world persist due to COVID-19, including the emergence of virus variants, and the measures implemented to mitigate its spread.  The food service, casino and gaming, and oil and gas industries have been particularly affected by the pandemic, and we expect such disruptions to continue to negatively impact our overall business for the foreseeable future.
 
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures implemented to mitigate its spread, we experienced decreased demand for our products and lower than anticipated sales beginning in the second half of March 2020 and continuing through 2021, particularly in our food service technology and casino and gaming markets.  We experienced some improvement in demand during the second half of 2020 through 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020, as state and local governments lifted certain measures implemented earlier in 2020 to mitigate the spread of the virus, but demand remained lower than 2019.  While we expect this improvement to continue during 2022, the exact timing and pace of recovery is unknown.  We have also experienced supply chain disruptions, including delayed product shipments from our two contract manufacturers located in Thailand and China that conduct almost all of our printer and BOHA! hardware manufacturing, due to reduced operations and part shortages at these facilities.  Our inventory levels decreased significantly during 2021 due to these supply chain disruptions and if these delays are sustained or additional disruptions occur we may have insufficient inventory levels and our ability to deliver products to our customers on time or at all may be impaired.  Below is a discussion of the impact we have experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic, and that we believe will continue to experience for the foreseeable future in each of our markets.
 
Food service technology and POS automation.  In both our food service technology and POS automation markets, many restaurants and food service establishments that were closed during much of the second quarter of 2020 started to reopen in the third quarter of 2020 as state and local governments began to ease restrictions put in place in response to the pandemic.  Many of our customers initially opened under restrictions that limited them to providing drive-through, take-out or delivery service without dine-in options, as well as limiting the volume of customers and employees on site at any one time.  During the second half of 2020 and throughout 2021 as these food service customers reopened for business, we experienced sales improvement compared to the second quarter of 2020.  However, during the fourth quarter of 2020 and early in 2021, restaurants were again impacted by a resurgence of the pandemic.  Notwithstanding the gradual resumption of operations that began in the third quarter of 2020, our food service technology and POS automation customers continue to recover from the financial impact of the pandemic and we expect new capital expenditures to be a lower priority for them in the near term, which we believe will continue to negatively impact sales of BOHA! hardware, software and label products, as well as sales of POS printers.  However, food service providers have been and are likely to continue to be required to develop and implement new or enhanced policies and operating procedures regarding cleaning, sanitizing and social distancing to ensure the safety of their employees and customers.  Additionally, our markets have experienced labor shortages and inflation in their food and labor costs.  We believe that our BOHA! hardware, software and label products could prove to be helpful to our food service customers in efficiently and effectively managing and complying with these new procedures, while also helping to overcome staffing issues and inflation, especially as many establishments are and will likely continue to be operating with reduced staff levels due to the continuing labor shortage.
 
Casino and gaming.   In the casino and gaming market, most casinos and other gaming establishments were closed worldwide during most of the second quarter of 2020.  Many casinos began to reopen in late May and early June 2020, but similar to restaurants, casino openings were slow and measured, starting with reduced capacity and limited gameplay based on social distancing guidelines.  During the fourth quarter of 2020, some casinos re-closed due to a resurgence of the pandemic.  However, many casinos in the U.S. reopened during the first quarter of 2021 with limited capacity and continued to remain open and further expand capacity during the remainder of 2021.  We anticipate that casinos will continue to increase capacity over time, barring any new closures or reduced capacity requirements in response to any new resurgence of the pandemic, including the emergence of variants.  Though sales of our casino and gaming products increased during 2021, and we expect this trend to continue into 2022,  casinos continue to recover from the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore we expect that certain casinos’ appetite for purchases of new slot machines may be diminished, which may negatively impact sales of casino and gaming printers purchased by slot manufacturers for use in slot machines at casinos during 2022.
 
Lottery.  We exited the lottery market at the end of 2019 and IGT made a final purchase of our lottery printer during the second quarter of 2020.  Therefore, COVID-19 has not had an impact on our lottery printer sales, and we do not anticipate that it will have an impact on our future lottery printer sales.
Printrex.  The oil and gas market was negatively impacted by the decline in worldwide oil prices attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.  During the latter half 2021, oil and gas prices began to rise again, resulting in slowly improving sales to our oil and gas customers.  However, we made a strategic decision to exit the Printrex market as of December 31, 2021 and expect to have no future sales in this market beyond 2021.
TSG.  Due to closures and reduced operating capacity of restaurants, retail establishments, casinos and other gaming establishments resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of spare parts, service and consumable products have declined, and we expect such sales to remain at reduced levels, due to lower usage while customers continue to recover from the impact of the pandemic.
 
Our gross margin has been negatively impacted and we expect our gross margin to continue to be negatively impacted while the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic effects on the markets we serve persists.  As a result of an expected lower sales level, as well as increased material and shipping costs resulting from worldwide supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe our gross margin will remain lower than pre-pandemic levels due to fixed manufacturing overhead expenses (such as facility costs, depreciation, etc.) that cannot be reduced or eliminated even with the lower sales level.
 
 


While we began to experience a modest recovery starting in the second half of 2020 and continuing into 2021 and expect this recovery to continue during 2022, the exact timing and pace of recovery is unknown given uncertainty surrounding responsive measures to potential future resurgences of the virus, vaccination rates, the emergence of virus variants and the significant disruption that our customers and suppliers have already experienced and may continue to experience.  In light of this uncertainty, we implemented a number of cost saving measures during 2020 to help mitigate the impact on our financial position and operations and continued to limit discretionary spending during 2021.
 
In addition to the expense management actions implemented during 2020, we took the following actions to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position:
 

● | Public Offerings – On October 16, 2020 and August 16, 2021, the Company raised net proceeds of $8.7 million and $11.2 million (including the exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment options on October 16, 2020 and August 20, 2021), respectively, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, through underwritten public offerings and sold an aggregate of 1,380,000 and 842,375 shares of common stock, respectively. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | PPP Loan – On May 1, 2020, the Company was granted a $2.2 million loan (the “PPP Loan”) under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) administered by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) established under Division A, Title I of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, which enabled us to return employees we furloughed earlier in 2020 to full time employment and to restore employees to full pay following certain pay cuts. On July 8, 2021, we received notice that the PPP Loan had been forgiven as of July 1, 2021. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Employee Retention Credit – Under the provisions of the CARES Act, the Company is eligible for a refundable employee retention credit subject to certain criteria. In connection with the CARES Act, the Company recognized the employee retention credit during the fourth quarter of 2021 and recorded $1.5 million as “Gain from employee retention credit” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the related receivable as “Employee retention credit receivable”” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021. We expect to receive these funds during 2022. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New Credit Facility – On March 13, 2020, we entered into a new credit facility with Siena Lending Group LLC that provides a revolving credit line of up to $10.0 million, subject to a borrowing base. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced Capital Expenditures – We limited capital expenditures during 2020 and gradually increased expenses during 2021 as our sales improved.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Since the onset of the pandemic, our top priority has been to ensure the health and safety of our employees while continuing to provide our customers with high-quality, personalized service.  On March 20, 2020, we instituted work-from-home practices for the majority of our employees to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and to comply with government mandates.  Because most of our employees already had laptop computers with remote access into our IT systems, we experienced only minor reductions in productivity and minimal costs related to the implementation of our work-from-home practices.  In addition, even with the move to a work-from-home environment, our internal control structure remained operational and unchanged.
 
As of October 4, 2021, all of our employees were fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and, as a result, we implemented a return-to-work plan, reopening all of our facilities and ending our work-from-home practices.  Our distribution centers, deemed an essential service, remained operational throughout the pandemic.  During 2020, we implemented new COVID-19 policies, most of which were still in place prior to ending our work-from-home practices, to specifically address health and safety guidelines for employees to adhere to and follow when at work.  These policies were based on the COVID-19 safety guidelines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 
We have evaluated the recoverability of the assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021 in accordance with relevant authoritative accounting literature. We considered the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including lower than previously forecasted sales and customer demand and macroeconomic factors potentially impacting accounts receivable, inventory, investments, intangible assets, goodwill and other assets and liabilities.  Where forward-looking estimates are required, we made a good-faith estimate based on information available as of the balance sheet date. We have continued to monitor for indicators of impairment through the date of this Report and reflected accordingly in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is no assurance that the actions we have taken in response to the pandemic are sufficient or adequate, and we may be required to take additional preventive or responsive measures, as the ultimate extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows are uncertain and are dependent on evolving developments which cannot be predicted at this time.  See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K for further discussion of risks related to COVID-19.
  


Products, Services and Distribution Methods
 
Printers, terminals and other hardware: TransAct designs, develops and markets a broad array of transaction-based and specialty printers and terminals utilizing thermal printing technology for applications, primarily in the food service technology, POS automation, casino and gaming, and prior to exiting the market on December 31, 2021, the oil and gas printing markets.  Our printers and terminals are configurable and offer customers the ability to choose from a variety of features and functions.  Options typically include interface configuration, mounting configuration, paper cutting devices, paper handling capacities and cabinetry color.  Our food service technology terminals also offer software configurable menu options.  Our food service technology market also includes sales of hardware products including temperature probes, temperature sensors and gateways.
 
Food Service Technology (“FST”): The primary offering in the FST market is our BOHA! ecosystem, which combines our latest generation terminal/workstation, cloud-based software applications and related hardware into a unique solution to automate back-of-house operations in restaurants, convenience stores and food service operations.  The software component of BOHA! consists of a suite of software-as-a-service (“SaaS”)-based applications, including applications for temperature monitoring of food and equipment, timers, food safety labeling, media libraries, checklists and task lists and equipment service management.  Any and all of these applications can be chosen by our customer and packaged into a single platform with the associated hardware, which includes the BOHA! terminal, handheld devices, tablets, temperature probes and temperature sensors and gateways. The BOHA! terminal combines the software and hardware components in a device that includes an operating system, touchscreen and one or two thermal print mechanisms that print easy-to-read food rotation labels, grab-and-go labels for prepared foods, nutritional labels and “enjoy by” date labels.  The BOHA! Workstation is a hardware device that pairs two mechanisms with an Apple iPad utilizing an iOS operating system.  Both the BOHA! terminal and BOHA! workstation are equipped with the TransAct Enterprise Management System to ensure that only approved applications and functions are available on the device and allows over-the-air updates to the applications and operating system.  BOHA! helps food service establishments and restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, fast casual and quick-serve restaurants, convenience stores, hospitality establishments and contract food service providers) effectively manage food safety and grab-and-go initiatives, as well as automate and manage back-of-house operations.  Recurring revenue from BOHA! is generated by software sales, including software subscriptions that are charged to customers upfront on a per-application basis, as well as sales of labels, extended warranty and service contracts, and technical support services.  In the food service technology market, we use an internal sales force to solicit sales directly from end users.
 
POS automation: In the POS market, we sell a printer utilizing thermal printing technology.  Our POS printer is used primarily by McDonald’s, and to a lesser extent, other quick-serve restaurants located either at the checkout counter or within self-service kiosks to print receipts for consumers or print on linerless labels.  In the POS market, we primarily sell our products through a network of domestic and international distributors and resellers.  We use an internal sales force to manage sales through our distributors and resellers, as well as to solicit sales directly from end-users.
 
Casino and gaming:  We sell several models of printers used in slot machines and video lottery terminals (“VLTs”) and other gaming machines that print tickets or receipts instead of issuing coins (“ticket-in, ticket-out” or “TITO”) at casinos, racetracks and other gaming venues worldwide.  These printers utilize thermal printing technology to print tickets and receipts in monochrome and offer various other features such as jam resistant bezels and a dual port interface that enables casinos to print coupons and promotions.  In addition, we sell printers using thermal roll-fed printing technology for use in international non-casino establishments, including game types such as Amusements with Prizes, Skills with Prizes, Fixed Odds Betting Terminals, sports betting establishments and other off-premise gaming type machines around the world.  We sell our casino and gaming products primarily (1) to slot machine manufacturers, who incorporate our printers into slot machines and, in turn, sell completed slot machines directly to casinos and other gaming establishments and (2) through distributors.  We also maintain a dedicated internal sales force to solicit sales from slot machine manufacturers and casinos, and to manage sales through our distributors.
 
We also offer a software solution, the EPICENTRAL Print System, including annual software maintenance, that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them in real time at the slot machine. With EPICENTRAL, casinos can utilize the system to create multiple promotions and incentives to either increase customer time spent on the casino floor or encourage additional visits to generate more revenue to the casinos.
 
Lottery:  Our lottery printers were designed for high-volume, high-speed printing of lottery tickets for various lottery applications.  We previously sold lottery printers to International Gaming Technology and its subsidiaries (“IGT”), our largest customer and the world’s largest provider of lottery terminals.  During 2019, we decided to exit this business and we expect no future sales beyond 2020.  Sales of our lottery products were made directly to IGT and were managed by an internal sales representative before we exited the business in 2019.
 
Printrex:  Printrex printers include wide format, desktop and rack-mounted and vehicle-mounted black and white thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field, seismic and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry.  The Printrex brand of printers also includes high-speed color inkjet desktop printers used by oil and gas field service companies to print logs at data centers of the oil and gas field service companies.  We primarily sell our Printrex products directly to oil field service and drilling companies and OEM’s, as well as through regional distributors in the United States, Europe, Canada and Asia.  During  2021, we decided to exit this business and in the fourth quarter of 2021 fulfilled last buy orders to our legacy customers.  We expect no future sales of our Printrex products beyond 2021.
 
TSG:  Through TSG, we proactively market the sale of consumable products (including POS receipt paper, ribbons and other printing supplies), replacement parts, maintenance and repair services, and shipping and handling charges.  Our maintenance services include the sale of extended warranties, multi-year maintenance contracts, a 24-hour guaranteed replacement product service called TransAct Xpress™ and other repair services for our non-FST products.  Within the United States, we provide repair services through our service center in Ithaca, New York.  Internationally, we provide repair services through our European service center located in Doncaster, UK, and through partners strategically located around the world.
  

We also provide customers with telephone sales and technical support, and a personal account representative to handle orders, shipping and general information.  Technical and sales support personnel receive training on all our manufactured products and services.  In addition to personalized telephone and technical support, we also market and sell consumable products 24 hours a day, seven days a week, via our webstore, www.transactsupplies.com.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 We design our products to optimize product performance, quality, reliability and durability.  These designs combine cost efficient materials, sourcing and assembly methods with high standards of workmanship.  Almost all of our printers and terminals are produced by two third-party manufacturers located in Thailand and China.  A small portion of our products are assembled in our Ithaca, New York facility largely on a configure-to-order basis using components and subassemblies that have been sourced from vendors and contract manufacturers around the world.
 
We procure component parts and subassemblies for use in the assembly of our hardware products in Ithaca, New York.  Critical component parts and subassemblies include thermal print heads, printing/cutting mechanisms, power supplies, motors, injection molded plastic parts, LCD screens, circuit boards and electronic components, which are obtained from domestic and foreign suppliers at competitive prices.  As a result of the majority of our production being performed by our contract manufacturers, the majority of our purchases consist of fully-assembled printers and terminals produced by our contract manufacturers and, to a much lesser extent, component parts.  We typically strive to maintain more than one source for our component parts, subassemblies and fully assembled printers and terminals to reduce the risk of parts shortages or unavailability.  However, we could experience temporary disruption if certain suppliers ceased doing business with us, as described below.
 
We currently buy a majority of our thermal print mechanisms, an important component of our thermal printers, and fully assembled printers for several of our printer and food service technology terminal models, from one foreign contract manufacturer in Thailand and to a lesser extent, one other foreign contract manufacturer in China.  Although we believe that other contract manufacturers could provide similar thermal print mechanisms or fully assembled printers and terminals, on comparable terms, a change in contract manufacturers could cause a delay in manufacturing and possible loss of sales, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.  Although we do not have supply agreements with our foreign contract manufacturers, our relationship with both remain strong and we have no reason to believe that either will discontinue their supply of thermal print mechanisms or fully assembled printers to us during 2022 or that their terms to us will be substantially less favorable than they have been historically.  Due to the impact from Chinese tariffs starting in 2019, during 2020 and 2021, we increasingly transferred production from our contract manufacturer in China to our contract manufacturer in Thailand.  We plan to continue transferring production to our Thailand-based contract manufacturer during 2022.
 
Patents and Proprietary Information
 TransAct relies on a combination of trade secrets, patents, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws and contractual rights to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products.  As of February 28, 2022, we hold 37 United States and 33 foreign patents and have 3 foreign patent applications pending pertaining to our products.  The remaining duration of these patents ranges from 1 to 18 years.  The expiration of any individual patent would not have a significant negative impact on our business.  We regard certain manufacturing processes and designs to be proprietary and attempt to protect them through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and similar means.  It may be possible for unauthorized third-parties to copy certain portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use, to our detriment, information that we regard as proprietary.  Moreover, the laws of some foreign countries do not afford the same protection to our proprietary rights as do the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that legal protections we rely upon to protect our proprietary position will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies.
Trademarks, Service Marks and Copyrights
 We own or have rights to trademarks, service marks, trade names and copyrights that we use in connection with the operation of our business, including our corporate names, logos and website names. Other trademarks, service marks and trade names appearing in this Form 10-K are the property of their respective owners.  The trademarks we own include TransAct®, BOHA!TM, AccuDate™, Epic, EPICENTRAL®, Ithaca® and Printrex®. Solely for convenience, some of the trademarks, service marks, trade names and copyrights referred to in this Form 10-K are listed without the ©, ® and ™ symbols, but we will assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights to our trademarks, service marks, trade names and copyrights.
Seasonality
 Restaurants typically reduce purchases of equipment in the fourth quarter due to the increased volume of transactions during the holiday period, which may negatively impact sales of our food service technology products or POS printers.
Working Capital
 Inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable levels, payment terms, and where applicable, return policies are in accordance with the general practices of the industry and standard business procedures.  See also Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Certain Significant Customers
 IGT is our most significant customer, although to a lesser extent than in previous years, and has been since 1995.  We sell casino and gaming printers and, prior to 2021, on-line lottery printers to IGT.  On May 29, 2015, we signed an agreement with IGT to sell on-line lottery and casino printers to IGT on a non-exclusive basis through December 31, 2019.   We decided not to renew the agreement upon its expiration and to exit the on-line lottery market.  Although we no longer have an agreement with IGT, we expect to continue selling casino and gaming printers to IGT, as well as spare parts for our remaining, but declining, installed base of lottery printers, in the future.
 
Sales to IGT represented 9% and 15% of our total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
Backlog
 Our backlog of firm orders was approximately $14.2 million as of February 28, 2022, compared to $3.4 million as of February 28, 2021.  The increase in firm orders as of February 28, 2022 compared to February 28, 2021 is due primarily to advance orders placed by our casino and gaming customers due to increased production lead time, resulting from worldwide supply chain shortages caused by the pandemic.  Based on customers’ current delivery requirements, we expect to fill and recognize as revenue $13.7 million of our current backlog during 2022, $0.4 million during 2023 and the remaining balance of the amount during 2024.
Competition
 The market for transaction-based and specialty printers and food service technology terminals is extremely competitive, and we expect such competition to continue in the future.  However, we experience less competition for EPICENTRAL software due to the highly customized nature of the product.  We compete with a number of companies, many of which have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than TransAct.  We believe our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control, including durability, reliability, quality, design capability, product customization, price, customer support, success in developing new products, manufacturing expertise and capacity, supply of component parts and materials, strategic relationships with suppliers, the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors, general market, economic and political conditions and, in some cases, the uniqueness of our products.
 
In the food service technology market, we primarily compete with Zenput, Squadle Inc., Jolt Software, Avery Dennison Corporation, Ecolab Inc., ITD Food Safety, CMC Daymark, Integrated Control Corp, Digi International, and Toast.  We compete in this market based largely on our ability to provide highly specialized software and purpose-built hardware products and ongoing technical support.  We rely upon third-party developed software and hosting services combined with our own proprietary hardware and software to offer a unique BOHA! branded solution to support back-of-house operations in the food service industry.  Our competitors or others may develop, or may establish relationships with developers with the capability to develop, software and services that are similar to or competitive with ours, which may be disadvantageous to our competitive position.  Certain portions of our food service technology software are licensed from a third-party developer on a non-exclusive basis through 2031 and are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with the developer. We are reliant upon the third-party developer to further develop and maintain its developed software, and the developer controls the software source code. The license agreement does not preclude the developer from working with others on similar products. Also, the third-party developer hosts the web-based applications.  Therefore, presently, we are highly dependent upon this third-party developer for continued service to our customers and the further development of our food service technology software products.
 
In the POS automation market, we primarily compete with Epson America, Inc., which holds a dominant market position.  We also compete, to a much lesser extent, with Star Micronics America, Inc. and Citizen -- CBM America Corporation.  Certain competitors of ours have greater financial resources and lower costs attributable to higher volume production which enables them to occasionally offer lower prices than us.  However, we will continue to deemphasize efforts in the POS automation market going forward as we have shifted our focus toward our higher-value, technology-enabled food service technology and casino and gaming products.
 
In the casino and gaming market (consisting principally of slot machine printing, VLT transaction printing and promotional coupon printing), we compete with several companies including JCM Global, Nanoptix, Inc., Custom Engineering SPA, Eurocoin and others.  Certain of our products sold for casino and gaming applications compete based upon our ability to provide highly specialized products, custom engineering and ongoing technical support.
 
In the lottery market (consisting principally of on-line lottery transaction printing), we competed with other lottery printer providers such as Custom Engineering SPA, Star Micronics and Wincor Nixdorf.  However, we exited the lottery market in 2019 and shifted our focus toward our higher-value, technology enabled food service technology and casino and gaming products.
 
In the oil and gas market, our Printrex products competed primarily with the products of Imaging Systems Group, Inc. and Neuralog Inc.  However, we exited the oil and gas market at the end of 2021 in order to shift our focus toward our higher-value, technology enabled food service technology and gaming products.
 
The market in which TSG competes is highly fragmented, and we compete with numerous competitors of various sizes, including POS and internet resellers and paper converters depending on the geographic area.
 
Our strategy for competing in our markets is to continually develop and/or license new products (hardware and software), such as launching BOHA! in 2019, and product line extensions that are technologically advanced and provide differentiated features and functions, to increase our market penetration, to take advantage of strategic relationships, and to lower the cost of our products by sourcing certain products overseas.  Although we believe that our products, operations and relationships provide a competitive foundation, there can be no assurance that we will compete successfully in the future.  In addition, our products utilize certain thermal printing technologies and licensed software.  If new technologies are introduced, or existing technologies evolve, we may be required to incorporate these technologies into our products.  Alternatively, if such technologies were to become available to our competitors, our products could become obsolete, which could have a significant negative impact on our business.
  

Environmental Compliance
 Our compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and discharge of hazardous materials has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and we do not anticipate any material impact from such compliance in the future.
