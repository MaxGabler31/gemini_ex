Item 1.    Business.
 
General and Historical Development
 
Resources was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia on July 31, 1998 and, effective July 1, 1999, its subsidiaries were reorganized into the Resources holding company structure. Resources is currently composed of the following subsidiaries: Roanoke Gas, Midstream and Diversified Energy.
 
Roanoke Gas, originally established in 1883, was organized as a public service corporation under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1912. The principal service of Roanoke Gas is the distribution and sale of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers within its service territory in Roanoke, Virginia and the surrounding localities. Roanoke Gas also provides certain non-regulated services which account for less than 1% of consolidated revenues.
 
In July 2015, the Company formed Midstream for the purpose of becoming a 1% investor in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC. The LLC was created to construct and operate interstate natural gas pipelines. Additional information regarding this investment is provided under Note 5 of the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and under the Equity Investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline section of Item 7.
 
Diversified Energy is currently inactive.
 
Services
 
Roanoke Gas maintains an integrated natural gas distribution system to deliver natural gas purchased from suppliers to residential, commercial and industrial users in its service territory. The schedule below is a summary of customers, delivered volumes (expressed in DTHs), revenues and margin as a percentage of the total for each category. For the purposes of this schedule, margin for the utility operations is defined as revenues less cost of gas.

Roanoke Gas’ regulated natural gas distribution business accounted for more than 99% of Resources total revenues for fiscal years ending September 30, 2022 and 2021. The tables above indicate that residential customers represent over 91% of the Company’s customer total; however, they represent less than 40% of the total gas volumes delivered and more than half of the Company’s consolidated revenues and margin. Industrial customers include primarily transportation customers that purchase their natural gas requirements directly from a supplier other than the Company and utilize Roanoke Gas’ natural gas distribution system for delivery to their operations. Most of the revenue billed for these customers relates only to transportation service, and not to the purchase of natural gas, causing total revenues generated by these deliveries to be less than 10%, although they represent more than 30% of total natural gas volumes and approximately 11% of margin for the years presented.

The Company’s revenues are affected by changes in gas costs, changes in consumption volume due to weather and economic conditions and changes in the non-gas portion of customer billing rates. Increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas are passed on to customers through the PGA mechanism as explained in Note 1 of the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements.
 
The Company’s residential and commercial sales are primarily seasonal and subject to temperature sensitivity as the majority of the gas sold by Roanoke Gas to these customers is used for heating. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, approximately 62% of the Company’s total DTH of natural gas deliveries and 74% of the residential and commercial deliveries were made in the five-month period of November through March.
 
Roanoke Gas relies on multiple interstate pipelines including those operated by Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation, LLC and Columbia Gulf Transmission Corporation, LLC (together “Columbia”), and East Tennessee Natural Gas, LLC (“East Tennessee”), Tennessee Gas Pipeline, Midwestern Gas Transmission Company and Saltville Gas Storage Company, LLC ("Saltville"), to transport natural gas from the production and storage fields to Roanoke Gas’ distribution system. Roanoke Gas is directly served by two pipelines, Columbia and East Tennessee. Columbia historically has delivered more than 65% of the Company’s required gas supply, with East Tennessee delivering the balance. The rates paid for interstate natural gas transportation and storage services are established by tariffs approved by FERC. The current pipeline and storage contracts expire at various times from 2023 to 2028. The Company anticipates being able to renew these contracts or enter into other contracts to meet customers’ existing demand for natural gas.
 
The Company manages its pipeline contracts and LNG facility in order to provide for sufficient capacity to meet the current natural gas demands of its customers. The maximum daily winter capacity available for delivery into Roanoke Gas’ distribution system from the current interstate pipelines is 78,606 DTH per day. The LNG facility is capable of storing up to 200,000 DTH of natural gas in a liquid state for use during peak demand. Combined, the pipelines and LNG facility may provide up to 103,606 DTH on a single winter day.
 
The Company currently contracts with Sequent Energy Management, L.P. to manage its pipeline transportation, storage rights, gas supply inventories and deliveries and serve as the primary supplier of natural gas for Roanoke Gas. Natural gas purchased under the asset management agreement is priced at indexed-based market prices as reported in major industry pricing publications. The current Sequent contract was extended to March 31, 2025.
 
The Company uses summer storage programs to supplement heating season gas supply requirements. The Company has contracted for 2.4 million DTH of storage capacity from Columbia, Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Saltville in addition to the capacity available at the Company's LNG facility. The balance of the Company’s annual natural gas requirements are met primarily through market purchases made by its asset manager.
 
Competition
 
The Company’s natural gas utility operates in a regulated, monopolistic environment. Roanoke Gas currently holds the only franchises and/or CPCNs to distribute natural gas in its Virginia service areas. These franchises generally extend for multi-year periods and are renewable by the municipalities, including exclusive franchises in the cities of Roanoke and Salem and the Town of Vinton, Virginia. All three franchise agreements were renewed for a 20-year term, set to expire December 31, 2035. In 2019, the SCC issued a final order granting a CPCN to furnish gas to all of Franklin County. Unlike the CPCNs for the other counties served by Roanoke Gas, the Franklin County CPCN will terminate within five years of the date of the order if Roanoke Gas does not furnish gas service to the designated service area. Roanoke Gas plans to serve the Franklin County area with natural gas delivered through the MVP, once MVP is placed into service.
 
Management anticipates that the Company will be able to renew all of its franchises prior to their current expiration date; however, there can be no assurance that a given jurisdiction will not refuse to renew a franchise or will not, in connection with the renewal of a franchise, attempt to impose restrictions or conditions that could adversely affect the Company’s business operations or financial condition. CPCNs, issued by the SCC, are generally of perpetual duration and subject to compliance with regulatory standards.

Although Roanoke Gas has exclusive rights for the distribution of natural gas in its service area, the Company competes with suppliers of other forms of energy such as fuel oil, electricity, propane, coal, wind and solar. Competition can be intense among the other energy sources with price being the primary consideration. This is particularly true for those industrial applications that have the ability to switch to alternative fuels. The relationship between supply and demand has the greatest impact on the price of natural gas. Greater demand for natural gas for electric generation and other uses can provide upward pressure on the price of natural gas. Increased demand, including off-shore LNG shipments, and lower storage levels are placing upward pressure on the price of natural gas.
 
Competition from renewable energy sources such as solar and wind is likely to increase as the political environment currently favors these energy sources through incentives or by placing restrictions on emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Nevertheless, the Company continues to see a demand for natural gas. Growth in residential and commercial service has been steady as the Company continues to grow its customer base through a combination of extending distribution service and converting other energy users to natural gas.
 
Regulation
 
In addition to the regulatory requirements generally applicable to all companies, Roanoke Gas is also subject to additional regulation at the federal, state and local levels. At the federal level, the Company is subject to pipeline safety regulations issued by the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.
 
At the state level, the SCC performs regulatory oversight including the approval of rates and other charges for natural gas sold to customers, the approval of agreements between or among affiliated companies involving the provision of goods and services, pipeline safety and certain other corporate activities of the Company, including mergers and acquisitions related to utility operations.
 
At the local level, Roanoke Gas is further regulated by the municipalities and localities that grant franchises for the placement of gas distribution pipelines and the operation of gas distribution networks within their jurisdictions.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
At September 30, 2022, Resources had 96 full-time employees.  During fiscal 2022, Roanoke Gas notified the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied-Industrial International Union, Local No. 515 (the "Union") representing Company employees of its intent to withdraw recognition of the Union upon expiration of the current agreement.  Effective August 1, 2022, the collective bargaining agreement between the Union and Roanoke Gas expired and the Union, due to the sustained lack of majority support by bargaining unit members, accepted the Company's withdrawal of recognition and disclaimed its interest in serving as the exclusive collective-bargaining representative of employees of Roanoke Gas.  Prior to the expiration of the contract, 16 employees were represented by the Union. Employees had been represented by a union since 1952.
 
The Company’s business strategy and ability to serve customers relies on employing talented professionals and attracting, training, developing and retaining a skilled workforce. This is particularly relevant as the Company continues to face retirements of key personnel over the next several years.  Like many employers, Resources has been challenged at filling key positions but has been successful in engaging the necessary qualified personnel to fill vacancies by reviewing and adjusting its compensation package to remain competitive in the current market environment.
 
With respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company continues to evaluate and implement its pandemic plan to ensure the continuation of safe and reliable service to customers and to maintain the safety of the Company's employees.
