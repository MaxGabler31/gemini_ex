 ITEM 1.     BUSINESS 
 
Overview
 
Founded in 1932 and incorporated in Delaware in 1989, Ethan Allen Interiors Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ethan Allen Global, Inc., and Ethan Allen Global, Inc.’s subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Ethan Allen” or the “Company”), is a leading interior design company, manufacturer and retailer in the home furnishings marketplace. We are a global luxury home fashion brand that is vertically integrated from product design through home delivery, which offers our customers stylish product offerings, artisanal quality, and personalized service. As we celebrate 90 years of innovation, we continue to be known for the quality and craftsmanship of our products as well as for the exceptional personal service from design to delivery, and for our commitment to social responsibility and sustainable operations. We provide complimentary interior design service to our clients and sell a full range of home furnishing products through a retail network of design centers located throughout the United States and abroad as well as online at ethanallen.com.
 
Our employees, which we refer to as associates, are dedicated to helping each customer create a place that they will love to come home to everyday. We operate our business with an entrepreneurial attitude, staying focused on long-term growth, and treating our associates, vendors, and customers with dignity and justice, which we believe is critical to remaining both profitable and relevant amidst the constant changes taking place in the world.
 
Ethan Allen design centers represent a mix of locations operated by independent licensees and Company-operated locations. As of June 30, 2022, the Company operates 141 retail design centers with 137 located in the United States and four in Canada. Our independently-operated design centers are located in the United States, Asia, the Middle East and Europe. We also own and operate ten manufacturing facilities, including four manufacturing plants, one sawmill, one rough mill and one kiln dry lumberyard in the United States, two manufacturing plants in Mexico and one manufacturing plant in Honduras. Approximately 75% of our products are manufactured in our North American manufacturing plants and we also partner with various suppliers located in Europe, Asia, and other countries to produce products that support our business. During fiscal 2022, we reaffirmed our commitment to maintain and grow our North American workshops, where our customization capabilities help create relevant and quality products and have proven to provide us with a strategic and a branding advantage.

Our strong network of North American interior design professionals continues to create design solutions that best satisfy our customers’ needs. We believe changes in consumer spending and new habits being formed as a result of the global coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic has created opportunities for our brand. We continue to generate business through our retail design center network and by interacting virtually with our customers through ethanallen.com.
 
Our unique combination of personal service and technology enhances the customers’ Ethan Allen experience. By investing in digital design technologies, we have expanded our virtual design appointment capabilities. Most recently, in June 2022, we debuted a state-of-the-art immersive Virtual Design Center, which showcases the timeless aesthetic of Ethan Allen’s vast product portfolio while fostering collaboration between our interior designers and our customers. Clients can access our home furnishings while either co-browsing live with an Ethan Allen interior designer or browsing on their own, at their own pace. Clients can view items in 3D, read product details, share, and save item lists, and utilize augmented reality views in their homes, either via a QR code on their desktop or directly when browsing on a mobile device. In addition to the Virtual Design Center, we continue to leverage EA inHome®, an augmented reality mobile app, which empowers clients to preview Ethan Allen products in their homes, at scale, in a variety of fabrics and finishes. With the 3D Room Planner, our designers generate both 2D floor plans and immersive, realistic 3D walk-throughs of the interior designs they create. All of these technologies have been pivotal to our ability to service clients and provide even more ways for us to collaborate and create a timely and exceptional experience. With so much of our product customizable, we encourage our customers to get personal help from our interior design professionals either in person or by chatting online. This complimentary direct contact with one of our knowledgeable interior design professionals, whether remotely or in-person, creates a competitive advantage as well as enhances the online experience and regularly leads to internet customers becoming customers.
 
Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
 
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt several segments of the economy and has caused, and continues to cause, impact to our business. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and for the protection of our associates and customers, we implemented, and continue to monitor, certain business continuity plans to ensure the ongoing availability of our products and services, while prioritizing health and safety measures, including enhanced cleaning and hygiene protocols as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”). During fiscal 2021 all temporary salary reductions were lifted and the majority of our associates previously furloughed returned. All of our Company-operated retail design centers and manufacturing facilities are fully reopened and our Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors” or “Board”) reinstated the regular quarterly dividend in August 2020 and declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share. We repaid $50 million of our outstanding borrowings in fiscal 2021 leaving no remaining debt.
 
All of our retail design centers had reopened by fiscal 2021 and since that time, we have experienced strong demand for our products as customers allocated greater amounts of discretionary spending to home furnishings than at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since our manufacturing facilities re-opened in May 2020, we have ramped up and increased production capacity by adding headcount as well as second shifts and weekend production shifts to our North American plants. In addition, during the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed the purchase of property, plant and equipment from Dimension Wood Products, Inc. to further increase our control over raw materials, purchased parts, and labor costs while maintaining our high-quality standards. 
 
Impact on Health and Safety. In response to COVID-19, we implemented certain business continuity plans and health and safety measures to ensure the ongoing availability of our services, while also protecting our associates and customers. Such measures included temporarily closing our design centers and most of our manufacturing plants during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, implementing enhanced cleaning and hygiene protocols as recommended by the CDC, and implementing remote work policies for our associates, wherever possible. As we worked to safely reopen our design centers and other facilities, we put COVID-19 prevention protocols in place to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our workplaces. These protocols, which remain in place, meet or exceed the CDC guidelines and where applicable, state mandates. Our associates were trained on these protocols prior to or upon returning to work. We established logistics for the supply of hand sanitizer and related dispensers, disinfectant cleaning supplies and masks and nitrile gloves, increased ventilation and air filtration, instituted physical distance requirements, where applicable, and increased the cleaning frequency. We also work closely with our associates to identify team members who were in close contact with an ill colleague in the workplace and instituted procedures to help contain the spread of COVID-19. As of June 30, 2022, we have been fortunate to experience a limited number of cases of COVID-19 throughout our enterprise, each of which resulted in no significant disruptions to our operations.

Impact on the Supply Chain. We have seen a significant improvement in business conditions, which has contributed to increased production, profitability and strong positive cash flow during each of the last two fiscal years. Tempering these improvements are the continuing logistical challenges that we, as well as the entire home furnishings industry, have faced resulting from COVID-19-related labor shortages and supply chain disruptions creating significant delays in order fulfillment and increasing order backlogs. We continue to focus on our inventory and supply chain management as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory shortage and obsolescence. We continue to produce approximately 75% of our products in our North American manufacturing facilities with the remaining 25% being imported. The receipt of inventory and raw materials imported improved during fiscal 2022 and we have begun to see relief from ocean freight capacity issues, which has resulted in moderate price decreases per shipping container. While we have started to see lower ocean freight container rates during the second half of fiscal 2022, we believe these rates will not return to pre-COVID-19 levels in the near-term.
Impact on Raw Material Prices. During fiscal 2022, the prices of raw materials we use in our upholstery manufacturing process, such as foam and springs, and in our case goods manufacturing process, such as logs and lumber, increased due to COVID-19 related supply chain challenges that limited supply during a time of higher demand for raw materials in various manufacturing sectors, including the home building and home furnishings industries due to increased consumer purchasing and inflationary cost pressure. The short-term dynamics of supply and demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a surge in new homes and renovations also resulted in lumber prices significantly increasing across North America. While we have seen certain raw material prices moderate during fiscal 2022, we expect raw material prices to remain at high levels in many categories due to price inflation and global supply chain complexities. In addition, as commodity prices (notably, fuel costs) remain elevated, we will continue to evaluate whether further price increases to our customers to offset these costs are warranted. To the extent that we experience further raw material price increases, we may increase our selling prices to offset the impact. However, increases in selling prices may not fully mitigate the impact of raw material cost increases which would adversely impact operating profits. We expect raw material prices to remain at historically high levels in many categories due to price inflation in our core materials and global supply chain complexities. We expect that COVID-19 related issues will continue to introduce uncertainty into many markets, especially with respect to freight and labor availability.
Impact on Backlog. During fiscal 2021, we experienced unprecedented demand driving a 31.7% increase in wholesale written orders, which outpaced production. The combination of increasing manufacturing production capacity with slowing consumer demand, resulted in our wholesale delivered shipments exceeding written orders during fiscal 2022, which reduced lead times between order and delivery. As a result, our wholesale backlog declined to $102.4 million as of June 30, 2022, down 14.7% from $120.0 million a year ago. However, due to the continued strong order demand, our current level of wholesale backlog still remains high when compared to historical levels. Wholesale order backlog is up 120.8% compared to June 30, 2019. We will continue to work through this existing order backlog during fiscal 2023, but are unable to reasonably predict the timing and size of reductions to our backlog.
Impact on Seasonality. During the last two fiscal years our sales volume and production schedules did not follow typical trends due to the impact of COVID-19. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, COVID-19 led us to temporarily closing our retail design centers and most manufacturing facilities, which resulted in a significant decline in net sales that continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. After reopening all of our retail design centers and manufacturing facilities, we saw an increase in demand for our products and services. However, this increased demand was partially offset by supply chain disruptions and shipping container availability, which limited our ability to fully ramp up production and related sales throughout fiscal 2021. As a result of steps taken to increase our production capacity, our wholesale and retail segments both experienced their largest fiscal 2022 sales volume during the fourth quarter. Additionally, in fiscal 2023 we do not anticipate a return to historical pre-COVID-19 trends due to our high order backlog as of June 30, 2022. However, we do not expect this to be reflective of any long-term seasonal trends in the furniture industry or is an indicator that seasonal trends are permanently changing as it was primarily due to disruptions in the market caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Retention Credits. In taking advantage of the stimulus measures under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), during fiscal 2020, we recorded employee retention credits of $1.2 million representing eligible wages paid to employees affected by the cessation of our operations. No additional credits were taken during fiscal 2021 and 2022. We also elected to defer the employer-paid part of social security taxes beginning with pay dates on and after March 12, 2020. At June 30, 2021, we deferred a total of $3.9 million in employer-paid social security taxes, of which 50% was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet within Accounts payable and accrued expenses with the remaining balance in Other long-term liabilities because we were not required to pay any part of the deferred amount until December 31, 2021. The current portion of $1.9 million was subsequently paid in fiscal 2022. As of June 30, 2022 our remaining deferred employer-paid social security taxes was $1.9 million and reported within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet.

Continued Monitoring. Although we continue to actively manage the impact of COVID-19 and the prospect of continuing or future outbreaks, we are unable to predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial operations in the near- and long-term. We believe that we have a strong balance sheet with $121.1 million of cash and investments, no outstanding borrowings as of June 30, 2022, and a credit agreement that provides for a $125 million revolving credit facility, which we believe will provide sufficient liquidity to continue business operations in the long-term. We also continue to actively manage our global supply chain and manufacturing operations, which have been adversely impacted with respect to availability and pricing of raw materials and freight based on uncontrollable factors as well as COVID-19 related constraints on our manufacturing capacity as we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates. The need for, or timing of, any future actions in response to COVID-19 is largely dependent on the mitigation of the spread of the virus along with the adoption and continued effectiveness of vaccines, status of government orders, directives and guidelines, recovery of the business environment, global supply chain conditions, economic conditions, and consumer demand for our products, all of which are highly uncertain.
Product 
 
We design and build the majority of the products we sell through the craftmanship of artisans in our North American plants. All of our products are Ethan Allen branded. Most upholstery frames are hand-assembled and stitching is guided by hand. All case goods frames are made with premium lumber and veneers. We use best-in-class construction techniques, including mortise and tenon joinery and four-corner glued dovetail joinery on drawers. These factors continue to define Ethan Allen, positioning us as a quality and fashion leader in the home furnishing industry.
 
During fiscal 2022, we introduced several new products in upholstery, home office, lighting, outdoor living, decorative accents and a new flooring program. This important facet of our vertically integrated business enables us to control the design specifications and establish consistent levels of quality across all our product programs. In addition to our seven United States manufacturing facilities, we have two upholstery manufacturing plants in Mexico and a case goods manufacturing facility in Honduras. We selectively outsource the remaining 25% of our products, primarily from Asia. We carefully select our sourcing partners and require strict compliance with our specifications, quality and social responsibility standards. We believe that our strategic investments in our manufacturing facilities balanced with outsourcing from foreign and domestic suppliers will enable us to accommodate any significant future sales growth and allow us to maintain an appropriate degree of control over cost, quality and service to our customers.
 
Projection
 
The interiors of our design centers are organized to facilitate display of our products, both in room settings that project the category lifestyle, and by product grouping to facilitate comparisons of the styles and tastes of our customers. To further enhance the experience, we use technology to expand the range of products viewed by including content from our website and 3D digital images in applications used on large touch-screen flat panel displays.
 
We opened multiple new design centers during fiscal 2022 that showcase the Company’s unique vision of American style while combining complimentary interior design services with technology. During fiscal 2022, we opened new design centers in Westport, CT and Walnut Creek, CA, which both project the variety of our styles of classic design with a modern perspective and empowers clients to work with its professional interior designers at fully equipped workstations, viewing both before-and-after photos and 3D floor plans of single rooms or even entire homes. Large, high-resolution screens bring digital design plans to life, so clients can preview an incredibly realistic version of their designed space before placing an order. Customers are also able to view hundreds of fabrics, leathers, finishes, and other customized options on site; from room plan to furniture details, the experience is personalized.
 
Raw Materials and Supply Chain
 
The principal raw materials we use in manufacturing are lumber, logs, veneers, plywood, hardware, glue, finishing materials, glass, steel, fabrics, leather, frames, foam and filling material. The various types of wood used in our products include cherry, ash, oak, maple, prima vera, African mahogany, birch, rubber wood and poplar. These raw materials used for manufacturing are for cover (primarily fabrics and leather), polyester batting and polyurethane foam for cushioning and padding, lumber and plywood for frames, steel for motion mechanisms and various other metal components for fabrication of product.

  ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 


Fabrics and other raw materials are purchased both domestically and outside the United States. We purchase most of our cover in a raw state (fabric rolls or leather hides) from these suppliers, then cut and sew it into cover in our cut and sew facility in Mexico. We have no significant long-term supply contracts and believe we have sufficient alternate sources of supply to prevent significant long-term disruption in supplying our operations, despite the availability pressures of raw materials due to COVID-19, as described further below. Appropriate amounts of lumber and fabric inventory are typically stocked to maintain adequate production levels. We believe that our sources of supply for these materials are sufficient and that we are not dependent on any one supplier. If any of these suppliers experience financial or other difficulties, we believe we have alternative sources of supply to prevent temporary disruptions in our manufacturing process. We have been able to reduce our exposure to any one particular country or manufacturing hub through our unique vertical integration, which allows us to make approximately 75% of our products within our own North American manufacturing plants. This manufacturing structure leaves us with limited exposure to any one particular country on the other 25% that we import. We enter into standard purchase agreements with foreign and domestic suppliers to source selected products. The terms of these arrangements are customary for the industry and do not contain any long-term contractual obligations on our behalf. We select international partners who are as committed to quality and social responsibility as we are. We believe we maintain good relationships with our suppliers.
 
While we strive to maintain a number of sources for our raw materials, the impact of COVID-19 on raw materials and increased demand on our supply chain has created additional pricing and availability pressures. During fiscal 2022, the prices of materials we use in our upholstery manufacturing process, such as foam, plywood and springs, and in our case goods manufacturing process, such as logs, lumber and finishing materials, increased due to COVID-19 related supply chain challenges, higher demand for raw materials in manufacturing sectors, including the home furnishings industry, rapidly rising inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty and global unrest. Lumber prices and availability can also fluctuate over time based on various factors, including supply and demand and new home construction. The cost of some of our raw materials are also dependent on petroleum cost. Higher material prices, cost of petroleum, and costs of sourced products had an adverse effect on our fiscal 2022 margins.
 
While we experienced raw material price increases throughout fiscal 2022, we have begun to see more stabilization in many of our input costs. We expect to see further stability in the pricing of many input categories, however, due to continued price inflation and global supply chain complexities, we do not expect a material decrease or return to historical levels.
 
Imported Finished Goods
 
Imported finished goods represent approximately 25% of our consolidated sales and include the sale of home accents and certain case goods furniture. Accents include items such as window treatments and drapery hardware, wall décor, florals, lighting, clocks, mattresses, bedspreads, throws, pillows, decorative accents, area rugs, wall coverings and home and garden furnishings. We use select suppliers primarily to leverage our buying power, to control quality and product flow, and because their capabilities align with our product design needs. If any of these suppliers experience financial or other difficulties, we believe we have alternative sources of supply to prevent temporary disruptions in our imported product flow.
 
The prices paid for these imported products, which include inbound freight, increased in fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021, primarily due to constrained supply resulting from a combination of COVID-19, increased demand across the industry and higher shipping container costs, which were constrained during most of fiscal 2022. Elevated ocean freight container rates were from an imbalance in container supply driven by COVID-19 disruptions and elevated demand. However, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we started to see stabilization in container costs, and in some areas, moderate declines in prices per shipping container. The product pricing actions we took during fiscal 2022 on imported finished goods, including home accents and certain case goods, helped to offset higher overall product and freight costs associated with these categories. As we head into fiscal 2023, we will continue to manage and evaluate our logistics providers, but believe overall freight costs associated with imports will not return to pre-COVID-19 levels in the near-term due to continued inflationary pressures and heighted demand for shipping capacity.
 
Marketing
 
Celebrating 90 years of innovation, Ethan Allen’s marketing emphasizes our core brand values of quality and craftsmanship, combining personal service with technology, and a commitment to social responsibility. We amplify those values through our dynamic brand story told under the lifestyle of classics with a modern prospective. By adopting a fresh, ever-evolving creative approach, increasingly driven by digital strategies, we continue to broaden our reach and enhance desirability and visibility. Our combination of creative and analytics-driven strategies enables us to drive both new and repeat client traffic, to our design centers worldwide and to our website at ethanallen.com. Using our fully integrated customer relationship management system, we create personalized customer journeys, targeted communications, and retargeting campaigns. Our creative messaging is relevant and aspirational and conveyed through a variety of media, including digital marketing that includes social media and email marketing campaigns, direct mail, and local TV. Additionally, grassroots marketing is a critical initiative that is driven by our local design center teams. Taken together, these strategies help ensure that we are continuing to add to our client base while maintaining our existing relationships.

Once clients reach any point of purchase, we offer enticing financing options through the Ethan Allen Platinum Card, a third party-administered consumer credit program. Designed to make Ethan Allen accessible to everyone, the card continues to attract both new and recurring clients, driven by our strong financing programs, which has helped increase both conversion rates and average order size per transaction.
 
E-Commerce
 
We consider our website an extension of our retail design centers and not a separate segment of our business. Most clients will use the internet for inspiration and as a start to their shopping process to view products and prices. With so much of our product customizable, we encourage our website customers to get personal help from our interior design professionals either in person or by chatting online. We believe this complimentary direct contact with one of our interior design professionals, whether remotely or in-person, creates a competitive advantage through our excellent personal service. This enhances the online experience and regularly leads to internet customers becoming customers of our network of interior design centers.
 
Most recently, in June 2022, we debuted a state-of-the-art immersive Virtual Design Center, which showcases the timeless aesthetic of Ethan Allen’s vast product portfolio while fostering collaboration between our interior designers and their customers. The thousands of styles in our new Virtual Design Center strongly project classic design with a modern perspective, and the experience extends our commitment to combining personal interior design service with technology. Clients can access our home furnishings while either co-browsing live with an Ethan Allen designer or browsing on their own, at their own pace. Clients can view items in 3D, read product details, share, and save item lists, and utilize augmented reality views in their homes, either via a QR code on their desktop or directly when browsing on a mobile device. In addition, improved on-site search capabilities, expanded live chat services, online appointment booking capability, and product listing and display page enhancements continue to elevate the user experience. 
 
Our website traffic significantly increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic as people spent more time in their homes. However, as fiscal 2022 progressed, we saw a shift in traffic, from our website to in-person at the design center. Our total e-commerce net sales remained less than 5% of our total consolidated net sales in all periods presented.
 
We plan to further invest in our digital footprint, including expanding the Virtual Design Center, in order to enhance our customer experience. We are also regularly improving our customers’ journey from the time they land on our Ethan Allen website to the delivery of their purchase through our white glove home delivery service. Our marketing teams remain focused on enhancing our digital outreach strategies to further increase traffic and keep our brand relevant. 
 
The Client Experience
 
We have enhanced the client experience both in our design centers, as well as online by investing in digital design technologies over the past several years. EA inHome®, our augmented reality mobile app, empowers clients to preview Ethan Allen products in their homes, at scale, in a variety of fabrics and finishes. With the 3D Room Planner, our clients and designers generate both 2D floor plans and immersive, incredibly realistic 3D walk-throughs of the designs they create.  As previously discussed, the Virtual Design Center enables clients to shop within a virtual Ethan Allen showroom, receive detailed product information, and collaborate with an Ethan Allen designer within the virtual showroom. These technologies have been and will continue to be pivotal to our ability to offer clients a variety of touchpoints for design conversations; clients can easily work with designers in our design centers, at their homes, or online.
Segments
 
We have strategically aligned our business into two reportable segments: wholesale and retail. Our operating segments are aligned with how the Company, including our chief executive officer (defined as our chief operating decision maker), manages the business. These two segments represent strategic business areas of our vertically integrated enterprise that operate separately and provide their own distinctive services. This vertical structure enables us to offer our complete line of home furnishings and accents while better controlling quality and cost. We evaluate performance of the respective segments based upon net sales and operating income. Intersegment transactions result, primarily, from the wholesale sale of inventory to the retail segment, including the related profit margin. Financial information, including sales, operating income and long-lived assets related to our segments are disclosed in Note 19, Segment Information, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Our wholesale segment’s net sales include sales to our retail segment, which are eliminated in consolidation, and sales to external customers (our independent retailers and other unaffiliated third parties). Our retail segment net sales accounted for 84.4% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022. Our wholesale segment net sales accounted for the remaining 15.6%.

The following charts depict net sales related to our two reportable segments.
 

Retail Segment
 
The retail segment, which accounted for 84.4% of net sales during fiscal 2022, sells home furnishings and accents to clients through a network of 141 Company-operated design centers. Ethan Allen design centers are typically located in busy retail settings as freestanding destinations or as part of town centers, lifestyle centers, and suburban shopping malls, and average approximately 14,500 square feet in size with 58% of them ranging between 10,000 and 20,000 square feet, 28% being less than 10,000 square feet and the remaining 14% being greater than 20,000 square feet. Over the past 10 years, 48% of our design centers are new or have been relocated as we continually evaluate our retail footprint. Other initiatives include regularly updating presentations and floor plans, strengthening the qualifications of our designers through training and certifications and combining technology with personal service in our design centers, which has also allowed us to reduce the size of our design centers. In the past five years, we have either opened or relocated a total of 18 new design centers with an average size of 8,900 square feet. These smaller footprint design centers reflect our shift from destination and shopping mall locations to lifestyle centers that better project our brand and offer increased traffic opportunities.
 
Our objective is to continue to develop and strengthen our retail network by expanding the Company-operated retail business through the repositioning and opening of new design centers, obtaining new and retaining independent retailers, encouraging such retailers to expand their business through the opening or relocation of new design centers with the objective of increasing the volume of their sales and further expanding our sales network through our independent design associates and realtor referral programs.
 
Retail segment revenue is generated upon the sale and delivery of our products to our retail customers through our network of home delivery centers. Retail profitability reflects (i) the retail gross margin, which represents the difference between the retail net sales price and the cost of goods, purchased from the wholesale segment, and (ii) other operating costs associated with retail segment activities. We measure the performance of our design centers primarily based on net sales and operating income on a comparable period basis. The frequency of our promotional events as well as the timing of the end of those events can affect the comparability of net sales during a given period. Due to the nature of the business in which the retail segment operates, there are no customer concentration risks.
 
The retail segment’s product line revenue, expressed as a percentage of net sales during fiscal 2022, is comprised of approximately 53% in upholstered products, 27% case goods and the remaining 20% in home accents and other. In the last 12 months, we have seen a slight customer shift towards more upholstered products as the fiscal 2021 mix was 51% upholstered products, 28% case goods and 21% in home accents and other.
 
During fiscal 2022, we opened two new design centers (Westport, CT and Walnut Creek, CA), including one which was a relocation, and closed one design center. The geographic distribution of our retail design center locations is disclosed under Item 2, Properties, contained in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Wholesale Segment
 
The wholesale segment, which accounted for 15.6% of net sales during fiscal 2022, is principally involved in the development of the Ethan Allen brand and encompasses all aspects of design, manufacturing, sourcing, marketing, sale and distribution of our broad range of home furnishings and accents. Wholesale revenue is generated upon the sale and shipment of our products to our retail network of independently operated design centers, Company-operated design centers, and other third-party contract business customers. Our ten largest customers were all within our wholesale segment and accounted for 18% of sales within our wholesale segment during fiscal 2022 and 22% of sales during fiscal 2021. These customers were the United States government General Services Administration (“GSA”) and nine independent retailers. No single customer represented more than 5% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022.

Within the wholesale segment, we record revenue information according to each respective product line (i.e. case goods, upholstery and home accents). Case goods include items such as beds, dressers, armoires, tables, chairs, buffets, entertainment units, home office furniture and wooden accents. Upholstery items include sleepers, recliners and other motion furniture, chairs, ottomans, custom pillows, sofas, loveseats, cut fabrics and leather. Skilled artisans cut, sew and upholster custom-designed upholstery items which are available in a variety of frame, fabric and trim options. Home accent items include window treatments and drapery hardware, wall décor, florals, lighting, clocks, mattresses, bedspreads, throws, pillows, decorative accents, area rugs, wall coverings and home and garden furnishings.
 
Wholesale profitability includes (i) the wholesale gross margin, which represents the difference between the wholesale net sales price and the cost associated with manufacturing and/or sourcing the related product, and (ii) other operating costs associated with wholesale segment activities. The wholesale segment’s product line revenue, expressed as a percentage of net sales, is comprised of approximately 54% in upholstered products, 30% case goods and the remaining 16% in home accents and other. In the last 12 months, we have seen more wholesale sales of home accents primarily from increased imported product flow due to improvements in shipping container availability and improving lead times combined with growth within our contract business.
 
Our independent retailers are required to enter into license agreements with us, which authorize the use of certain Ethan Allen trademarks and require adherence to certain standards of operation, including a requirement to fulfill related warranty service agreements. We are not subject to any territorial or exclusive retailer agreements in North America.
 
The geographic distribution of manufacturing and distribution locations is disclosed under Item 2, Properties, contained in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Seasonality
 
We believe that the demand for home furnishings generally reflects sensitivity to overall economic conditions, including consumer confidence, discretionary spending, housing starts, sales of new and existing homes, housing values, the level of mortgage refinancing, debt levels, retail trends and unemployment rates. In a typical year, we schedule production to maintain consistent manufacturing activity throughout the year whenever possible. We typically shut down our domestic plants for one week at the beginning of each fiscal year to perform routine maintenance. For both our segments, historically, including in fiscal year 2022, no one particular fiscal quarter contributes more than 27% of annual sales volume, thus limiting our exposure to seasonality.
 
During the last two fiscal years, our sales volume and production schedules did not follow the aforementioned typical trends due to the impact of COVID-19. Since our retail locations and manufacturing facilities reopened by the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we have experienced heightened demand and in response, we took several actions to increase our production capacity throughout the last two fiscal years. As a result of these actions, our segments both experienced their largest fiscal 2022 sales volume during the fourth quarter. Further, due to our high backlog as of the end of fiscal 2022, we also do not anticipate typical sales trends during fiscal 2023. We do not expect that this impact is reflective of any long-term seasonal trends in the furniture industry or is an indicator that our trends are permanently changing.
 
For further discussion on the impact of COVID-19, refer to the Impact of COVID-19 on our Business section further above.
 
Backlog
 
We define backlog as any written order received that has not yet been delivered. Our wholesale backlog consists of written orders received from our retail network of independently operated design centers, Company-operated design centers, and contract business customers that have not yet been delivered. Our retail backlog is undelivered written orders associated with end retail customers. Stock replenishment orders not associated with a specific end customer are excluded from backlog. Our backlog fluctuates based on the timing of net orders booked, manufacturing production, the timing of imported product receipts, the timing and volume of shipments, and the timing of various promotional events. Historically, the size of our backlog at a given time varies and may not be indicative of our future sales, and therefore, we do not rely entirely on backlogs to predict future sales.
 
Increased manufacturing productivity and related shipments of products combined with the pace of written orders slowing led to improved delivery times and a reduction in wholesale backlog during fiscal 2022. Our wholesale backlog was $102.4 million as of June 30, 2022, down 14.7% from a year ago, but up 120.8% from June 30, 2019. The order backlog growth over 2019 was primarily due to demand significantly outpacing production along with pricing actions taken to mitigate the impact of rising raw material and freight costs. In the near-term, we remain focused on managing the business to work through our higher backlog and to service our customers.

Distribution and Logistics
 
We distribute our products through three national distribution centers, owned by the Company, strategically located in North Carolina and Virginia. These distribution centers provide efficient cross-dock operations to receive and ship product from our manufacturing facilities and third-party suppliers to our retail network of Company and independently operated retail home delivery centers. Retail home delivery centers prepare products for delivery into customers’ homes. At June 30, 2022, our Company-operated retail design centers were supported by 17 Company-operated retail home delivery centers and 10 home delivery centers operated by third parties.
 
The majority of our products are manufactured on a custom made-to-order basis. We also stock certain case goods, upholstery and home accents to provide for quick delivery of in-stock items and to allow for more efficient production runs. We utilize independent carriers to ship our products.
 
Our practice has been to sell our products at the same delivered cost to all Company and independently operated design centers throughout the United States, regardless of their shipping point. This policy creates pricing credibility with our wholesale customers while providing our retail segment the opportunity to achieve more consistent margins by removing fluctuations attributable to the cost of shipping. Further, this policy eliminates the need for our independent retailers to carry significant amounts of inventory in their own warehouses. As a result, we obtain more accurate consumer product demand information.
 
Human Capital Management
 
At June 30, 2022, our employee count totaled 4,239, with 3,039 employees in our wholesale segment and 1,200 in our retail segment. Our employee count grew 1.2% compared to June 30, 2021, with 48 net new employees in retail and 3 net new employees in our wholesale segment. The majority of our employees are employed on a full-time basis and we believe we maintain good relationships with our employees. None of our employees are represented by unions or collective bargaining agreements and we have not experienced any work stoppages. In managing our business, we focus on a number of key human capital measures and objectives, which are rooted in our core values and include the following items:
Culture and Values
 
Since our founding, we have aimed to build a collaborative culture that emphasizes treating people with dignity and respect while offering employees a variety of opportunities and experiences. As we celebrate 90 years of innovation, we believe the name “Ethan Allen” is well-known and highly regarded in the home furnishings marketplace. Our employees are vital to our success and are one of the main reasons we continue to execute at a high level. We believe our employees have an entrepreneurial spirit, a passion for style, a drive for excellence, outstanding communication skills and create a culture that embraces creativity, integrity, diversity, innovation and inclusion of people from all backgrounds. Our continued focus on making employee engagement a top priority will help us provide high quality products and services to our customers.
Diversity and Inclusion
 
Diversity and inclusion are two of our core values, as we recognize that our employees’ unique backgrounds, experiences and perspectives enable us to create and deliver the best-quality product and provide outstanding service to meet the needs of our customer base. We believe in creating and fostering a workplace in which all our employees feel valued, included and empowered to do their best work and contribute their ideas and perspectives. We are committed to recruiting and retaining diverse talent so that our workforce better reflects the communities in which we live and work. Our diversity and inclusion initiatives include developing impactful practices to advance our Company’s diversity and inclusion, supporting diversity awareness across our organization, maintaining an inclusive environment free from discrimination of any kind, including sexual or other discriminatory harassment, and continuing to offer our employees multiple avenues through which to report inappropriate behavior, including our confidential whistleblower hotline.
 
At Ethan Allen, we work every day to capitalize on the talents of women, promoting them to leadership positions in both our retail network and in our corporate management. Approximately 72% of management in our retail network and 25% of manufacturing and distribution leadership are women. At our Corporate headquarters, 47% of leadership are women.

Health and Safety
 
Ethan Allen is committed to protecting the health and safety of our employees. We care about our employee, customers, and the communities we serve. We have a strong safety program that focuses on implementing policies and training programs to ensure our employees can leave their job and return home safely, every day. This commitment and focus have enabled us to restart our business operations without sacrificing the safety of our employees and customers. During fiscal 2022 and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adhered to local and federal health guidelines to implement our return-to-office and employee safety protocols.
 
In addition to our COVID-19 protections, which are discussed within the Impact of COVID-19 on our Business section further above, we have partnered with local communities in some of our North American manufacturing workshops to provide transportation to and from work and offer daily low-cost meals. In coordination with national healthcare systems for our manufacturing facilities outside of the United States, we provide on-site medical clinics staffed by a doctor and a team of experienced nurses, who also provide a pharmacy to prescribe over-the-counter medications. In addition to offering onsite medical care, we partner with local physicians to provide medical care for every associate’s family members.
 
Community Giving
 
Throughout our history, philanthropy has been a core value to Ethan Allen. We strive to develop exceptional programs based on partnerships where employees feel a sense of connection and pride in their communities and our mission is to enhance the quality of life in the communities in which we work and live. During fiscal 2022, we hosted multiple on-site clinics at our manufacturing plants located in Mexico and Honduras to keep our communities safe and these programs were critical in providing vaccine access. These types of actions helped Ethan Allen’s upholstery workshop in Mexico be named “Empresa Socialmente Responsible” (meaning “Socially Responsible Company,” which is based on norms of conduct on social and environmental issues) by the Mexican Center for Corporate Philanthropy and the Alliance for Corporate Social Responsibility. These organizations recognize corporate policies that promote a positive social impact in Mexico and Latin America.
Compensation and Other Benefits
 
Our compensation programs are designed to attract, retain, and motivate team members to achieve strong results. We benchmark our compensation practices and benefits programs against those of comparable industries and in the geographic areas where our facilities are located. We believe that our compensation and employee benefits are competitive and allow us to attract and retain skilled labor throughout our enterprise. Certain of the benefits we offer include access to healthcare plans, financial and physical wellness programs, paid time off, parental leave and retirement benefits, including a 401(k) plan with Company matching contributions.
Customer Financing Program
 
The Ethan Allen Platinum Card consumer credit program offers clients a menu of custom financing options. Financing offered through this program is administered by a third-party financial institution and is granted to our clients on a non-recourse basis to the Company. Clients may apply for an Ethan Allen Platinum Card at any participating design center or online at ethanallen.com. During fiscal 2022, we offered no-interest financing, which helped generate additional demand for our products. As we head into fiscal 2023, we will continue to evaluate the use of interest-free financing options and their related costs, given the recent rise in interest rates.
Competition
 
The home furnishings industry is a highly fragmented and competitive business. There has been growth from internet only retailers and those with a brick-and-mortar presence. We believe the home furnishings industry competes primarily on the basis of product styling and quality, personal service, prompt delivery, product availability and price. We compete with numerous individual retail home furnishing stores as well as national and regional chains. We further believe that we are well-positioned to compete on the basis of each of these factors and that, more specifically under our vertical integration structure, our complimentary interior design service, direct manufacturing, a logistics network including white glove delivery service and relevant product offerings create a competitive advantage, further supporting our mission of providing customers with a complete home decorating and design solution. We also believe that we differentiate ourselves further with the quality of our interior design service through our extensive training programs and the caliber of our interior design professionals.

Environmental Sustainability and Social Responsibility 
 
We continue to be focused on environmental and social responsibility while incorporating uniform social, environmental, health and safety programs into our global manufacturing standards.
 
Our environmental (green) initiatives include, but are not limited to the use of responsibly harvested Appalachian woods, and water-based finishes and measuring our carbon footprint, greenhouse gases and recycled materials from our operations. We have eliminated the use of heavy metals and hydrochlorofluorocarbons in all packaging. Our mattresses and custom upholstery use foam made without harmful chemicals and substances. We have implemented the Enhancing Furniture’s Environmental Culture (“EFEC”) environmental management system sponsored by the American Home Furnishing Alliance (“AHFA”) at all our domestic manufacturing, distribution and home delivery center facilities, and have expanded these efforts to our retail design centers, which have now been registered in EFEC. Our Mexico and Honduras facilities are also registered under the AHFA's EFEC program. Our United States manufacturing, distribution and home delivery centers have also achieved Sustainable by Design (“SBD”) registration status under the EFEC program. SBD provides a framework for home furnishings companies to create and maintain a corporate culture of conservation and environmental stewardship by integrating socio-economic policies and sustainable business practices into their manufacturing operations and sourcing strategies.
 
Our manufacturing operations involve the use and disposal of certain substances regulated under environmental protection laws and, from time to time, we may be involved in a small number of remediation actions and site investigations concerning these substances. Based on a review of all currently known facts and our experience with previous environmental matters, we currently do not believe it is probable that we will have any additional loss for environmental matters that would be material to our consolidated financial statements.
 
The Company requires its sourcing facilities that manufacture Ethan Allen branded products to implement a labor compliance program and meet or exceed the standards established for preventing child labor, involuntary labor, coercion and harassment, discrimination, and restrictions to freedom of association. These facilities are also required to provide a safe and healthy environment in all workspaces, compliance with all local wage and hour laws and regulations, compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and are required to authorize Ethan Allen or its designated agents (including third-party auditing companies) to engage in monitoring activities to confirm compliance. We work to ensure our products are safe in our customers’ homes through responsible use of chemicals and manufacturing substances.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We currently hold, or have registration applications pending for, trademarks, service marks and copyrights for the Ethan Allen name, logos and designs in a broad range of classes for both products and services in the United States and in many foreign countries. In addition, we have registered, or have applications pending for certain of our slogans utilized in connection with promoting brand awareness, retail sales and other services and certain collection names. In addition, we have registered and maintain the internet domain name of ethanallen.com. We view such trademarks, logos, service marks and domain names as valuable assets and have an ongoing program to diligently monitor and defend, through appropriate action, against their unauthorized use. In connection with our on-going maintenance of our intellectual property. The Company routinely reviews the necessity for renewal as registrations expire.
Government Regulation
 
The Company is subject to reporting requirements, disclosure obligations and other recordkeeping requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the various local authorities that regulate each location in which we operate. 
Corporate Contact Information
 
Ethan Allen’s principal executive office is in Danbury, Connecticut.
