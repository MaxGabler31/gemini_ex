Company
 
Overview
 
We were incorporated on September 25, 2013 in the State of Nevada. We have never been involved in any reclassification, merger, consolidation or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets nor have we ever declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or been involved in any legal action or proceedings.
 

The business
 
Pacman Media is a new venture, which aims to specialize in the creation of mobile apps (applications) to be used on smartphones, tablet computers and any other mobile devise. We are likely to face potential challenges, risks and uncertainties, such as situations stated in our section titled Risk Factors, this situations could have adverse material effect on our company therefore negative outcome for our investors.
 Apps are a relatively new phenomenon, first made available to customers in a meaningful way with the launch of the Apple App Store in 2008.
 
Our believe is that frequently, a mobile app is simply a stripped-down version of a desktop computer program, able to fulfill the basic functions but missing the more advanced features. At other times a mobile app, like Skype for example, fulfills pretty much all the same functions as the version on your laptop.
 
We think that the market is seeing a category of app that is specifically designed for use on a smartphone; taking into account a phones limitations  keyboard typing but exploiting its strengths  mobility. This too will be the focus of Pacman Media  the creation of apps specifically designed for iPhone users to the extent that the app may be almost pointless on a desktop computer.
 Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion, which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.  
 
Our apps

Pacman Media intends to specialize in voice activated apps and we have three distinct voice activated concepts that we plan to design and launch. We believe that voice recognition technology is an exciting area, still could be in its infancy but maybe with boundless potential and opportunity. We believe this area best fulfills our strategy of designing apps with phone users in mind and these apps will also be useful for iPad or tablet users because, like phones, these devises are relatively mobile, meaning one could use them when out and about.
 
After research Pacman Media have set sights on Dragon dictation software as we decided it is the best technology on the market to power our apps and ensure that they work.
We aim to have apps that are voice activated, meaning that they respond to audio commands. Specifically we intend to exploit the transcription functions of Dragon dictation to streamline the implementation of common tasks in the film and television industries. During the preparation of a film, typically known as pre-production, crew members from all departments of the production, take notes when viewing a potential filming location for example. Many take notes by speaking into a dictaphone, which they then have to transcribe at a later point in order to review their notes. Our apps intend to save customer this trouble and therefore save him or her time and energy, basically streamline this process.At Pacman Media we plan to hire a team who have backgrounds in the film and television creative industries and so appreciate and understand how our apps will be extremely useful to fellow media professionals.
 
Creating the apps
 
Developing apps with commercial intent using Dragon software will require purchasing the Dragon license, which costs $10,000.00. This is a one off payment after which Pacman Media will be free to exploit Dragon dictation software for all commercial purposes until the end of time.
 Pacman Media will also require the services of a software development team. After careful research we have settled on The Future who we believe have a track record developing voice apps. Their development fee on our three showcase apps will range from $9000 - $15,000 depending on the project.
 
Launching the apps
 
Once an app is finished and ready to go to market it will be launched via the Apple App Store, which gives us access to a iPhone and iPad users worldwide, from the United States to United Kingdom to Japan, China to Europe. 30 percent of revenue from the store goes to Apple, and 70 percent goes to the producer of the app (minus an annual USD$99.00 development fee to Apple).
 Pacman Media also planning to launch a promotional campaign to raise awareness of the unique features of each app. This may be done using celebrated artists, or industry professionals, where appropriate and all aspects of social media. In addition Pacman Media will try to lobby trade publications that specialize in reviewing new apps and technology, with a view to receiving positive coverage and greater exposure.

We plan to operate and sell our apps in English speaking countries, primarily the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. If our launch in these territories is successful we will consider a second launch in non-English speaking territories, which will involve translating and rebuilding the apps in Russian, Japanese or Chinese for example. In this scenario we would also have to examine the best platform for selling our apps, which may not involve the Apple Store who have run into repeated difficulties regarding their business operations in China. Lunching our apps in bureaucratically strenuous country like Russia can bring additional challenges such as working out specific government regulations, potential political and economic instability, language barrier and similar issues and risks typical for a very foreign market.

Many apps are free. Companies may pursue this strategy to showcase their products in the hope of securing future investment. Apps that charge for downloading range anywhere from under $1 to over $100. Typically an app will be in the $5 - $8 region.
 We think that unlike mass use apps like Angry Birds Pacman Media apps will be specialized and catered towards industry professionals, specifically professionals in the film and television creative industries as well as those aspiring to join their ranks such as film and media students. As such our apps will be in the region of $10.
 
Related business
 In promoting our apps we will be harnessing the power of social media and this is something we might be good at. As such we will also seek opportunities to provide our social media services and skills for others at a fee. We think that social media has become an ever growing and ever crucial component of advertising and Pacman Media will be utilizing twitter, facebook and youtube to promote our app. Despite its relative low cost, an effective social media campaign still requires specialized skill and strategy to run successfully. Our President David Evans has experience in this area and once we are able to demonstrate the successful launch of Pacman Media by harnessing the power of social media we might be able to raise revenue by offering these skills out to other companies and brands for a fee. Specifically we are talking about running a twitter feed, with constant updates relating to the linear progression of a brands release to the public and a facebook page where we will aggressively pursue likes, friends and lengthier updates. In addition we are considering running a youtube channel that will provide a platform to release promotional videos.
 Major Risk
 The market is saturated with mobile apps. We researched the data available, which shows most recent statistic only as of June 2014, there were more than 1,200,000 apps available for download from the Apple Store, this is according to the website that the we came across called Tech Crunch, found at the following web link: http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/02/itunes-app-store-now-has-1-2-million-apps-has-seen-75-billion-downloads-to-date/. This may mean that the market is saturated and the difficulty to stand out from the crowd is present.An additional risk is that one can launch an app that has some success but then it is copied by bigger companies with more resources or an established presence on the market and improved upon leading to loss of market share. This seems to be a common occurrence with several similar type apps launched within months of each other and becoming fierce competitors.However, taken from our further research on the various unrelated to our company Internet websites, for comparison there were 900,000 available for download in June 2013.In July 2009 there were .01 billion apps downloaded.By October 2014 this had risen to 85 billion apps downloaded from the Apple Store (cumulative). The trick is to stand out from the crowd, facilitating a groundswell of support that goes viral.
