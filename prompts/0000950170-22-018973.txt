 Item 1. Business
 Business Overview
 One of the original off-price retailers, Tuesday Morning is a leading destination for unique home and lifestyle goods. We were established in 1974 and specialize in name-brand, better/best products for the home. We are known for irresistible finds at an incredible value, and we search the world for amazing deals to bring to our customers.
 We are an off-price retailer, selling high-quality products at prices generally below those found in boutique, specialty and department stores, catalogs and on-line retailers. Our customers come to us for an ever-changing, exceptional assortment of brand names at great prices. Our primary merchandise categories are upscale home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, gourmet food, pet supplies, bath and body products, toys and seasonal décor. We buy our inventory opportunistically from a variety of sources including direct from manufacturer, through closeout sellers and occasionally other retailers. We have strong supplier relationships, and we strive to make it easy for our vendors to do business with us, so that they will come to us first. Our goods are deeply discounted, but never seconds or irregulars.
 Our customer is a savvy shopper with a discerning taste for quality at a value. Our strong value proposition has established a loyal customer base, who we engage regularly with social media, email, and digital media.
With 489 stores across the country as of July 2, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”), we are in the neighborhood in convenient, accessible locations. Our store layout is clean and simple, and the low-frills environment means we can pass even deeper savings on to our dedicated customer base. Our stores operate in both primary and secondary locations of major suburban markets, near our middle and upper‑income customers. We are generally able to obtain favorable lease terms due to our flexibility regarding site selection and our straightforward format, allowing us to use a wide variety of space configurations.
 On February 23, 2022, the board of directors of the Company approved a change in the fiscal year end from a calendar year ending on June 30 to a 52-53-week year ending on the Saturday closest to June 30, effective beginning with fiscal year 2022. In a 52-week fiscal year, each of the Company’s quarterly periods will comprise 13 weeks. The additional week in a 53-week fiscal year is added to the fourth quarter, making such quarter consist of 14 weeks. The Company made the fiscal year change on a prospective basis and will not adjust operating results for prior periods.
 We have one operating segment and one reportable segment as our chief operating decision maker, the Executive Committee composed of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Finance Officer, and other senior executives, reviews financial information on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.
 Updates on COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on our business operations, store traffic, employee availability, financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity and cash flow. On March 25, 2020, we temporarily closed all of our stores nationwide, severely reducing revenues, resulting in significant operating losses and the elimination of substantially all operating cash flow. As allowed by state and local jurisdictions, our stores gradually reopened as of the end of June 2020. In accordance with our bankruptcy plan of reorganization, described below, we completed the permanent closure of 197 stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and the closure of our Phoenix, Arizona distribution center (“Phoenix distribution center”) in second quarter of fiscal 2021. In addition, as part of our restructuring, we secured financing to pay creditors in accordance with the plan of reorganization and to fund planned operations and expenditures.
   The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments, including future surges in incidences of COVID-19 and the severity of any such resurgence, the rate and efficacy of vaccinations against COVID-19, the length of time that impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic continue, how fast economies will fully recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and extent of any further impacts on traffic and consumer spending in our stores, the extent and duration of ongoing impacts to domestic and international supply chains and the related impacts on the flow, and availability and cost of products.
Emergence from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Proceedings
 •In response to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, on May 27, 2020, we filed voluntary petitions (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”). During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, we continued to operate our businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court.
 •On December 31, 2020, we legally emerged from bankruptcy following Bankruptcy Court approval and resolution of all material conditions precedent listed in our plan of reorganization (the “Plan of Reorganization”). However, the closing of 


an equity financing transaction was considered a critical component to the execution of our confirmed Plan of Reorganization, therefore, we continued to apply the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC') 852 – Reorganizations until that transaction closed on February 9, 2021. In connection with our legal emergence from bankruptcy on December 31, 2020, the Company completed certain debt financings (including an asset-based revolving credit facility and a term loan) and sale-leaseback transactions of our corporate office and Dallas distribution center properties contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization. See Notes 1, 2, 3 and 8 of our consolidated financial statements for further discussions on these matters.

Refinancing Transactions
 •Since the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy in December 2020, the Company’s results of operations have been negatively impacted by a variety of factors, including pandemic-related disruptions to supply chains and higher supply chain costs resulting from higher freight costs and other supply chain conditions, reduced store traffic and sales as a result of decades high inflation including increased fuel prices. In order to bolster the Company’s liquidity, on May 9, 2022 , the Company, Tuesday Morning, Inc. (the “Borrower”) and each other subsidiary of the Company (together with the Company and the Borrower, the "Company Credit Parties") entered into a Credit Agreement (the “New ABL Credit Agreement”) with the lenders named therein (the “ABL Lenders”), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and 1903P Loan Agent, LLC, as FILO B documentation agent. The New ABL Credit Agreement replaced the asset-based revolving credit facility the Company entered into upon its emergence from bankruptcy. The New ABL Credit Agreement provides for (i) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of $110.0 million (the “New ABL Facility”), which includes a $10.0 million sublimit for swingline loans and a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit, (ii) a first-in last-out term loan facility in an aggregate amount of $5.0 million (the “FILO A Facility”) and (iii) an additional first-in last-out term loan facility in an aggregate amount of $5.0 million (the “FILO B Facility” and, collectively with the New ABL Facility and the FILO A Facility, the “New Facilities”). In addition, under the original terms of the New ABL Credit Agreement, the Borrower had the right, on and following November 9, 2022 (the “FILO B Delayed Incremental Loan”), to request (x) an additional incremental loan under the FILO B Facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed $5.0 million, and (y) additional incremental commitments from the FILO B lenders to make additional loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $5.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
 •On May 9, 2022, the Company, the Borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Company, certain of the term loan lenders (the “Consenting Lenders”), and Alter Domus (US) LLC, as administrative agent, entered into an amendment (the “May 2022 Term Loan Amendment”) to the Term Loan Credit Agreement dated as of December 31, 2020 (as amended, the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”). Pursuant to the May 2022 Term Loan Amendment, among other things, (1) the Company agreed, among things, to repurchase a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the outstanding indebtedness (the “Term Loan”) under the Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Loan Repurchase”) and concurrently with the consummation of the Loan Repurchase, each Consenting Lender agreed to waive and forgive an amount of the accrued and unpaid interest owed to such Consenting Lender, and (2) the Term Loan Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, (a) provide that the Borrower and its subsidiaries shall not permit the borrowing availability under the New ABL Facility to be less than the greater of (A) $7.5 million and (B) 7.5% of the Modified Revolving Loan Cap (as defined in the New ABL Credit Agreement), and (b) require the Company's compliance with a total secured net leverage ratio commencing with the 12-month period ending September 30, 2023.
 •Subsequent to May 2022, the Company experienced further significant deterioration in its financial condition and liquidity. On the July 11, 2022, the Company Credit Parties, certain lenders, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and 1903P Loan Agent, LLC, as FILO B documentation agent, entered into a first amendment (the “July 2022 ABL Amendment”) to the New ABL Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the July 2022 ABL Amendment, the lenders agreed to make the $5 million FILO B Delayed Incremental Loan to the Borrower on July 11, 2022. The July 2022 ABL Amendment also provided that, until certain minimum borrowing availability levels are satisfied as described in the ABL Amendment, the Borrower will be subject to additional reporting obligations, the Borrower will retain a third-party business consultant acceptable to the administrative agent, and the administrative agent may elect to apply amounts in controlled deposit accounts to the repayment of outstanding borrowings under the New ABL Facility. In addition, pursuant to the July 2022 ABL Amendment, certain subsidiaries of the Borrower agreed to enter into and maintain a supply agreement with Gordon Brothers Retail Partners, LLC (the “Program Agent”), an affiliate of a FILO B lender, pursuant to which the Program Agent supplies inventory to the Borrower and certain of its subsidiaries. In connection with the July 2022 ABL Amendment, the Term Loan Credit Agreement was further amended to make certain conforming changes.
 For additional information regarding the New ABL Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Credit Agreement, see Notes 3 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
 •Over the last three months, the Company also has engaged in an extensive process to obtain additional financing to support the Company’s capital needs. On September 20, 2022, the Company and its subsidiary Tuesday Morning, Inc. entered into 


an amended and restated note purchase agreement (as amended and restated on September 20, 2022, the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with certain members of management of the Company, TASCR Ventures, LLC (the “SPV”), a special purpose entity formed by Retail Ecommerce Ventures LLC ("REV") and Ayon Capital L.L.C., and TASCR Ventures CA, LLC, as collateral agent, which provided for financing transaction of $35 million (the “Private Placement”). On September 20, 2022, the Private Placement closed with the SPV purchasing (i) $7.5 million of junior secured convertible notes (the “FILO C Convertible Notes”), and (ii) $24.5 million in aggregate principal in aggregate principal amount of a junior secured convertible notes issued by the Company (the “SPV Convertible Notes”). In addition, members of the Company’s management team purchased $3.0 million in aggregate principal amount of junior secured convertible notes issued by the Company (the “Management Convertible Notes” and, together with the SPV Convertible Notes, the “Junior Convertible Notes”; the FILO C Convertible Notes and the Junior Convertible Notes are referred to herein together as the “Convertible Debt”).
 •The Convertible Debt is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial conversion price of $0.077 per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. A portion of the Convertible Debt issued to the SPV was immediately convertible for up to 90 million shares of the Company’s common stock. On September 21, 2022, the SPV elected to immediately convert a portion of the Convertible Debt into 90,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, and the SPV acquired a majority of the Company’s outstanding common stock. Upon conversion in full of the Convertible Debt and based on the Company's outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis as of September 21, 2022, the SPV would hold approximately 75%, and the purchasers of the Convertible Debt collectively would hold approximately 81%, of the total diluted voting power of the Company’s common stock (not including any additional Convertible Debt that may be issued as a result of the Company being required or electing to make in-kind payments of interest during the two-year period following closing of the Private Placement).
 •In accordance with the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, the SPV designated each of Tai Lopez, Alexander Mehr, Maya Burkenroad, Sandip Patel and James Harris (collectively, the “SPV Designees”) to serve as directors of the Company effective upon the closing of the Private Placement on September 20, 2022. In connection with the election the SPV Designees to the Company’s board of directors, each of Douglas J. Dossey, Frank M. Hamlin, W. Paul Jones, John Hartnett Lewis and Sherry M. Smith resigned from the Company’s board of directors. Each of the remaining incumbent directors Fred Hand, Anthony F. Crudele, Marcelo Podesta and Reuben E. Slone continued to serve on the board following the closing of the Private Placement. Each of Messrs. Crudele, Podesta and Slone are expected to resign from the Company’s board of directors following the filing of this Annual Report, and three additional independent directors will be elected to the board in accordance with the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement.
 •The Nasdaq Stock Market rules would normally require stockholder approval prior to closing the Private Placement; however, the Company requested and received a financial viability exception to the stockholder approval requirement pursuant to Nasdaq Stock Market Rule 5635(f). The financial viability exception allows an issuer to issue securities upon prior written application to The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) when the delay in securing stockholder approval of such issuance would seriously jeopardize the financial viability of the company. As required by Nasdaq rules, the Company’s Audit Committee, which is comprised solely of independent and disinterested directors, expressly approved reliance on the financial viability exception in connection with the Private Placement and related transactions.
 •In connection with the Private Placement, certain amendments were made to the New ABL Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Credit Agreement to permit the Private Placement.
 For additional information regarding the Private Placement, see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
 Business Strategy
 In fiscal 2022, we focused on resetting our merchandise strategy to our heritage of being an off-price retailer. We edited our assortment and drove our merchandising efforts to deliver our customers a treasure hunt and strong values that are representative of the off-price marketplace. Additionally, we worked to improve working capital management and inventory turns, and continued to optimize our marketing effectiveness, cost controls and infrastructure.
Competition & Seasonality
 We believe the principal factors by which we compete are value, brand names, breadth and quality of our product offerings. Our prices are generally below those of department and specialty stores, catalog and on‑line retailers and we offer a broad assortment of high‑end, first quality, brand-name merchandise. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including department, discount and specialty stores, e‑commerce and catalog retailers and mass merchants, which sell, among other products, home furnishings, housewares and related products. We also compete in particular markets with a substantial number of retailers that specialize in one or more types of home furnishing and houseware products that we sell. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources that may, among other things, increase their ability to purchase inventory at lower costs or to initiate and sustain aggressive price competition.


Our business is subject to seasonality, with a higher level of our net sales and operating income generated during the quarter ending December 31, which includes the holiday shopping season. Net sales in the quarters ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 accounted for approximately 34%, 29%, and 37% of our annual net sales for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The rate for fiscal 2022 is impacted by the change in calendar year as defined above.
Working Capital Items
 Because of the seasonal nature of our business, our working capital needs are greater in the months leading up to our peak sales period from Thanksgiving to the end of December. We expect to fund our operations with funds generated from operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. See Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information.
Inventory is one of the largest assets on our balance sheet. Efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet our customers’ demands while keeping the inventory fresh and turning the inventory appropriately to optimize profitability.
Purchasing
 We provide an outlet for manufacturers and other sources looking for effective ways to reduce excess inventory resulting from order cancellations by retailers, manufacturing overruns, bankruptcies, and excess capacity. Since our inception, we have not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining first quality, brand-name off‑price merchandise in adequate volumes and at competitive prices. We utilize a mix of both domestic and international suppliers. We generally pay our suppliers timely and generally do not request special consideration for markdowns, advertising or returns. During fiscal 2022, our top ten vendors accounted for approximately 14.5% of total purchases, with no single vendor accounting for more than 1.9% of total purchases. We continue to build strong vendor relationships following our emergence from Chapter 11 and have had no significant supplier issues as a result of the bankruptcy filing.
 Low-Cost Operations
 It is our goal to operate with a low-cost structure in comparison to many other retailers. We place great emphasis on expense management throughout the Company. Our stores have a “no frills” format and we are flexible in our site selection in order to maintain favorable lease terms.
 Customer Shopping Experience
 While we offer a “no frills” format in our stores, we have made progress in reorganizing and refreshing our stores to enhance our customers’ shopping experience. We offer a flexible return policy, and we accept all major payment methods including cash, checks, all major credit cards, gift cards and digital wallets. We continue to work on initiatives we believe will enhance our customers’ shopping experience.
Distribution Network
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we reached the decision to close our 0.6 million square foot distribution center in the Phoenix distribution center and consolidate operations in our Dallas-based facility, which was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. In June 2021, we leased an additional 100,000 square foot warehouse in Dallas, Texas (the “Stemmons DC Facility”) to supplement our distribution network. On April 15, 2022, the Company decided to terminate the lease early at the Stemmons DC Facility prior to the expiration of the lease on June 30, 2023. The facility was previously utilized with the network of pool point facilities and as pack and hold storage to service all of our stores throughout the United States.
 On December 1, 2021, the Company leased 156,205 square feet of space (the "FW Railhead Warehouse") to supplement our warehouse space for pack and hold storage.
Pricing
 Our pricing policy is to sell merchandise generally below retail prices charged by department and specialty stores, catalog and on‑line retailers. Prices are determined centrally and are initially uniform at all of our stores. Once a price is determined for a particular item, labels displaying two‑tiered pricing are affixed to the product. A typical price tag displays a “Compare At” or “Compare Estimated Value” price, and “Our Price”. Our buyers determine and verify retail “Compare At” or “Compare Estimated Value” prices by reviewing prices published in advertisements, catalogs, on‑line and manufacturers’ suggested retail price lists and by visiting department or specialty stores selling similar merchandise. Our information systems provide daily sales and inventory information, which enables us to evaluate our prices and inventory levels and to adjust prices on unsold merchandise in a timely manner and as dictated by sell-through percentages, thereby effectively managing our inventory levels and offering competitive pricing.
 Human Capital Management

As of July 2, 2022, we employed 1,601 persons on a full‑time basis and 4,445 persons on a part‑time basis. Our associates are not represented by any labor unions, and we have not experienced any work stoppage due to labor disagreements. We believe that our associate relationships are strong, in part, due to the following areas of commitment to a loyal and inclusive associate base:
Associate Engagement
We have an engagement committee of which the associate members are diverse from across the organization. The committee focuses on communication and events to bring our associates together such as ongoing associate events, associate appreciation week, community volunteer opportunities, and charitable events. Our engagement team surveys the associates they work with periodically to collect feedback, which we use to improve the experience of our teams. Our leadership and human resources department maintain an open-door policy for associates to report concerns, and we provide an anonymous reporting hotline, available in multiple languages. Also, we conduct quarterly business meetings so that associates can directly hear about the business from senior leaders. We strive to deliver a workplace experience where the quality of our engagement with fellow associates, business partners and customers aligns with our company values.
Talent Development
We utilize an online training and education platform for all associates to be compliant with federal, state, privacy and cybersecurity laws as applicable. We also invest in our store associates through structured training programs for our assistant store managers and store managers that enable our associates to be more effective leaders and helps them strive towards achieving the career they envision for themselves. All associates are given detailed feedback about their performance on at least an annual basis through formal performance appraisals. Based on the associate’s career goals, leaders may work to design individual development plans. Upon completion of performance appraisals this fiscal year, the company will engage in succession planning to identify and develop talent within the organization.
Core Values
 In an effort to ensure our company’s values accurately reflect our current business, we collaborated with internal focus groups to revitalize them. Our new values are foundational to our company operations and our interactions with each other and our customers:
 •Trust and respect each other
 •Focus on the customer, internal and external
 •Collaborate with each other – one team
 •Drive results while embracing change
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
Associate engagement and retention require an understanding of the needs of a diverse, creative, and purpose-driven workforce. We firmly believe that working in a culture focused on diversity, equity and inclusion spurs innovation, creates healthy and high-performing teams, and delivers superior customer experiences. We aim to provide equal opportunity for all employees. As of July 2, 2022, 74.7% of our total workforce identified as female and 44.0% were minorities. Additionally, 35.0% of our Vice-Presidents and above identified as female. We have a summer internship program at the corporate office that we look to expand to other areas of the business in the near future.
We remain focused on increasing the representation of minority talent through hiring and career development by striving to have our stores reflect the diversity in their communities. Our stores also offer a diverse range of products creating an inclusive shopping experience. Our passion for the deal extends to our commitment to providing our customers with a multicultural range of products at a variety of price points.
Safety/Health and Wellness
We are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for our associates and customers. Aligned with our values, we strive to continuously monitor our work environment to keep our associates and customers as safe as possible. We have an open-door policy for all associates to report concerns or safety issues. If an associate does not feel comfortable reporting an incident to their immediate manager or the human resources department, then the associate may contact the company’s ethics and compliance hotline via a toll-free number or access it via the web. The hotline is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Our commitment to associate safety also include ongoing safety communications with safety topics, safety training and audits for review.

During fiscal 2020, to address the safety and public health of our workforce and customers due to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a number of protocols that we continue to use today.
 We offer a hybrid work schedule to all of our eligible associates that are able to work from home effectively.
We continue to offer a vaccination incentive program including offering vaccines onsite at the corporate office and distribution center which we started during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Further, we have made available, at no cost to our associates, on site COVID testing at our distribution center and select stores based on CDC guidelines.
 Compensation and Benefits
 We offer a benefits package designed to put our associates’ health and well-being, and that of their families, at the forefront. Depending on position and location, associates may be eligible for: 401(k) plan and other investment opportunities; paid vacations, holidays, and other time-off programs; health, dental and vision insurance; health and dependent care tax-free spending accounts; medical, family and bereavement leave; paid maternity/primary caregiver benefits; tax-free commuter benefits; wellness programs; time off to volunteer, and matching donations to qualifying nonprofit organizations.

In fiscal 2023, we plan to open approximately one new store. We also plan to close approximately five stores.
 
Site Selection. We continue to evaluate our current store base for potential enhancement or relocation of our store locations. As a result of this ongoing evaluation, we intend to pursue attractive relocation opportunities in our existing store base, close certain stores by allowing leases to expire for underperforming stores or where alternative locations in similar trade areas are not available at acceptable lease rates, and, when appropriate, open new stores. For both new stores and relocations, we negotiate for upgraded sites. Additionally, we have reviewed all of our leases and renegotiated the terms, with favorable outcomes for many of our leases. We believe that this strategy will better position us for long‑term profitable growth.
 Store Leases. We conduct substantially all operations from leased facilities, including our corporate offices in Dallas and the Dallas warehouse, distribution and retail complex, which were leased on December 31, 2020, subsequent to the sale and leaseback of those facilities on that date. Our retail store locations, our corporate office and our distribution center are under operating leases that will expire over the next 1 to 10 years. Many of our leases include options to renew at our discretion. We include the lease renewal option periods in the calculation of our operating lease assets and liabilities when it is reasonably certain that we will renew the lease. We also lease certain equipment under finance leases that generally expire within 5 years.
Store Layout.  Our site selection process and “no frills” approach to presenting merchandise allow us to use a wide variety of space configurations. The size of our stores ranges from approximately 6,100 to 28,700 square feet, averaging on a per store basis approximately 12,700 square feet as of July 2, 2022. Historically, we have designed our stores to be functional, with less emphasis placed upon fixtures and leasehold aesthetics. With our current real estate strategy, we continue to be focused on designing a very functional, easy to shop environment that also highlights the quality of the merchandise. We display all merchandise on counters, shelves, or racks while maintaining minimum inventory in our stockrooms.
 Store Operations. Our stores are generally open seven days a week, excluding certain holidays. The timing and frequency of shipments of merchandise to our stores results in efficiency of receiving and restocking activities at our stores. We attempt to align our part‑time employees’ labor hours with anticipated workload and with current sales. We conduct annual physical counts of our store merchandise staggered throughout the second half of our fiscal year, primarily when stores are closed.
 Store Management. Each store has a manager who is responsible for recruiting, training and supervising store personnel and assuring that the store is managed in accordance with our established guidelines and procedures. Store managers are full‑time employees. Our store managers are supported by district and regional level support. Store managers are responsible for centrally directed store disciplines and routines. The store manager is assisted primarily by part‑time employees who generally serve as assistant managers and cashiers, and help with merchandise stocking efforts. Members of our management visit selected stores routinely to review inventory levels and merchandise presentation, personnel performance, expense controls, security and adherence to our policies and procedures. In addition, district and regional field managers periodically meet with senior management to review store policies and discuss purchasing, merchandising, advertising and other operational issues.
