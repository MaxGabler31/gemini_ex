ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Axogen is the leading company focused specifically on the science, development, and commercialization of technologies for peripheral nerve regeneration and repair. We are passionate about providing the opportunity to restore nerve function and quality of life for patients with peripheral nerve injuries. We provide innovative, clinically proven, and economically effective repair solutions for surgeons and healthcare providers. Peripheral nerves provide the pathways for both motor and sensory signals throughout the body. Every day, people suffer traumatic injuries or undergo surgical procedures that impact the function of their peripheral nerves. Physical damage to a peripheral nerve or the inability to properly reconnect peripheral nerves can result in the loss of muscle or organ function, the loss of sensory feeling, or the initiation of pain.
Axogen’s platform for peripheral nerve repair features a comprehensive portfolio of products, including:
•Avance® Nerve Graft, a biologically active off-the-shelf processed human nerve allograft for bridging severed peripheral nerves without the comorbidities associated with a second surgical site; 
•Axoguard Nerve Connector®, a porcine (pig) submucosa extracellular matrix (“ECM”) coaptation aid for tensionless repair of severed peripheral nerves; 
•Axoguard Nerve Protector®, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to wrap and protect damaged peripheral nerves and reinforce the nerve reconstruction while preventing soft tissue attachments; 
•Axoguard Nerve Cap®, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to protect a peripheral nerve end and separate the nerve from the surrounding environment to reduce the development of symptomatic or painful neuroma;
•Avive® Soft Tissue Membrane, a processed human umbilical cord intended for surgical use as a resorbable soft tissue conduit; and
•Axotouch® Two-Point Discriminator, used to measure the innervation density of any surface area of the skin.
We suspended the market availability of Avive Soft Tissue Membrane ("Avive") effective June 1, 2021 and we continue discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) to determine the appropriate regulatory classification and requirements for Avive. The suspension was not based on any safety or product issues or concerns with Avive. We seek to return Avive to the market, although we are unable to estimate the timeframe or provide any assurances that a return to the market will be achievable. 
The Axogen portfolio of products is available in the U.S., Canada, Germany, United Kingdom ("UK"), Spain, South Korea, and several other countries.

Nerves can be damaged in several ways. When a nerve is cut due to a traumatic injury or inadvertently during a surgical procedure, functionality of the nerve may be compromised, causing the nerve to no longer carry the signals to and from the brain to the muscles and skin thereby reducing or eliminating functionality. The loss of function can impact a person’s ability to work and perform daily tasks, to properly be aware and respond to their environment (e.g., heat, cold or other dangers), and could negatively impact their ability to experience and enjoy life. 
Nerve damage or transection of the type described above generally requires a surgical repair. Traditionally, the standard has been to either suture the nerve ends together directly without tension or to bridge the gap between the nerve ends with a less important nerve surgically removed from elsewhere in the patient’s own body, referred to as nerve autograft. More recently, synthetic or collagen conduits have been used for the repair of short gaps. Nerves that are not repaired or heal abnormally may result in a permanent loss of function and/or sensation. Additionally, abnormal healing can form a neuroma that may send altered signals to the brain resulting in the sensation of pain. This abnormal section of the nerve can, under certain circumstances, be surgically cut out and the resulting gap repaired.
In addition, compression on a nerve, blunt force trauma or other physical irritations to a nerve can cause nerve damage that may alter the signal conduction of the nerve, result in pain, and may, in some instances, require surgical intervention to address the resulting nerve compression. Finally, when a patient undergoes a mastectomy due to breast cancer or prophylactically due to a genetic predisposition for breast cancer, the nerves are cut to allow the removal of the breast tissue. This can result in a loss of sensation, the potential risk of a symptomatic neuroma, and could negatively impact the patient’s quality of life. When a patient chooses an autologous breast reconstruction after a mastectomy, sensation and quality of life can, in certain cases, be returned through surgical nerve repair.

To improve the options available for the surgical repair and regeneration of peripheral nerves, Axogen has developed and licensed regenerative medicine technologies. Axogen’s innovative approach to regenerative medicine has resulted in first-in-class products that it believes are redefining the peripheral nerve repair market. Axogen’s products are used by surgeons during surgical interventions to repair a wide variety of physical nerve damage or transection throughout the body, which can range from a simple laceration of a finger to a complex brachial plexus injury (an injury to the network of nerves that control the movement and sensation of the shoulder, arm, and hand) as well as nerve injuries caused by dental, orthopedic, and other surgical procedures. 
Peripheral Nerve Regeneration Market Overview
Peripheral nerve injury (“PNI”) through damage or transection is a major source of physical disability impairing the ability to move muscles or to feel normal sensations. Patients suffer traumatic bodily injuries every day that may result in damage or transection to peripheral nerves severe enough to require surgical treatment. We break our total addressable market into four categories: (1) Trauma, (2) oral maxillofacial (“OMF”), (3) breast reconstruction neurotization ("Breast") and (4) Upper Extremity Compression (together, the "Total Addressable Market").
We estimate that the U.S. PNI has a potential total addressable market for our current product portfolio of $2.7 billion. Estimating the Total Addressable Market for nerve repair is challenging as there is not a simple data source for the incidence of peripheral nerve issues. This is further complicated by the fact that nerves can be injured through a variety of traumatic and surgical injuries and can be impacted from a patient's head to toe. In addition, we believe nerves are often one of many structures injured in a trauma (i.e., amputation) or in surgery and the incidence of these nerve injuries are often not coded or tracked. Quantifying the procedures involving nerve repair may also be challenging. While selected trauma and surgical procedures are dedicated to the repair of nerves, most of the incidence of nerve repair is a step in a larger trauma or surgical procedure. Current Procedural Terminology ("CPT") codes exist for surgeons to code for nerve repair; however, we believe the data substantially underestimates the total number of nerves repaired. Physicians are encouraged to document all steps of procedures, but open trauma often involves many surgical steps, and CPT codes may be inclusive of each other or may not be documented or reported in billing records. As a result, we believe CPT coding underrepresents the total number of nerve repairs performed in trauma. Because we believe CPT claims are not fully representative of the true volumes of nerve repair surgery, we follow an “empirical” methodology to estimate the Total Addressable Market – using published clinical literature and procedure databases to make what we believe are the most objective assumptions.
Trauma
The "Trauma" portion of the Total Addressable Market encompasses traumatic PNI throughout the body, with approximately 95% of injuries affecting upper and lower extremity nerves. We estimate that the Trauma portion of the Total Addressable Market is approximately $1.9 billion based upon epidemiological studies regarding the general number of trauma patients, clinical literature review reporting PNI incidence, and physician interviews. We have estimated the portion of these nerve repair procedures due to trauma that would require Gap Repair, Primary Repair and/or Nerve Protection and applied, as we believed was appropriate in each procedure segment, the number of units and average sales price of Avance Nerve Graft and the average market price for nerve connectors, and nerve protectors to determine the probable Total Addressable Market.
OMF
We estimate that the OMF portion of the Total Addressable Market is approximately $300 million annually, based upon research indicating that approximately 56,000 PNI occur in the U.S. each year related to third molar surgeries, anesthetic injections, dental implants, orthognathic surgery, and mandibular resection procedures. We have applied the average sales price of the Avance Nerve Graft, Axoguard Nerve Connector, and Axoguard Nerve Protector that address such PNI to derive the OMF portion of the estimated Total Addressable Market.
Breast
We estimate that the Breast portion of the Total Addressable Market is approximately $250 million. Currently, when a patient undergoes autologous breast reconstruction after a mastectomy, the patient receives the shape of a natural breast, but often times experiences little to no return of sensory feeling. In certain cases, sensation can be returned to the breast area with the use of our products through an innovative surgical technique called Resensation®. We believe that the ideal breast reconstruction should restore breast size, shape, symmetry, and softness, as well as sensation, without the potential risks and co-morbidity associated with autograft. We believe the Resensation technique incorporates a patient's desire for the opportunity to return sensation to their breasts with a reproducible and efficient surgical approach for reconstructive plastic surgeons.

Upper Extremity Compression
PNI caused by recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome and cubital tunnel syndrome constitutes the "Upper Extremity Compression" portion of the Total Addressable Market. We estimate that the Upper Extremity Compression portion of the Total Addressable Market is approximately $270 million, or 130,000 procedures. We estimate there are approximately 488,000 primary carpal tunnel and 95,000 primary cubital tunnel relief surgeries performed annually in the U.S. We estimate that approximately 97,500 carpal tunnel revision surgeries and 32,400 total cubital tunnel procedures are addressable each year in the U.S. to mitigate the recurrence of symptoms. These revision and primary surgeries are required due to compression of the peripheral nerve associated with soft tissue attachments from the surrounding tissue or tissue infiltration entrapping the nerve. To prevent additional recurrences, surgeons will opt for a Nerve Protection which includes a product such as the Axoguard Nerve Protector. To derive the carpal and cubital tunnel revision portion of the Total Addressable Market, we multiplied the average market sales price of Axoguard Nerve Protectors by the number of estimated procedures. 
Although distribution and sales of products in the Trauma, OMF, Breast and Upper Extremity Compression portions of the Total Addressable Market constitute our primary revenue sources today, market expansion opportunities in lower extremity surgery, head and neck surgery, urology and the surgical treatment of pain offer us expanded revenue opportunities. The Company has begun an expansion into the surgical treatment of pain with an initial focus on traumatic injuries, including amputation, and orthopedic surgeries such as total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, knee arthroscopy, Morton’s neuroma, foot and ankle procedures, and wrist arthroscopy. The size of the pain market opportunity is challenging to identify as the cause of the chronic pain is often not diagnosed and there has not historically been a surgical treatment to resolve the cause of the pain. The Company believes the market opportunity is sufficient to apply selected resources to the opportunity and there is a significant patient and societal need to reduce the use of pharmacologic solutions, including opioids. 
Axogen’s Product Portfolio
Avance Nerve Graft
Avance Nerve Graft is a biologically active nerve implant with more than ten years of comprehensive clinical evidence and more than 50,000 implants since launch. Avance Nerve Graft is intended for the surgical repair of peripheral nerve transections to support regeneration across the defect (a gap created when the nerve is severed). It is intended to act as a structural bridge in order to guide and support axonal regeneration across a peripheral nerve gap caused by traumatic injury or surgical intervention. Avance Nerve Graft is decellularized and sterile processed human peripheral nerve tissue. Axogen developed Avance Nerve Graft by following the guiding principle that the human body created the optimal peripheral nerve structure. Axogen, through its licensing efforts and research, developed the Avance MethodTM, a proprietary method for processing recovered human peripheral nerve tissue in a manner that preserves the essential structure of the ECM while cleansing away cellular and noncellular debris. Avance Nerve Graft provides the natural peripheral nerve structure of a nerve, including the native laminin to guide the regenerating nerve fibers. The nerve ECM is additionally processed to remove a natural inhibitor to regeneration called chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan.
Axogen believes that Avance Nerve Graft is the first off-the-shelf human nerve allograft for bridging nerve transections. Avance Nerve Graft is comprised of bundles of small diameter endoneurial tubes that are held together by an outer sheath called the epineurium. Avance Nerve Graft has been processed to remove cellular and noncellular factors such as cells, fat, blood, and axonal debris, while preserving the three-dimensional laminin lined tubular bioscaffold (i.e., microarchitecture), epineurium and microvasculature of the peripheral nerve. After processing, Avance Nerve Graft is flexible and pliable, and its epineurium can be sutured in place allowing for tension-free approximation of the proximal and distal peripheral nerve stumps. During the healing process, the body revascularizes and gradually remodels the graft into the patient’s own tissue while allowing the processed peripheral nerve allograft to physically support axonal regeneration across the peripheral nerve transection. Avance Nerve Graft does not require immunosuppression for use.
With lengths up to 70 mm and diameters up to 5 mm, Avance Nerve Graft allows surgeons to choose and trim the implant to the correct length for repairing the relevant peripheral nerve gap, as well as to match the diameter to the proximal and distal end of the severed peripheral nerve. Avance Nerve Graft is stored frozen and utilizes packaging that maintains the graft in a sterile condition. The packaging is typical for medical products so the surgical staff is familiar with opening the package for transfer of Avance Nerve Graft into the sterile surgical field. Such packaging also provides protection during shipment and storage and a reservoir for the addition of sterile fluid to aid in thawing the product. Avance Nerve Graft thaws in less than 10 minutes, and once thawed, it is ready for implantation.

Axoguard Nerve Connector
Axoguard Nerve Connector is a coaptation aid used to align and connect severed peripheral nerve ends in a tensionless repair. The product is in a tubular shape with an open lumen on each end where the severed peripheral nerve ends are placed. It is typically used when the gap between the peripheral nerve ends is 5mm or less in length. Axoguard Nerve Connector is made from a processed porcine ECM that allows the body’s natural healing process to repair the peripheral nerve while its tube shape isolates and protects the transected nerves during the healing process. During healing, the patient’s own cells incorporate into the ECM product to remodel and form a tissue similar to the outermost layer of the peripheral nerve (nerve epineurium). Axoguard Nerve Connector is provided sterile, for single use only, and in a variety of sizes to meet the surgeon’s needs.
Axoguard Nerve Connector can be used:
•As an alternative to direct suture repair;

•Reduces the number of required sutures (versus direct repair with suture);
•Allows surgeon to move sutures away from the repair site which may minimize inflammation and aid nerve regeneration;
•Reduces potential for fascicular mismatch;
•Allows visualization of underlying peripheral nerve ends;
•Available in seven different diameters and two different lengths to address a variety of nerve repair situations;
•Strong and flexible, easy to suture; and
•Stored at room temperature with a minimum of 18-month shelf life.
Axoguard Nerve Protector
Axoguard Nerve Protector is a product used to protect and wrap damaged peripheral nerves and reinforce reconstructed nerve gaps while preventing soft tissue attachments. It is designed to protect and isolate the peripheral nerve during the healing process after surgery by creating a barrier between the nerve tissue and the surrounding tissue bed. The product is delivered in a slit tube format allowing it to be wrapped around peripheral nerve structures. Axoguard Nerve Protector is made from a processed porcine ECM. During healing, the ECM remodels allowing the protector to separate the peripheral nerve from the surrounding tissue. Axoguard Nerve Protector competes against off-the-shelf biomaterials such as reconstituted bovine collagen

Avive is provided sterile and in a variety of sizes to meet the surgeon’s surgical needs. Avive can be used to separate tissues in the surgical bed as a permeable membrane. As previously announced, we suspended the market availability of Avive Soft Tissue Membrane ("Avive") effective June 1, 2021, and we continue discussions with the FDA to determine the appropriate regulatory classification and requirements for Avive. The suspension was not based on any safety or product issues or concerns with Avive. We seek to return Avive to the market, although we are unable to estimate the timeframe or provide any assurances that a return to the market will be achievable. Avive has historically represented approximately 5% of our revenues through the second quarter of 2021, and no Avive revenue was recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2021.

Axoguard Nerve Cap
Axoguard Nerve Cap is a proprietary porcine submucosa ECM product used to protect a peripheral nerve end and separate the nerve from the surrounding environment to reduce the development of symptomatic or painful neuroma.
Nerves are often cut in a variety of surgeries and every nerve that is cut and not reconstructed forms an entangled mass of disorganized nerve and fibrous tissue that could cause debilitating pain called a symptomatic neuroma. Neuromas are a cause of pain for those patients who complain of chronic post-surgical pain, including in amputees which may lead to an inability to use their prosthesis. Despite more than 30 different treatment methods, it is our belief that neuromas continue to be an unresolved problem in microsurgery. We believe the Axoguard Nerve Cap can address these painful neuroma and better address nerve pain than other methods, including pharmacotherapy and chemical injections, among others. Axoguard Nerve Cap can be used to reduce the development of symptomatic or painful neuroma formation.
Axoguard Nerve Cap has the following advantages:
•Separates the nerve end from surrounding tissue, neurotrophic factors and mechanical stimulation;
•Reduces painful neuroma formation;
•Allows for anchoring of a nerve end or stump to nearby tissue structure;
•Material gradually remodels into the patient’s own tissue to protect the nerve end; and
•Semi-translucence allows for visualization of nerve ends or stumps and easy visualization for suture placement.
Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator
The Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator tool can be used to measure the innervation density of any surface area of the skin. The discs are useful for determining sensation after damage to a peripheral nerve, following the progression of a repaired peripheral nerve, and during the evaluation of a person with possible peripheral nerve damage, such as compression. The Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator is a Class 1 510(k) exempt medical device.
The Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator tool is a set of two aluminum discs each containing a series of prongs spaced between two to 15 millimeters apart. Additionally, 20 and 25 millimeter spacing is provided. A circular depression on either side of the disc allows ease of rotation. The discs can be rotated between a single prong for testing one-point and any of the other spaced prongs for testing two-point intervals.
Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator has the following advantages:
•Capable of measuring the innervation density of any skin surface;
•Portable and easy to use;
•Strong aluminum design is resistant to bending;
•Bright colors allow for clear discrimination between discs;
•Clear numbering allows users to interpret results; and
•Reusable carry case protects discs.
Acroval Neurosensory and Motor Testing System
To pursue our mission most effectively, we have made a strategic decision to place our full focus on innovations within our surgical solutions portfolio. Effective November 2019, Axogen discontinued all sales of the Acroval Neurosensory and Motor Testing System. We continue to provide service and support for the existing systems in the marketplace. 
Tissue Recovery and Processing for Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane
Avance Nerve Graft Processing Overview
Axogen has developed the Avance Method, an advanced and proprietary technique to process Avance Nerve Graft from donated human peripheral nerve tissue. The Avance Method requires special training over several months for each manufacturing associate who processes Avance Nerve Grafts. The processing and manufacturing system for Avance Nerve 
Table of Contents

Graft has required significant capital investment, and we seek to continually improve our manufacturing and quality assurance processes and systems. Axogen’s Avance Method is depicted as follows:
Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane Processing
Axogen’s Avance Method and processing of Avive Soft Tissue Membrane consists of several steps, including peripheral nerve tissue, in the case of Avance, and umbilical cord, in the case of Avive, recovery/acquisition and testing, donor medical review and release, processing, packaging, and sterilization to meet or exceed all applicable FDA, state, and international regulations and American Association of Tissue Banks (“AATB”) standards. We have a number of contracts with recovery and acquisition agencies to supply peripheral nerve tissue and umbilical cord and believe these contracts, and the ability to enter into additional contracts, will provide us with the tissues we require for our Avance and Avive implants. As an FDA registered tissue establishment, Axogen utilizes both its own personnel and a variety of subcontractors for recovery/acquisition, storage, testing, processing and sterilization of the donated peripheral nerve and umbilical cord tissue. Additionally, independent Good Manufacturing Practice ("GMP") and Good Laboratory Practice ("GLP") compliant laboratories have been contracted by Axogen and its subcontractors to perform testing from donor eligibility through release. The safety of Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane is supported by donor screening, process validation, process controls, and validated terminal sterilization methods. The Axogen Quality System has built in redundancies that are meant to control the release of each product for implantation only after such product meets our stringent quality control and product requirements.
Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane Tissue Recovery/Acquisition and Processing Facility
Axogen partners with other FDA registered tissue establishments and AATB accredited recovery/acquisition agencies or recovery/acquisition agencies in compliance with FDA, state and international regulations and AATB standards for human tissue recovery. After consent for donation is obtained, donations are screened and tested in detail for safety in compliance with FDA, state and international regulations and AATB standards on communicable disease transmission. Axogen processes and packages Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane using its employees and equipment pursuant to a License and Services Agreement, as amended (the “CTS Agreement”) with Community Blood Center (doing business as Community Tissue Services) (“CTS”), in Dayton, Ohio. CTS is an FDA registered tissue establishment and an AATB accredited organization. Axogen voluntarily suspended the market availability of Avive Soft Tissue Membrane on June 1, 2021.
The current CTS Agreement terminates December 31, 2023, subject to earlier termination by either party at any time for cause (subject to the non-terminating party’s right to cure, in certain circumstances), or without cause upon 6 months prior notice. Under the CTS Agreement, Axogen pays CTS a facility fee for clean room/manufacturing, storage, and office space. CTS also provides services in support of Axogen’s manufacturing such as routine sterilization of daily supplies, providing disposable supplies and microbial services, and office support. The service fee is based on a per donor batch rate. The CTS facility provides a cost effective, quality controlled and licensed facility. Axogen’s processing methods and process controls have been developed and validated to ensure product uniformity and quality. Pursuant to the CTS Agreement, Axogen pays license fees on a monthly basis to CTS. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies - Service Agreements."
Table of Contents

Axogen is renovating a property located near the CTS facility, the Axogen Processing Center facility (the "APC Facility") comprised of a 107,000 square foot building on approximately 8.6 acres of land. It is expected that renovation and validation will be completed before the termination date of the CTS Agreement to provide a new processing facility that can be included in our Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for Avance Nerve Graft. The capacity of the property once operational, along with the ability for expansion, is expected to provide processing capabilities that will meet our intended sales growth. Axogen has obtained certain economic development grants from state and local authorities totaling $2,685 including $1,250 of cash grants to offset costs to acquire and develop the APC Facility. The economic development grants are subject to certain job creation milestones by 2023 and related contingencies. Axogen has received approximately $1,188 from these grants through December 31, 2021. These grants have claw back clauses if Axogen does not meet these job creation milestones by 2023. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies - Service Agreements."
Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane Packaging
After processing, the packaging operation is performed in a controlled environment at the CTS facility. Each Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane is visually inspected and organized by size into finished product codes. The tissue implant is then packaged in primary packaging. The outer pouch acts as the primary sterility and moisture barrier.
Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane Sterilization and Labeling
After being processed and packaged, Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane are then terminally sterilized and shipped to Axogen’s Burleson, Texas distribution facility (the “Distribution Facility”). There the products receive their final labels and are released following a final stringent technical and quality review. Orders for Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane are placed with Axogen’s customer care team and the products are packaged and shipped from the Distribution Facility.
Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane Product Release
Axogen has established quality procedures for review of tissue recovery, relevant donor medical record review and release to processing that meet or exceed FDA requirements as defined in the Code of Federal Regulations ("CFR") 21 CFR Part 1271, state regulations, international regulations and AATB standards. The Axogen Quality System meets the requirements set forth under 21 CFR Part 1271 for Human Cells, Tissues and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, including Good Tissue Practices (“GTP”) and is compliant with the 21 CFR Part 820 Quality System Regulations (“QSR”). Furthermore, Axogen utilizes validated processes for the handling of raw material components, environmental control, processing, packaging, and terminal sterilization. In addition to ongoing monitoring activities for product conformity to specifications and sterility, shipping methods have been validated in accordance with applicable industry standards.
Manufacturing of Axogen Products Other Than Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane
Manufacturing for the Axoguard Product Line
The Axoguard product line is manufactured by Cook Biotech Incorporated, in West Lafayette, Indiana (“Cook Biotech”), which was established in 1995 to develop and manufacture implants utilizing porcine ECM. Axogen decided to expand its portfolio of products and felt that the unique ECM material offered by Cook Biotech provided the combination of properties needed in nerve reconstruction. Cook Biotech’s ECM material is pliable, capable of being sutured, translucent and allows the patient’s own cells to incorporate into the ECM to remodel and form a tissue similar to the nerve’s epineurium. Cook Biotech has its own source of the raw material for the ECM material and manufactures Axoguard products from such sources.
In August 2008, Axogen entered into an agreement with Cook Biotech, amended in February 2012 and February 26, 2018 (the “Distribution Agreement”), to distribute its ECM technology in the form of the Surgisis® Nerve Cuff, the form of a nerve wrap or patch, or the form of any other mutually agreed to configuration. The Surgisis products were rebranded under Axogen’s Axoguard name and consist of the Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector. Axogen’s distribution rights are worldwide in the field of the peripheral and central nervous system but excluding use of the products in the oral cavity for endodontic and periodontal applications and OMF surgery solely as they relate to dental, soft or hard tissue repair, or reconstruction. We believe the exclusion does not limit our identified OMF market, but expansion into certain additional OMF market areas could be limited to other Axogen products not subject to the Distribution Agreement.
Axogen developed, patented, and obtained regulatory approval on the Axoguard Nerve Cap, which in its current configuration is made with Cook Biotech’s ECM material. Pursuant to the Nerve End Cap Supply Agreement dated June 27, 2017 (the “Supply Agreement”), Cook Biotech is the exclusive contract manufacturer of the Axoguard Nerve Cap and both 
Table of Contents

parties have provided the other party the necessary licenses to their technologies for operation of the Supply Agreement. With respect to the license from Cook Biotech, Axogen is able to sell the Axoguard Nerve Cap worldwide in the field of the peripheral and central nervous system, but subject to the same exclusions as Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector.
The Distribution Agreement terminates on June 30, 2027. Although the agreement requires certain minimum purchases, through mutual agreement, the parties have not established such minimums and to date have not enforced such provision, and also establishes a formula for the transfer cost of the Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector. The Supply Agreement has a term through August 27, 2027. 
Manufacturing for the Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator
The Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator was contract manufactured by Viron Technologies, doing business as Cybernetics Research Laboratories (“CRL”), in Tucson, Arizona. CRL supplied the Axotouch unpackaged, and they are packaged at Axogen’s distribution facility in Burleson, Texas. We believe we have enough inventory on hand to support sales through 2024.
Sales and Marketing
Overview
Axogen is focused on developing the peripheral nerve repair and regeneration market, committed to improving awareness of new surgical peripheral nerve repair options and is building additional scientific and clinical data to assist surgeons and patients in making informed choices with respect to the repair of peripheral nerve injuries. Axogen believes that there is an opportunity to improve current approaches to peripheral nerve repair and that its approach will solidify its position as a leader in the field of peripheral nerve repair products. The following provides the key elements of Axogen’s sales and marketing strategy.
Increase Awareness of Axogen’s Products
Prior to the introduction of Axogen’s portfolio of peripheral nerve repair products, surgeons had a limited number of options available to surgically repair damaged or transected peripheral nerves. Axogen entered the market to improve the standard of care for nerve injury patients. Axogen intends to increase market penetration and share by increasing awareness of the impact of nerve damage on quality of life and improving the adoption of nerve repair techniques and Axogen’s products through the continued use of educational conferences and presentations, surgical resident and fellow training, scientific publications, digital communication, and a knowledgeable and professional sales team. Axogen works to increase the use of its products within active accounts as well as expand the overall customer base by adding new active accounts. Axogen defines an active account as an account that has typically gone through the committee approval process, has at least one surgeon who has converted a portion of his or her treatment algorithms for peripheral nerve repair to the Axogen portfolio and has ordered Axogen products at least six times in the last 12 months. As Axogen's business continues to grow, Axogen has transitioned to reporting a new account metric that it believes demonstrates the strength of adoption and potential revenue growth in accounts that have developed a more consistent use of Axogen's products in their nerve repair algorithm. Axogen refers to these as core accounts which it defines as accounts that have purchased at least $100,000 in the past 12 months. Axogen is focused on plastic reconstructive surgeons and orthopedic and plastic hand surgeons who perform surgeries on patients suffering traumatic nerve damage or transection, on oral and maxillofacial surgeons who repair damaged oral nerves, and on plastic reconstructive surgeons who perform autologous flap breast neurotization.
Expand Clinical and Scientific Data Regarding the Performance of Axogen Products
Generating clinical data is an important component of Axogen’s marketing strategy. As of December 31, 2021, there have been over one hundred and eighty-one peer reviewed clinical publications related to Axogen products. Certain of these publications contain data on multiple products. Axogen will continue to accept subjects, for which there are more than 2,500 Avance nerve repairs enrolled to date, in its RANGER® clinical study (defined below in “Government Regulations”), a utilization registry of Avance Nerve Graft. An additional arm of the RANGER study has been initiated, tracking neurotization outcomes in breast reconstruction (Sensation-NOW®). Eleven of the above-mentioned publications and more than 70 scientific conference presentations have been generated to date from the registry. ReThink Pain™, a multicenter observational registry in the area of nerve pain and the surgical treatment of pain, has been initiated and enrollment is underway. A multicenter, prospective, randomized, comparative pilot study of hollow tube conduit and Avance Nerve Graft has completed subject enrollment and outcome follow-up and has been published. Case series in digital nerve repair have been published from the Mayo Clinic, Georgetown University Medical Center and Philadelphia Hand Center, and case series in OMF have been published from UT Southwestern and University of Illinois-Chicago. A number of additional investigator-initiated case reports,

studies, and publications have been completed, including breast neurotization, mandible reconstruction, compressive neuropathies, and the surgical treatment of pain. Case series in brachial plexus, neurotization of breast reconstruction, and the surgical treatment of pain are also being developed. Axogen also supports outside research and will continue to work with investigators on grants with a translational focus.
RECON, a phase 3 pivotal, multicenter, prospective, randomized, comparative study of hollow tube conduits and Avance Nerve Graft to support the transition of Avance to a biological product has completed enrollment and follow-up of all subjects and is in data analysis and interpretation. See “Government Regulations – Clinical Trials.” A multicenter, prospective, randomized, and subject blinded study of Axoguard Nerve Cap as compared to neurectomy alone for the treatment of symptomatic neuroma (REPOSE) is currently enrolling. ASSIST, a registry study of Avive Soft Tissue Membrane in acute trauma has completed follow-up of all enrolled subjects. Sensation-NOW (defined below in "Axogen Clinical Trials"), a RANGER (defined below in "Government Regulations") study arm for breast neurotization continues to enroll, as does the additional expansion arm Matched Autograft and Tube Conduit Case Control Cohort Arm of RANGER ("MATCHSM"), a contemporary cohort control which provides reference controls for nerve autograft and manufactured conduits from participating clinical study centers.
Commitment to the Education of Best Practices in Peripheral Nerve Repair
Axogen has established educational conferences and presentations and surgical resident and fellow training that we believe has positioned us as a leader in providing peripheral nerve repair best practices. In 2021, we trained more than three-quarters of hand and microsurgery surgeon fellows in the U.S. through such courses and training, including the use of virtual education programs necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company has historically provided education on peripheral nerve repair through in-person national programs, including its “Advances and Best Practices in Nerve Repair” as well as local and regional educational events. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we transitioned in April 2020 largely to a virtual platform for surgeon education offering multiple educational webinars. In 2021, we continued to utilize and expand hybrid and virtual education events and also returned to in-person educational events in the last half of 2021. In 2022, we expect to again offer multiple educational webinars including in-person surgeon education programs. Our education efforts also continue to include online tools and discussion forums such as Nerve Matters, an online community of peripheral nerve surgeons where the surgeons can ask questions, present cases, and share findings in the area of peripheral nerve repair.
Focused on developing deeper penetration with our existing surgeon customers through development of long-term users of the Avance Nerve Graft in our largest market opportunity of extremity trauma
Axogen provides full sales and distribution services through both a direct sales force and independent sales agencies. As of December 31, 2021, Axogen had 115 direct sales professionals in the U.S. and approximately 28 independent sales agencies in the U.S. In 2021, approximately 88% of global product revenue came from the direct channel. We believe that near-term growth can be supported first through expanded productivity of our existing sales force as they go deeper with existing surgeons and accounts and then by adding additional surgeons and accounts. We expect the number of direct sales professionals to increase over time. Additionally, we have successfully utilized a hybrid commercial approach that includes the use of independent agencies in more remote geographies to provide appropriate local support for surgeons, without the travel time required of a direct sales representative. We anticipate that we will continue to add to the number of independent sales agencies as we continue to drive higher productivity and efficiency with our direct sales force. 
Our products are available and sold in 17 countries outside the U.S. through a number of independent in-country distributors. We provide support and resources for independent agencies and distributors both within and outside the U.S. We provide our products to hospitals, surgery centers and military hospitals, calling on surgeons, including plastic reconstructive surgeons, orthopedic and plastic hand surgeons, and certain oral and maxillofacial surgeons to review the benefits of our products. While surgeons make the decision to implant our products in appropriate patients, hospitals make the decision to purchase the products from us. In today’s budget constrained environment, hospital committees review new technologies for cost effectiveness as well as quality. We believe that we have been successful in meeting the needs of these hospital committees by demonstrating the cost/benefit of our products and providing a fair value to the hospital. 
Expand the Product Pipeline and Applications in Peripheral Nerve Repair
Axogen has developed and continues to develop new and next generation products to support surgeons in their needs for repairing damaged or transected peripheral nerves. Axogen believes additional opportunities exist to develop or acquire complementary products in peripheral nerve repair. In addition, there are opportunities to expand the existing portfolio of products in new applications of peripheral nerve repair in lower extremity surgery, head and neck surgery, urology, and the surgical treatment of pain.

Avance Nerve Graft Performance
Axogen has worked with leading institutions, researchers, and surgeons to support innovation in the field of surgical peripheral nerve repair. We believe Axogen’s RANGER study (defined below in “Government Regulations”) is the largest multi-center clinical study conducted in peripheral nerve gap repair. Axogen is also conducting the RECON study (defined below in "Axogen Clinical Trials"). This study is a phase 3 trial to support its BLA for the Avance Nerve Graft. See “Government Regulations - Clinical Trials - Axogen Clinical Trials”. 
International Opportunity for Revenue
Axogen currently focuses primarily on the U.S. market, with additional foreign distribution and sales in Canada, Germany, UK, Spain, South Korea, and certain other countries. The need for the surgical repair of damaged or transected nerves is a global opportunity. Through its revenue outside the U.S., Axogen has demonstrated the capability to take its current peripheral nerve repair surgical portfolio into new geographical markets. Axogen currently has European Union (“E.U.”)-wide registration only for Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector as approval/registration for Avance Nerve Graft as human tissue is required in each individual country. Avance Nerve Graft has been granted marketing authorization in Germany and direct commercial operations began in 2022. Currently, Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator is available only in the U.S. Such introduction is subject to meeting the appropriate regulatory standards of particular countries and any appropriate E.U.-wide regulation or directive. In addition to regulatory approval, reimbursement approval is necessary to achieve material product adoption in most countries. Avance Nerve graft has achieved NICE approval in the UK for digital nerve repair and reimbursement approval in South Korea for repairs up to 50mm in length. To date, revenue from international distribution and sales have not been material, there are no material risks associated with foreign operations and we do not have dependencies as to international revenue. See "Risk Factors – Our operations must comply with FDA and other governmental requirements." 
Research and Development
Axogen believes it provides the most extensive product portfolio for peripheral nerve injuries available. Our current development focus is to expand clinical data in both traumatic peripheral nerve repair and other surgical applications and to develop product line extensions of the Avance and Axoguard products. Other peripheral nerve repair technologies may also be developed.
Axogen works with academic institutions in the expansion of treatments for peripheral nerve and is involved in a number of grants from government agencies related to nerve repair or use of our products and/or technologies. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Axogen spent approximately $24.2 million on total research and development expenses for product and clinical development.
Competition
The medical device and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. As such, Axogen cannot predict what products may be offered in the future that may compete with Axogen’s products. In the peripheral nerve repair market, Axogen competes primarily against all transected and non-transected peripheral nerve repair approaches, including direct suture repair, autograft, and hollow-tube nerve conduits and materials used to wrap and protect damaged peripheral nerve tissue. Finally, there are numerous companies that offer amnion products in a variety of formats, primarily in the area of wound care, which could be competitive with Axogen’s Avive product.
Because the requirements of the biomaterials used in peripheral nerve repair can vary based on the severity and location of the damaged nerve, the size and function of the nerve, surgical technique, and patient preference, Axogen’s peripheral nerve repair products compete against both autograft materials (nerve in the case of a bridging repair and vein or fat in the case of a nerve protection repair), and a limited number of off-the-shelf alternatives for grafting and protecting. Competitive aspects of our products focus on their overall value proposition and suitability for specific applications and can include composition and structure of the material, ease of use, clinical evidence, handling, and price. Axogen’s major competitors for off-the-shelf repair options in hollow-tube conduits and bio-absorbable wraps are Integra LifeSciences Holding Corporation, Baxter International, Inc., and Stryker Corporation.
Axogen believes any current or future competitors face the following important barriers to market entry as it relates to its peripheral nerve repair products. Axogen’s intellectual property (“IP”), and that of its partners, including patents, patents-pending, trade secrets, and know how, is believed to be an important barrier for its Avance Nerve Graft and Axoguard products. Axogen has developed knowledge and experience in understanding and meeting FDA regulatory requirements for Avance Nerve Graft, including having made a substantial investment in conducting the pre-clinical and clinical testing necessary to support a submission for an FDA BLA. Additionally, Axogen believes its ability to offer a portfolio of products focused on 
Table of Contents

peripheral nerve repair provides a unique competitive position versus other entities that do not have this breadth of product offering. However, due to its limited resources, its smaller size, and its relatively early stage, Axogen believes it may face competitive challenges from larger entities and market factors that could negatively impact Axogen’s growth, including competitors’ introduction of new products and competitors’ bundling of products to achieve pricing benefits.
Intellectual Property
Overview
Axogen protects its IP through a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and copyrights. In addition, Axogen safeguards its trade secrets and other confidential know-how, and carefully protects these and other IP rights when engaging with third parties. For example, Axogen requires vendors, contract organizations, consultants, advisors, and employees to execute confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, and to appropriately protect any information disclosed to them by Axogen so as to preserve its confidential and/or trade secret status. Axogen also requires consultants, advisors, and employees to assign their rights to any IP arising out of their relationship with Axogen to Axogen.
License Agreements
Axogen has entered into license agreements with University of Florida Research Foundation (the “UFRF”) and the University of Texas at Austin (“UTA”). Under the terms of these license agreements, Axogen holds exclusive worldwide licenses to underlying technologies used by Axogen in its Avance Nerve Graft. The license agreements include both the right to issued patents and patents pending in the U.S. and international markets. The effective term of the license agreements extends through the term of the related patents. Currently, Axogen pays royalties to UFRF and UTA specific to the licensed technologies related to Avance Nerve Graft.
Patents
As of the date of this Form 10-K, Axogen owns or is the exclusive licensee of about thirty issued U.S. patents, more than thirty-five pending U.S. patent applications (including those for which Axogen has received a notice of allowance) and more than one hundred and forty international patents and patent applications with regard to its peripheral nerve products and other related technologies. 
With respect to our Avance Nerve Graft, we have patent protection in the U.S. through at least September 2023. In addition, we have a period of 12 years total exclusivity in the U.S. for reference product- meaning protection from biosimilars for 12 years. Finally, Axogen has Enforcement Discretion from the FDA allowing continued distribution under controls applicable to Human Cellular and Tissue-based Products (“HCT/P”) with an agreed transition plan to a Biologic Product under a BLA. We believe a competitive processed peripheral nerve allograft would need to successfully complete BLA Phase I, II and III clinical studies prior to clinical release, the completion of which we believe would take at least eight years.
Axogen’s policy is to seek patent protection for, or where strategically preferable, maintain as trade secret, the inventions that it considers important to its products and the development of its business. Axogen has sought, and will continue to seek, patent protection for select proprietary technologies and other inventions emanating from its research and development ("R&D"), including with respect to uses, methods, and compositions, in an effort to further fortify its IP stronghold in areas of importance to the company and its growing product portfolio. In instances that patent protection is not possible, product value to Axogen’s portfolio can still be derived.
Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Copyrights
Axogen holds a significant portfolio of hundreds of registered and applied-for trademarks in the U.S. and worldwide. Protection of our trademarks allows Axogen to prevent competitors from, for example, using the same or a confusingly similar company name, or the same or confusingly similar product names within identified classes of goods that could otherwise wrongfully allow such competitors to capitalize on the Axogen brand, reputation, and goodwill, and thereby improperly bolster their sales or reputations through, for example, consumer confusion, a false indication of Axogen’s endorsement, or of a false indication of corporate or contractual relationship with Axogen. Axogen polices and enforces its marks. 
Axogen possesses trade secrets and material know-how in the following general subject matters: nerve and tissue processing, nerve repair, product testing methods, and pre-clinical and clinical expertise. Axogen has registered copyrights for training tools and artistic renderings. Additionally, Axogen entered into the Distribution Agreement and Supply Agreement with Cook Biotech for the Axoguard products. Cook Biotech believes it has know-how and trade secrets with respect to its ECM technology that provides certain competitive obstacles to protect Axogen's IP.

Government Regulations
U.S. Government Regulation Overview
Axogen’s products are subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the U.S. and comparable authorities in other countries. In addition, its Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane must comply with the standards of the tissue bank industry’s accrediting organization, the AATB.
Axogen distributes Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector products for Cook Biotech, and Cook Biotech is responsible for the regulatory compliance of these products. Cook Biotech is the contract manufacturer for our Axoguard Nerve Cap product and Axogen is responsible for the regulatory compliance of this product. Axoguard products are regulated as medical devices and subject to pre-market notification requirements under section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”), 21 CFR Part 820 (“Quality System Regulation”), and related laws and regulations. Cook Biotech has obtained a 510(k) pre-market clearance for Axoguard Nerve Connector from the FDA for the use of porcine small intestine submucosa for the repair of peripheral nerve transections where gap closure can be achieved by flexion of the extremity. Cook Biotech has also obtained a 510(k) pre-market clearance for Axoguard Nerve Protector for the repair of peripheral nerve damage in which there is no gap or where a gap closure is achieved by flexion of the extremity. We sell the 510(k) cleared devices under the trade names Axoguard Nerve Protector and Axoguard Nerve Connector.
Axogen also sells the Axoguard Nerve Cap product, which is classified by the FDA as a Class II device. The Axoguard Nerve Cap was cleared for market under 510(k) K163446. It is classified by FDA under 21 CFR 882.5275 (Nerve Cuff, product code: JXI).
Axogen is responsible for the regulatory compliance of Avive Soft Tissue Membrane, which Axogen suspended the market availability of effective June 1, 2021. We continue discussions with the FDA to determine the appropriate regulatory classification and requirements for Avive. The suspension was not based on any safety or product concerns with Avive. Axogen also distributes the Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator. This device is manufactured for Axogen and distributed from the Burleson Facility. It is a Class I device (general controls) that is exempt from pre-market notification and the Quality System Regulation requirements except for the Recordkeeping and Complaint file requirements. It is classified by FDA under 21 CFR 882.1200 (Two-point discriminator, product code: GWI).
FDA — General
FDA regulations govern nearly all the activities that Axogen performs, or that are performed on its behalf, to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses. The activities the FDA regulates include the following:
•Product design, development, and manufacture;
•Product safety, testing, labeling, and storage;
•Pre-clinical testing in animals and in the laboratory;
•Clinical investigations in humans;
•Pre-marketing clearance, approval, or licensing;
•Record-keeping and document-retention procedures;
•Advertising and promotion;
•The import and export of products;
•Product marketing, sales, and distribution;
•Post-marketing surveillance and medical device reporting, including reporting of deaths, serious injuries, communicable diseases, device malfunctions, or other adverse events; and
•Corrective actions, removals and recalls.
Failure to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements may subject Axogen to a variety of administrative or judicially imposed penalties or sanctions and/or prevent it from obtaining or maintaining required approvals, clearances, or licenses to manufacture and market its products. It could also subject Axogen to enforcement actions or sanctions, such as agency refusal to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution of products, injunctions, or civil monetary penalties or criminal prosecution.
FDA’s Pre-market Clearance and Approval Requirements - Medical Devices
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device distributed commercially in the U.S. requires either a 510(k) pre-market notification submission or a Pre-Market Approval (“PMA”) Application to the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of 
Table of Contents

three classes—Class I, Class II, or Class III—depending on the degree of risk, the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of each medical device and how much is known about the type of device. For devices first intended for marketing after May 28, 1976, pre-market review and clearance by the FDA for Class I and II medical devices is accomplished through the 510(k) pre-market notification procedure by finding a device substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class I or II device, unless the device is exempt. The majority of Class I medical devices are exempt from the 510(k) pre-market notification requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices for which Class II controls are inadequate to assure safety or effectiveness, and novel devices, including devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. Class III devices generally require an approved PMA prior to marketing.
A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction, and the safety and effectiveness of the device.
Biological Product License Application (BLA) Pathway
Biological products require FDA approval of a BLA to be marketed. To be approved, a BLA must demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of the product candidate based on results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. A BLA must also contain extensive Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls ("CMC") and other manufacturing information, and the applicant must pass an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the biologic product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice ("cGMP") requirements. Satisfaction of FDA approval requirements for biologics typically takes several years and the actual time required may vary substantially based on the type, complexity, and novelty of the product. Axogen cannot be certain that any BLA approvals for its products will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
The steps for obtaining FDA approval of a BLA to market a biologic product in the U.S. include:
•Completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies under the FDA’s good laboratory practices regulations;
•Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application ("IND") for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and which must include independent Institutional Review Board, ("IRB"), approval at each clinical site before the trials may be initiated;
•Performance of an adequate and well-controlled clinical trial in accordance with Good Clinical Practices to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each indication;
•Submission to the FDA of a BLA, which contains detailed information about the CMC for the product, reports of the outcomes and full data sets from the clinical trials, and proposed labeling and packaging for the product;
•Satisfactory review of the contents of the BLA by the FDA, including the satisfactory resolution of any questions raised during the review;
•Satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
•Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations, to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to ensure the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity; and
•FDA approval of the BLA, including agreement on post-marketing commitments, if applicable.
Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some pre-clinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials and or supporting pre-clinical data as outlined in the IND. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. Therefore, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Axogen met with the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research ("CBER") in July 2010 and, between July 2010 and November 2010, provided information to CBER that resulted in the FDA issuing a letter stating the agency’s intent to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the continued introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of Avance Nerve Graft assuming that certain conditions were met relating to the transition of Avance Nerve Graft from regulation as an HCT/P under Section 361 to a biological product under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. Specifically, the FDA is permitting Avance Nerve Graft to be distributed, subject to FDA enforcement discretion, provided that:
Table of Contents

•Axogen transitions to compliance with Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act, the current cGMP regulations in 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 and the applicable regulations and standards in 21 CFR Parts 600-610 prior to initiation of a phase 3 clinical trial designed to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of Avance Nerve Graft.
◦Axogen has performed several gap analyses of its quality system for compliance with 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 and 600-610 regulations. The gap analyses have identified areas in which our quality system could improve with respect to compliance with the regulations. The transition is in process and we periodically review the 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 and 600-610 regulations to ensure that we create and implement appropriate changes, including new quality procedures. Through our internal auditing process, we periodically assess our compliance to the regulations. As Axogen completes the phase 3 clinical trial and eventual BLA submission, we will retain an external audit firm with experience in auditing to 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 and 600-610 regulations to verify quality system compliance with the regulations.
•Axogen conducts a phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety, purity and potency of Avance Nerve Graft under a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”).
◦Axogen and the FDA agreed to the SPA in August 2011 and in accordance with FDA regulations in 21 CFR §Part 312, Axogen submitted an IND to the FDA in April 2013. The IND was approved and became effective in March 2015 and the phase 3 clinical trial was initiated in the second quarter of 2015. The study completed initial enrollment in January 2019. As required by the SPA and agreed to by FDA and Axogen, an independent statistical analysis was conducted to determine if greater study enrollment was appropriate to maintain the planned statistical power of the trial. As part of that review, the targeted enrollment was increased to 220 subjects, and the number of participating centers was increased to up to 25. The study completed initial subject enrollment in July 2020 and the last patient last visit followup was in August 2021. No outcome data is available at this time.
•Axogen continues to comply with the regulations and standards under 21 CFR Part 1271.
◦Axogen was audited by the FDA at its processing facility in March 2013, March 2015 and October 2016 and at its Distribution Facility in October 2015. The quality system was found to be in compliance with 21 CFR Part 1271 and no FDA Form 483 observations were issued.
◦In February 2018. Axogen was audited by the FDA with respect to its Medical Device Quality System under 21 CFR Part 820 and its Human Tissue Quality System under 21 CFR Part 1271. Such audit resulted in two Form 483 observations on general procedures on our Medical Device Quality System and no Form 483 observations on our Human Tissue Quality System. Axogen has taken corrective action to correct these observations and the FDA has accepted the corrective action plan.
◦In November 2018, Axogen was audited again by the FDA with respect to its Human Tissue Quality System under 21 CFR Part 1271. Such audit resulted in one Form 483 observation on tissue tracking. Axogen has taken corrective action to correct this observation and the FDA has accepted the corrective action plan.
Axogen is working with the FDA to ensure compliance with applicable regulations regarding the transition of Axogen's quality system to 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 and 600-610 compliance and through audits for compliance to 21 CFR Part 1271. Axogen also maintains regular communication with the FDA regarding the IND. The final determination of regulatory compliance will be made by the FDA during the pre-license inspection as part of the BLA review. If the FDA does not find Axogen to be in compliance, or if Axogen is unable to meet the required standards for pre-clinical studies, clinical studies and CMC, the approval of the BLA could be delayed or denied.
Axogen has marketed Avance since 2007. In 2010, the FDA provided Axogen with an enforcement discretion letter authorizing the marketing of Avance so long as Axogen complied with certain terms that focused the Company on taking the necessary steps to support a BLA submission for the product. The FDA will end the period of enforcement discretion upon a final determination of Axogen’s future BLA submission or if prior to the BLA submission, the FDA finds that Axogen does not meet the conditions for the transition plan or is not exercising due diligence in executing the transition (e.g., study completion, or BLA submission is neither timely nor adequate). If final action on the BLA is negative or Axogen is found to not meet the conditions for the transition plan or its execution, Axogen will not be able to continue to distribute Avance Nerve Graft. Axogen continues to work diligently to execute the transition plan, including maintaining regular communication with the FDA, and, in this context, continues to distribute Avance Nerve Graft.
The BLA application of Avance Nerve Graft, if approved, will require a potentially substantial user fee payment to the FDA, although certain exemptions, waivers and discounts of the user fees may apply, including certain waivers or discounts for small businesses.
The FDA Reauthorization Act ("FDARA"), which was signed into law on August 18, 2017, amended the FD&C Act. FDARA includes the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012, which authorizes the FDA to continue to collect the 
Table of Contents

following user fees from applicants who submit certain new drug and biological product applications and supplements. The fees are updated each federal fiscal year:
•Application Fee: Each new BLA has a fee required at the time of submission. For Axogen fiscal year 2022 (through September 2022 – the FDA resets the fee starting in October of each year), this fee for a BLA requiring clinical data was approximately $3.1 million. Since the fee is adjusted each year, we cannot provide an accurate estimate of what our fee will be upon submission of our BLA. For small companies (fewer than 500 employees and no other approved biologic product on the market) submitting its first application, a waiver of the application fee is available.
•Program Fee: A program fee is assessed for each strength or potency in which the approved (non-revoked, non-suspended) product is manufactured in final dosage form. The program fee is based on an estimate of the number of products that would be subject to, and for which the companies would pay, program fees. The program fee is determined by dividing the adjusted total fee revenue from program fees by the number of estimated products (based on previous year’s program fees) subject to the program fee (excluding program fee waivers and reductions granted by the FDA). For Axogen fiscal year 2022 (through September 2022 – the FDA resets the fee starting in October of each year), the program fee has been established at $0.364 million. Axogen may have to pay a program fee after BLA approval. 
The current version of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA") expires on October 1, 2022. Congress must reauthorize the program by September 30, 2022. New user fee amounts will be determined during the reauthorization process. In addition, the PDUFA legislation may contain other provisions that modify sections of FD&C Act. The future version of PDUFA is unknown at this time and we cannot provide an accurate description on how the future version of PDUFA will have on our BLA submission. 
In September 2018, the FDA granted a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy ("RMAT") designation for Avance Nerve Graft. A regenerative medicine therapy is eligible for the designation if it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. The RMAT designation provides access to a streamlined approval process for regenerative medicine technologies and ensures continued informal meetings with the FDA in support of the BLA for Avance Nerve Graft.
The Company believes that any future, competitive peripheral nerve allograft would be required to follow the standard pathway for biologic licensing, which typically entails multiple clinical trials and takes many years. The FDA provided updated guidance, "Regulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use" in November 2017 (revised in July 2020), which made clear that any processing that alters the biological characteristics of peripheral nerve tissue would be considered more than minimal manipulation, and therefore require a BLA prior to marketing.
The Company has maintained a collaborative dialogue with the FDA and will continue to work closely with the FDA as it progresses towards its BLA submission. Upon BLA approval, we believe Avance Nerve Graft will have 12 years of data exclusivity with regard to potential biosimilars with Avance Nerve Graft being designated as the Reference Product.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are required to support a BLA or PMA and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under strict requirements to ensure the protection of human subjects participating in the trial and under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring and safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Clinical trials for biological products require the submission and FDA acceptance of an IND and clinical trials for medical devices require the submission and FDA approval of an Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") application unless the device regulations provide for an exemption from the IDE requirement. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE is approved by the FDA and the IRB overseeing the particular clinical trial. If the product is considered a non-significant risk device under FDA regulations, the trial must only be approved by an IRB prior to its initiation. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND or IDE, for significant risk devices. In addition, for these studies, an IRB at each site at which the study is conducted must approve the protocol, subject consent form and any amendments for each site at which the study is conducted. All research subjects must be informed, among other things, about the risks and benefits of the investigational product and provide their informed consent in writing.
Table of Contents

Clinical trials under an IND typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. In Axogen’s case, Axogen believes that the phase 3 clinical trial study for Avance Nerve Graft represents the only prospective clinical data that will be required to evaluate safety and effectiveness. Phase 3 clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety in an expanded patient population. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve comparison with placebo, standard treatments, or other comparators. Usually multiple well-controlled large phase 3 or pivotal clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy are required to support a BLA. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Clinical testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA or Axogen may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are exposed to an unacceptable health risk, have experienced a serious and unexpected adverse event, or that continued use in an investigational setting may be unethical. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of research, for example, if the research is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the research has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally clinical data obtained from the observational study, RANGER, will be provided as supportive safety data.
Axogen Clinical Trials
Axogen has an active clinical research program to gather data on its product portfolio. Axogen has completed two clinical studies and is performing six ongoing clinical studies and has plans to initiate further clinical studies. The ongoing studies are: 
•“A Multicenter Retrospective Study of Avance Nerve Graft Utilization, Evaluations, and Outcomes in Peripheral Nerve Injury Repair (“RANGER”)”, 
•"A Matched Autograft and Tube Conduit Case Control Cohort Arm of RANGER ("MATCH")",
•“A Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized, Patient and Evaluator Blinded Comparative Study of Nerve Cuffs and Avance Nerve Graft Evaluating Recovery Outcomes for the Repair of Nerve Discontinuities (“RECON”)", 
•Breast Neurotization Outcomes for Women: A Registry Study of Recovery Outcomes, Quality of Life and Patient Satisfaction in Post-Mastectomy Autologous Breast Reconstruction ("Sensation-NOW")", 
•A Multicenter, Prospective and Subject Blinded Comparative Study of Axoguard Nerve Cap and Neurectomy for the Treatment of Symptomatic Neuroma and Prevention of Recurrent End-Neuroma Pain ("REPOSE"), and
•"An Ambispective, Multicenter, Observational Registry Study of Patients Considering Surgical Treatment for Chronic Neuropathic Pain ("ReThink Pain")." 
With the voluntary suspension of marketing for Avive Soft Tissue Membrane, the following study has stopped recruiting: "A Registry of Avive Soft Tissue Membrane Utilization in Selected Applications of Acute Trauma in the Upper Extremity ("ASSIST").
Completed studies are “A Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized, Comparative Study of Hollow Nerve Conduit and Avance Nerve Graft Evaluation Recovery Outcomes of the Nerve Repair in the Hand (“CHANGE”)” published by Means et al and a pilot study to evaluate the use of Avance Nerve Graft in the reconstruction of nerves following prostatectomy.
In addition to these clinical research programs, Axogen is developing additional clinical trials in peripheral nerve repair, including mixed and motor nerve repair, breast neurotization and pain.
Clinical trials are subject to extensive recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Axogen’s clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an IRB for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to, those relating to Good Clinical Practices. Axogen is also required to obtain the patients’ written, informed consent in a form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. Axogen, the FDA or the IRB may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the biological product or device, or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA approval to market the product in the U.S. Similarly, in the E.U., the clinical study for a medicine product must be authorized by the Competent Authority in each Member State where the clinical trial is to be conducted and must receive a favorable opinion from an ethics committee. See "Risk Factors - Clinical trials can be long, expensive and results are ultimately uncertain, which could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval and continue to market our Avance Nerve Graft product".

RANGER
The RANGER study is an observational study currently in enrollment and is a utilization registry of Avance Nerve Graft. As of December 31, 2021, eleven publications and more than 70 scientific conference presentations have been generated to date from the study. RANGER is designed to allow up to 2,500 subjects. An additional 500 subjects are allowed to be enrolled in Addendum 1, MATCH, and 2,000 enrolled in Addendum 2, Sensation-NOW. Sensation-NOW is a clinical study cohort designed to assess breast sensation following reconstruction with or without neurotization. Axogen resumed enrollment in 2021 at select centers after pausing enrollment due to COVID-19 in 2020. The follow-up for the RANGER study is standard of care with a target of up to 36 months post peripheral nerve repair. At the time of BLA submission for Avance Nerve Graft, Axogen will provide to the FDA Real World Evidence based primarily on Real World Data from the RANGER study data for all qualifying peripheral nerve repairs. 
The RANGER study database is also utilized to monitor different nerve repair techniques. As part of this, Axogen utilizes the database to support additional regulatory submissions for the Axoguard products and Avance Nerve Graft. 
Axogen has worked with leading institutions, researchers, and surgeons to support innovation in the field of surgical peripheral nerve repair. Axogen believes that RANGER is currently the largest multi-center observational clinical study conducted in peripheral nerve gap repair. Axogen’s RECON study will also continue our clinical work, providing a new multi-center, prospective, randomized, clinical study on Avance Nerve Graft. Various reviewers of the RANGER study have found Avance Nerve Graft nerve repairs resulted in meaningful motor and sensory recovery and reduced pain following neuroma excision and reconstruction with no safety concerns identified. 
RECON
The RECON study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, patient and evaluator blinded, comparative study of Avance Nerve Graft and Collagen Nerve Cuffs (manufactured conduits) in the repair of peripheral nerve transections in digital nerves with gaps of 5 to 25mm. The study is designed to assess the outcomes of peripheral nerve repair in approximately 170 subjects in up to 20 centers. Subjects were intraoperatively randomized in a 1:1 ratio after stratification by length of the nerve injury by gap length into short gap (5-14mm) and long gap (15-25mm) categories. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Avance Nerve Graft for non-inferiority and if met, superiority, of static two-point discrimination, a measure of sensory function, at twelve months as compared to nerve cuffs. Given the pooled standard deviation assumptions and a non-inferiority margin of 2mm, approximately 88 patients per treatment group are required to assess non-inferiority with at least 83% power. In addition to non-inferiority, a minimum treatment effect is required to be demonstrated. Based on an agreement with the FDA in the original protocol and an independent statistical analysis of the pooled standard deviation, the number of subjects was increased to 220 in up to 25 centers. Subjects were followed over the course of 12 months (based on the agreed-upon protocol, subjects have up to an additional three months to complete trial requirements) to assess safety and efficacy outcomes with assessments performed at various defined intervals up to 12 months. The study completed subject enrollment in July 2020. Subject follow-up was completed in August 2021. The study remains on schedule with a top line study data read-out expected in the second quarter of 2022, followed by filing of the BLA submission in 2023.
REPOSE
Axogen is conducting a multicenter, prospective, randomized, and subject blinded study of Axoguard Nerve Cap as compared to neurectomy for the treatment of systematic neuroma ("REPOSE"). REPOSE is a two-phase study comparing standard neurectomy to Axoguard Nerve Cap, which leverages Axogen’s chambered technology to aid in the management of symptomatic neuromas. The first phase, a non-randomized pilot has completed enrollment and one-year follow-up. The second phase, a prospective, randomized controlled study, is actively enrolling. Overall enrollment is designed to target 101 subjects with 15 in the first pilot phase followed by up to 86 in the randomized, comparative phase. The study will assess pain scores, quality of life, neuroma recurrence, and health outcomes over a 12-month follow-up period. 
ReThink Pain
ReThink Pain is a prospective and retrospective, multicenter, observational clinical study of patients considering surgical treatment for chronic neuropathic pain. Enrollment resumed in 2021 after pausing in 2020 due to COVID-19. ReThink Pain evaluates a patient's healthcare journey and pain history through detailed medical history and record review. For patients who undergo surgical treatment for pain, standardized outcome measures such as post-operative pain, pain medication usage, quality of life outcomes, and functional outcome of associated nerves as compared to pre-operative levels will be assessed.

Continuing Regulation
There are numerous regulatory requirements that apply after a product is cleared or approved. For medical devices, these include, but are not limited to the FDA’s regulations for device labeling (21 CFR Part 801), medical device reporting (21 CFR Part 803), reporting of corrections and removals (21 CFR Part 806), establishment of registration and device listing requirements (21 CFR Part 807); and compliance with the QSR per 21 CFR Part 820. Distribution of medical devices is also subject to license/registration requirements in some states. For tissue and biologic products, the regulatory requirements include: the FDA’s registration and listing requirements, donor eligibility requirements and compliance with GTP in 21 CFR Part 1271 for human tissue products, compliance with the FDA’s cGMP in 21 CFR Parts 210, 211, and 600 for licensed biological products, and post-market BLA requirements (21 CFR Part 601). Among other things, these regulations require manufacturers, including third party manufacturers to:
•Follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
•Comply with labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the false or misleading promotion or the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses, or indications;
•Comply with requirements to obtain clearance or approval for certain changes affecting the product, including changes to the product’s manufacturing, labeling, or intended use;
•Report to the FDA certain adverse events, adverse reactions, and deviations;
•Comply with post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments and post-market safety and annual reporting requirements;
•Follow post-market surveillance regulations that may apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; and
•Follow requirements to issue notices of correction or removal, or conduct market withdrawals, or recalls where quality or other issues arise.
Axogen has not received any reports of adverse events where the event was determined to be product related for Avance Nerve Graft or Avive Soft Tissue Membrane products. Although Axogen has voluntarily suspended marketing of Avive, the suspension was not due to a recall or any safety concerns. Nine adverse events have been reported by Cook Biotech for the Axoguard products (one each in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2020; and two each in 2017 and 2019). Axogen reported three biological deviations (two in 2018 and one in 2019) for quality system issues related to human tissue distribution (no patient safety issues were involved). In December 2020, a user facility presented a Medwatch report for Avance Nerve Graft for a sizing issue and potential delay in procedure. Axogen follow up indicated that there was no delay in procedure and Axogen is filing subsequent information to the FDA on this event. Axogen has not had to submit any Medical Device Reports (“MDRs”) or tissue adverse reaction reports to the FDA. Although Axogen’s Axoguard products have had just nine adverse events reported to date, there may have been other incidents, including patient deaths, that may have occurred during procedures utilizing Axogen’s products without Axogen being aware of any such incidents. In addition, there can be no assurance that in the future Axogen’s products will not cause or contribute to an adverse event that would require Axogen to submit MDRs, biological deviation reports, or tissue adverse reaction reports to the FDA.
In addition to the FDA, the advertising and promotion of medical products are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and in some instances by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, some promotional activities for FDA-regulated products have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the Federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors, and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims.
All Axogen locations are properly registered with the FDA as tissue establishments for Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. Axogen is subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the GTP, GMP, and other regulations, and these inspections may also include suppliers' manufacturing facilities.
Failure by Axogen or by Axogen’s suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other federal or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions, among others:
•Warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•Customer notifications, repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;
•Operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production;
•Suspension or termination of our clinical trials;
•Refusing our PMA or BLA for new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;
•Withdrawing or spending pre-market approvals that have already been granted; and

•Criminal prosecution.
Education Grants, U.S. Anti-kickback, False Claims and Other Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
Educational Grants
A medical product manufacturer may provide financial or in-kind support, including support by way of grants, to third parties for the purpose of conducting medical educational activities. If these supported activities are considered by the FDA to be independent of the manufacturer, then the activities fall outside the FDA restrictions on promotion to which the manufacturer is subject.
Axogen seeks to ensure that the educational activities it supports through its grants program are in accordance with the appropriate criteria for independent educational activities. However, Axogen cannot provide assurance that the FDA or other government authorities would view the programs supported as being independent.
Fraud, Abuse and False Claims
Axogen is directly and indirectly subject to various federal and state laws governing relationships with healthcare providers and pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws. In particular, the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Penalties for violations could include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. In implementing the statute, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) has issued a series of regulations, known as “safe harbors.” These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute for activities that fit within a safe harbor. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable element of a safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG, and may be “at risk” activities unless a favorable advisory opinion is obtained from the OIG.
The Federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) imposes civil liability on any person or entity that submits, or causes the submission of, a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government. Damages under the FCA can be significant and consist of the imposition of fines and penalties. The FCA also allows a private individual or entity with knowledge of past or present fraud against the federal government to sue on behalf of the government to recover the civil penalties and treble damages. The U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") has previously alleged that the marketing and promotional practices of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers including the off-label promotion of products or the payment of prohibited kickbacks to doctors violated the FCA resulting in the submission of improper claims to federal and state healthcare entitlement programs such as Medicaid. 
AdvaMed is one of the primary voluntary U.S. trade associations for medical device manufacturers. This association has established guidelines and protocols for medical device manufacturers in their relationships with healthcare professionals on matters, including research and development, product training and education, grants and charitable contributions, support of third-party educational conferences, and consulting arrangements. Adoption of the AdvaMed Code by a medical device manufacturer is voluntary, and while the OIG and other federal and state healthcare regulatory agencies encourage its adoption, they do not view adoption of the AdvaMed Code as proof of compliance with applicable laws. Key to the underlying principles of the AdvaMed Code is the need to focus the relationships between manufacturers and healthcare professionals on matters of training, education and scientific research, and limit payments between manufacturers and healthcare professionals to fair market value for legitimate services provided and payment of modest meal, travel, and other expenses for a healthcare professional under limited circumstances. Axogen has incorporated these principles into its relationships with healthcare professionals under its consulting agreements, payment of travel and lodging expenses, research and educational grant procedures and sponsorship of third-party conferences. In addition, Axogen has conducted and will continue to conduct training sessions on these principles. Finally, the Sunshine Act, as defined below, imposes additional reporting and disclosure requirements on Axogen for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as reporting of certain physician ownership interests. Axogen cannot provide any assurance that regulatory or enforcement authorities will view its relationships with physicians or policies as being in compliance with applicable regulations and laws.

Regulation Outside of the U.S.
Distribution and sales of medical products outside of the U.S. are subject to foreign governmental regulations that vary substantially from country to country. 
There are restrictions under U.S. law on the export of medical devices and biological products that cannot be legally distributed in the U.S. The FDA has set forth certain requirements for the export of devices outside of the U.S. depending on the class of device and its FDA approval. Axogen currently believes it complies with applicable regulations when exporting its products and Axogen intends to continue such compliance in the event there are any regulatory changes regarding its products in the U.S.
The primary regulatory body in Europe is the E.U. which has adopted numerous directives and promulgated voluntary standards regulating the design, manufacture and labeling of, and clinical trials and adverse event reporting for, medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear CE marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and can be commercially distributed throughout the member states of the E.U. and other countries that comply with these directives. The method for assessing conformity varies depending on the type and class of the device, but normally involves an assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a notified body, an independent and neutral institution appointed by a country to conduct the conformity assessment. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s device. Such an assessment is required for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout these countries. In the second quarter of 2014, Axogen’s Quality System became registered to ISO 13485 for Receipt, Handling, Storage and Distribution of Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector and Axogen will maintain the registration through 2023.
Cook Biotech is responsible for all regulatory filings for the Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector products, including international registrations. Axogen provides the countries for Cook Biotech to register with, and Cook Biotech prepares and submits the product filing documentation to the Ministry of Health (“MOH”) for the country. Each country or region has its own regulations and the documentation required for submission varies. It typically takes less than nine months from the initiation of the project to obtain clearance in a given country or region. To date, the Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector product lines were registered in May 2013 in Canada for distribution and in April 2013 the product lines were awarded the CE Mark allowing distribution into the E.U. and other countries that accept the CE Mark. Cook Biotech received the renewal of the CE Mark for Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector in May 2021.
In addition, the new European Medical Device Regulation (“E.U. MDR”) passed in the European Parliament on April 5, 2017 and went into effect on May 25, 2017. The E.U. MDR is an extensive reform of the rules governing the medical device industry in Europe. Under this regulation, manufacturers had through May 2021 to comply with a broad set of new rules for almost every kind of medical device. The E.U. MDR requires changes in the clinical evidence required for medical devices, post-market clinical follow-up evidence, annual reporting of safety information for Class III products, and bi-annual reporting for Class II products, Unique Device Identification (“UDI”) for all products, submission of core data elements to a European UDI database prior to placement of a device on the market, reclassification of medical devices, and multiple other labeling changes.
Overall, medical device companies can expect longer lead times to obtain product registrations (i.e., CE Mark Certification) in the E.U. and a substantially costlier pathway to compliance in the E.U. We are not yet able to determine the costs of complying with these regulations, how the E.U. will interpret and enforce them, what the timelines for approvals of products will be and the overall effect of the E.U. MDR on the marketplace. Given the significant additional pre-market and post-market requirements imposed by the E.U. MDR, the overall impact of these new rules could have a material, adverse effect on the Company’s revenue and expenses.
The UK left the E.U. in January 2020. Axogen registers its human tissue products in each individual E.U. country and each distributor in the UK has import authority for Axogen’s human tissue product. It is expected that licensed UK establishments that import or export tissues or cells will need written agreements with the relevant E.U. licensed establishments to continue importing and exporting with the E.U. As Axogen ships directly to the UK from the U.S., we expect no delays in shipment of human tissue products into the UK in 2021. Further, the RANGER clinical trial being performed at select hospitals in the UK was not affected by Brexit (defined below in "Risk Factors - Regulation Outside of the U.S.") as long as the products continue to come directly from the U.S. Beginning in January 2021, new changes became effective as the transition period for the UK’s exit from the E.U. ended. Specifically, all medical devices placed into the UK market had to be registered, subject to applicable grace periods, with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ("MHRA"), will need to appoint a UK Responsible Person, and comply with additional product marking and conformity assessment requirements. Medical devices 
Table of Contents

must be registered with the MHRA if they are being placed in the UK market after May 1, 2021. Cook Biotech is responsible for appointing the UK Responsible Person and registering Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector in the UK.
Tissue products are not currently regulated under the CE Mark
Axogen is responsible for all regulatory filings for Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane (which we have voluntarily suspended from the market). To obtain international approvals, Axogen will prepare the product filing documentation and submit this documentation to the MOH for a country.
Although some standards of harmonization exist, each country in which Axogen conducts business has its own specific regulatory requirements, which are dynamic in nature and continually changing. Axogen procures and processes its tissue for the Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane in the U.S. and markets the Avance Nerve Graft in Canada, the UK, and certain other countries under compliance with the individual country regulations. Axogen conducts a regulatory review at the time of submission of the product dossier. This involves reviewing the appropriate MOH regulations, discussion with in-country distributors and use of consultants. It typically takes less than nine months from the initiation of the product to develop a product dossier (specific for that country), submission of the documentation and MOH review of the product filing. While Axogen believes that it is in compliance with all existing pertinent international and domestic laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that changes in governmental administrations and regulations will not negatively impact Axogen’s operations. Avive Soft Tissue Membrane has received regulatory registration allowing for distribution in Canada, UK, and Austria.
The FDA and international regulatory bodies conduct periodic compliance inspections of Axogen’s U.S. processing facilities. All of Axogen’s locations are properly registered with CBER as tissue establishments. Axogen is also accredited by the AATB and is licensed in the states of Florida, New York, California, Maryland, Delaware, Oregon, and Illinois. Axogen believes that worldwide regulation of tissue products is likely to intensify as the international regulatory community focuses on the growing demand for these implant products and the attendant safety and efficacy issues of recipients. Changes in governing laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on Axogen’s financial condition and results of operations. Axogen management further believes that it can help to mitigate this exposure by continuing to work closely with government and industry regulators.
Environmental
Axogen’s products, as well as the chemicals used in processing these products, are handled and disposed of in accordance with country-specific, federal, state, and local environmental regulations. Since 2007, Axogen has used outside third parties to perform all biohazard waste disposal.
Axogen contracts with independent, third parties to perform sterilization of its allografts. Because of the engagement of a third party to perform irradiation services, the requirements for compliance with radiation hazardous waste do not apply, and therefore Axogen does not anticipate that this engagement will have any material adverse effect upon its capital expenditures, results of operations or financial condition. However, Axogen is responsible for assuring that the service is performed in accordance with applicable regulations. Although Axogen believes it is in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations, the failure to fully comply with any such regulations could result in the imposition of penalties, fines or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on Axogen’s business.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 451 total employees, including approximately 23 part-time employees and 428 full-time employees. Of these employees, 228 work in sales and marketing, 79 work in corporate, 65 work in research and development and 56 work in operations. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K we have not had a work stoppage and no employees are represented by a labor union. We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory. We encourage our employees to be effective stewards of the gift of human tissue. We believe in creating and maintaining a culture that encourages and rewards honesty, openness, and passionate debate among its employees, respect is the foundation for communication and action, and patient safety is our first priority. In response to COVID-19, our top priority has been the health and safety of those we serve, including healthcare professionals and their patients, as well as our employees, communities, and suppliers.
The Compensation Committee of our board of directors (the "Board of Directors") has oversight of our culture and human capital management, including diversity, equity, and inclusion with respect to our employees.
