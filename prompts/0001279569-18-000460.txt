ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
ITH is a mineral exploration company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. The Company currently holds or has the right to acquire interests in an advanced stage exploration project in Alaska referred to as the “Livengood Gold Project” or the “Project”. The Company is in the process of optimizing the Livengood Gold Project as discussed below. The Company has not yet begun preparation for the extraction of mineralization from the deposit or reached commercial production. The Company controls 100% of the Livengood Gold Project, which has a current (as at August 26, 2016) mineral resource of 497 million measured tonnes at an average grade of 0.68 g/tonne (10.84 million ounces), 28 million indicated tonnes at an average grade of 0.69 g/tonne (0.62 million ounces) and 53 million inferred tonnes at an average grade of 0.66 g/tonne (1.1 million ounces). In 2017 the Company issued the results of a pre-feasibility study that was summarized in the April 2017 Report which converted a portion of the mineral resources at the Project into proven reserves of 378 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.71 g/tonne (8.62 million ounces) and probable reserves of 14 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.72 g/tonne (353,000 ounces) based on a gold price of $1,250 per ounce. All work presently planned by the Company is directed at maintaining necessary environmental baseline activities at the Livengood Gold Project and focusing efforts on Project optimization opportunities, including those identified in the April 2017 Report. A more complete description of the Livengood Gold Project and the current activities is set forth in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Since 2006, the Company has focused primarily on the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties in Alaska and Nevada by acquiring through staking, purchase, lease or option (primarily from AngloGold Ashanti (U.S.A.) Exploration Inc. (“AngloGold”) in a transaction which closed on August 4, 2006) interests in a number of mineral properties in Alaska (Livengood Gold Project, Terra, LMS, BMP, Chisna, Coffee Dome, West Tanana, Gilles, West Pogo, Caribou, Blackshell and South Estelle) and Nevada (North Bullfrog and Painted Hills) that it believed had the potential to host large precious or base metal deposits. Some of these, such as the Painted Hills, Gilles, West Tanana, Caribou and Blackshell properties, were, in light of disappointing exploration results, dropped or returned to the respective optionors or lessors, and the associated costs written off while others, such as the South Estelle property, have been sold. Since early 2008, the Company’s primary focus has been the exploration and advancement of the Livengood Gold Project and the majority of its resources have been directed to that end. In August 2010, ITH undertook a corporate spin-out arrangement transaction whereby all of its mineral property interests other than the Project were transferred to Corvus and Corvus was spun out as an independent and separate public company. Following the completion of that transaction, the sole mineral property held by the Company is the Livengood Gold Project. Since the completion of such transaction, the Company has focused exclusively on the ongoing exploration and potential development of the Livengood Gold Project.
 
The head office and principal executive address of ITH is located at Suite 2300 – 1177 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6E 2K3, and its registered and records office is located at 1300 – 777 Dunsmuir Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada  V7Y 1K2.
 
2017
 
Livengood Gold Project Developments
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017 and to the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company progressed on a number of opportunities with the potential for optimization and reducing the costs of building and operating a mine at the Project. Outside consultants were retained to conduct additional metallurgical tests and engineering, including confirmation of the flow sheet and optimizing the operating costs. These inputs were used to evaluate several scenarios, ultimately selecting a project that would process 52,600 tons per day and produce 6.8 million ounces of gold over 23 years. This improved configuration would reduce the capital costs (“CAPEX”) by 34% or $950 million to $1.84 billion, the process operating cost (“process OPEX”) by 28% or $2.97 per ton to $7.48 per ton, and the all-in costs to $1,247 per ounce, all as compared to the 100,000 tons per day project evaluated in the September 2013 Feasibility Study.

Livengood Gold Project – NI 43-101 Report of 2016 Pre-feasibility Study Results
 
The Company announced the results of a Pre-feasibility Study (“2016 PFS”) on September 8, 2016. On October 24, 2016, the Company filed a technical report on SEDAR entitled “NI 43-101 Technical Report Pre-feasibility Study of the Livengood Gold Project, Livengood, Alaska, USA” dated October 24, 2016 (“October Report”) that summarized the results of the 2016 PFS on the Livengood Gold Project.
 
During the first quarter of 2017, it was determined that the calculation of All-In Sustaining Costs for the Livengood Project (“AISC”), as contained in Table 22-2 on page 22-7 of the October Report, was incorrect as it included, contrary to World Gold Council guidance, both initial capital costs and mining and income taxes in the AISC calculation. The Company issued a news release on March 8, 2017 advising that as a result of the restatement, the AISC for the Livengood Gold Project located near Fairbanks, Alaska, is projected to be $976/oz. Subsequently, on April 10, 2017, the Company filed an updated technical report on SEDAR entitled “NI 43-101 Technical Report Pre-feasibility Study of the Livengood Gold Project, Livengood, Alaska, USA” dated March 8, 2017 and signed April 10, 2017 (“April Report”) reflecting the following changes:
 

1. | The AISC calculation has been corrected to be in accordance with World Gold Council guidance, and a corrected Table 22-2 has been included. The corrected AISC number has also been included in Table 1-11 on page 1-25. Where appropriate, text changes have been made to reflect the correct numbers now shown in the tables.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | On January 12, 2017, the Company paid $14.7 million for the timely and full satisfaction of the final derivative payment due with respect to the acquisition of certain mining claims and related rights in the vicinity of the Livengood Project and the Company is now in full ownership and has no further liability with respect to this acquisition. The disclosure regarding the Livengood Property Description and Location in section 4.1.7, pages 4-5 and 4-6, has been updated accordingly.

Management Changes
 
On January 23, 2017, the ITH Board approved a management transition plan, which was implemented on January 31, 2017, in which Karl Hanneman, previously the Chief Operating Officer (COO), became the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), managing both the CEO and COO responsibilities, and Thomas Irwin, the previous CEO, transitioned into a part-time position of Senior Advisor prior to his being considered for nomination to the Board at the Company’s May 2017 Annual General Meeting (AGM). On May 24, 2017, the shareholders elected Mr. Irwin as a director of the Company Board.
Director Changes
 
At the 2017 Annual General Meeting of shareholders in Vancouver, B.C. on May 24, 2017, the shareholders fixed the size of the board at eight with the addition of Mr. Victor Flores and Mr. Thomas Irwin. On November 6, 2017, General Mark Hamilton resigned as director to pursue other opportunities. The Board appointed Stuart Harshaw to the Board effective April 1, 2018, to fill the vacancy that resulted from General Hamilton’s resignation.
Deferred Share Unit Incentive Plan
 
On April 4, 2017, the Company adopted a Deferred Share Unit Plan (the “DSU Plan”). On May 24, 2017, at the Company’s Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, the DSU Plan was approved.

The purpose of the DSU Plan is to allow the Company to grant deferred share units (“DSUs”), each of which is a unit that is equivalent in value to a Common Share, to directors, officers and employees of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company (“Eligible Persons”) in recognition of their contributions and to provide for an incentive for their continuing relationship with the Company. The granting of such DSUs is intended to promote a greater alignment of the interests of Eligible Persons with the interests of shareholders.
 
Other Developments
 
On January 12, 2017, the Company paid $14.7 million for the timely and full satisfaction of the final derivative payment due with respect to acquisition of certain mining claims and related rights in the vicinity of the Livengood Gold Project. On January 17, 2017, the Full Deed of Reconveyance releasing the Deed of Trust on the acquired property was recorded and the Company now fully owns this property and has no further liability with respect to this acquisition.
 
In connection with the Company’s $22.0 million private placement completed on December 28, 2016, the TSX commenced a de-listing review with respect to the Company. On April 7, 2017, the TSX issued a bulletin confirming that it had completed its review and that the Company continued to meet its listing requirements.
 
2018
 
Financing
 
On March 13, 2018, the Company completed a non-brokered private placement pursuant to which it issued 24,000,000 common shares at $0.50 per share for gross proceeds of $12.0 million. The Company intends to use the funds for continuation of optimization studies to further improve and de-risk the Project, required environmental baseline studies, and for general working capital purposes.
Outlook
 
On March 12, 2018 the Board approved a 2018 budget of $5.1 million. The work program incorporated in this budget will build upon the metallurgical studies undertaken in 2017 to continue to define and refine the project flowsheet. Using the improved mineralization and alteration models now available for the Livengood gold deposit arising from the work completed in 2017, 4000 kg of metallurgical composites have been selected and shipped to SGS Vancouver. These samples will be processed in 2018 to determine whether different recovery parameters should be applied to different areas of the orebody. The engineering firm of BBA Inc. (BBA) will be retained to continue to guide the metallurgical program. Work is also planned to advance the environmental baseline efforts needed to support future permitting.
 
On March 12, 2018, the Board also approved recommendations by management to further reduce corporate overhead costs, including a reduction in CEO salary by 50% (reflecting an approximate 50% reduction in the amount of time he will spend working on the Project), a reduction in board cash compensation and expense, and staff reductions as appropriate as critical work is completed. Depending upon the level of technical work or permitting efforts underway in future years, these cost savings should bring total project G&A costs into the range of $2.5 million per year.
 
The Company remains open to a strategic alliance to help support the future development of the Project while considering all other appropriate financing options. The size of the gold resource, the favorable location, and the proven team are some of the reasons the Company would potentially attract a strategic partner with a long term development horizon who understands the Project is highly leveraged to gold prices.
 
Regulatory, Environmental and Social Matters
 
All of the Company’s currently proposed exploration is under the jurisdiction of the State of Alaska. In Alaska, low impact, initial stage surface exploration such as stream sediment, soil and rock chip sampling does not require any permits. The State of Alaska requires an APMA (Alaska Placer Mining Application) exploration permit for all substantial surface disturbances such as trenching, road building and drilling. These permits are also reviewed by related state and federal agencies that can comment and require specific changes to the proposed work plans to minimize impacts on the environment. The permitting process for significant disturbances generally requires 30 days for processing and all work must be bonded. The Company currently has all necessary permits with respect to its currently planned exploration activities in Alaska. Although the Company has never had an issue with the timely processing of APMA permits, there can be no assurances that delays in permit approval will not occur.

ITH has created a Technical Committee, which has adopted a formal, written charter. As set out in its charter, the overall purpose of the Technical Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the Company’s continuing commitment to improving the environment and ensuring that activities are carried out and facilities are operated and maintained in a safe and environmentally sound manner that reflects the ideals and principles of sustainable development. The primary function of the Technical Committee is to monitor, review and provide oversight with respect to the technical aspects of the Company’s projects as well as monitor policies, standards, accountabilities and programs relative to health, safety, community relations and environmental-related matters. The Technical Committee also advises the Board and makes recommendations for the Board’s consideration regarding health, safety, community relations and environmental-related issues.
 
Although not set out in a specific policy, the Company strives to be a positive influence in the local communities where its mineral projects are located, not only by contributing to the welfare of such communities through donations of money and supplies, as appropriate, but also through hiring, when appropriate, local workers to assist in ongoing exploration programs. The Company considers building and maintaining strong relationships with such communities to be fundamental to its ability to continue to operate in such regions and to assist in the eventual development (if any) of mining operations in such regions, and it attaches considerable importance to commencing and fostering such relationships from the beginning of its involvement in any particular area.
 
Corporate Structure
 
ITH was incorporated under the Company Act (British Columbia) under the name “Ashnola Mining Company Ltd.” on May 26, 1978. ITH’s name was changed to “Tower Hill Mines Ltd.” on June 1, 1988, and subsequently changed to “International Tower Hill Mines Ltd.” on March 15, 1991. ITH has been transitioned under, and is now governed by, the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). On November 15, 2005, the shareholders resolved to amend the Company’s Articles to increase its authorized capital from 20,000,000 common shares without par value to 500,000,000 common shares without par value. This increase became effective on April 20, 2006.
 
ITH has three material subsidiaries:
 

· | Tower Hill Mines, Inc. (“TH Alaska”), a corporation incorporated in Alaska on June 27, 2006, which holds most of the Company’s Alaskan mineral properties and is 100% owned by ITH;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Tower Hill Mines (US) LLC, a limited liability company formed in Colorado on June 27, 2006, which carries on the Company’s administrative and personnel functions and is wholly owned by TH Alaska; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Livengood Placers, Inc., a corporation incorporated in Nevada on June 11, 1998, which holds certain Alaskan properties and is 100% owned by TH Alaska.

Competition
 
ITH is an exploration stage company. The Company competes with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing, technical expertise and the acquisition of mineral properties. Many of the companies with whom the Company competes have greater financial and technical resources. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. This competition could adversely impact the Company’s ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for the Company to develop its mineral properties.
Availability of Raw Materials and Skilled Employees
 
All aspects of the Company’s business require specialized skills and knowledge. Such skills and knowledge include the areas of geology, drilling, logistical planning, preparation of feasibility studies, permitting, construction and operation of a mine, financing and accounting. Since commencing its current operations in mid-2006, the Company has found and retained appropriate employees and consultants and believes it will continue to be able to do so.
 
All of the raw materials the Company requires to carry on its business are readily available through normal supply or business contracting channels in Canada and the United States. Since commencing exploration activities at the Livengood Gold Project in mid-2006, the Company has been able to secure the appropriate personnel, equipment and supplies required to conduct its contemplated programs. While it has experienced difficulty in procuring some equipment, such as drill equipment or services, experienced drillers and timely assay laboratory services in previous years, the recent overall slowdown in the mineral exploration business has resulted in more equipment and services being made available on a timely basis. As a result, the Company does not believe that it will experience any shortages of required personnel, equipment or supplies in the foreseeable future.
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2017, the Company had 7 full-time employees. The Company also uses consultants with specific skills to assist with various aspects of project evaluation, engineering and corporate governance.
Seasonality
 
As the Company’s mineral exploration activity takes place in Alaska, its business is seasonal. Due to the northern climate, exploration work on the Livengood Gold Project can be limited due to excessive snow cover and cold temperatures. In general, surface sampling work is limited to May through September and surface drilling from March through November, although some locations afford opportunities for year-round exploration operations and others, such as road-accessible wetland areas, may only be explored while frozen in the winter.
