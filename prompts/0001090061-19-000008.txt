International Operations
Net sales from our foreign operations were $320.2 million in 2018, $301.4 million in 2017, and $305.9 million in 2016. These net sales represented 41.6% of our total net sales in 2018, 38.5% in 2017, and 40.3% in 2016. Long-lived assets primarily consist of net property, plant, and equipment. Long-lived assets of our foreign operations totaled $90.1 million at November 30, 2018, $84.2 million at November 30, 2017, and $77.4 million at November 30, 2016. Our consolidated long-lived assets totaled $205.8 million at November 30, 2018, $208.9 million at November 30, 2017, and $202.7 million at November 30, 2016.
Intellectual Property
We regard patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property as important to our success, and we rely on them globally to protect our investments in products and technology. Our patents expire at various times, but we believe that the loss or expiration of any individual patent would not materially affect our business. We, like other companies in the industries in which we operate, may be subject to claims of alleged infringement of the patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights of third parties from time to time.
Seasonal Factors
We historically experience stronger sales and income in our second, third, and fourth quarters, comprised of the three-month periods ending May 31, August 31, and November 30. Our performance in the first quarter (December through February) has historically been affected by generally lower levels of customer manufacturing, construction, and refurbishment activities during the holidays and cold weather months.
Environmental Matters
Our business operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations not only affect our current operations, but also could impose liability on us for past operations that were conducted in compliance with then applicable laws and regulations. For further discussion of capital and noncapital expenditures for environmental compliance, please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Environmental Matters” of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Employees
As of November 30, 2018, the Company employed approximately 1,900 employees globally. Approximately 11% of the Company’s U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. of which approximately 140 employees are covered by agreements that expire within the next 12 months. In addition, certain of our foreign employees are also covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Raw Materials
We utilize a variety of raw materials, primarily monomers, in the manufacture of our products. Most of these raw materials have been, and we expect will continue to be, generally available from multiple suppliers. Monomer costs, which are a major component of the polymers-based products, include butadiene, styrene, acrylates, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate and vinyl pyridine, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins, textiles, plasticizers, paper, and titanium dioxide.
The cost of raw materials has a significant impact on our profitability. We generally attempt to respond to raw material cost increases through productivity programs and price increases to our customers. The success of attempted price increases depends on a variety of factors including the specific market application and competitive environment. Under certain circumstances, we are not able to pass along some or all of the increase. In addition, if accepted by customers, price increases generally lag the increase in raw material costs. Index pricing applies to approximately 25% of our total net sales.
Research and Development
OMNOVA Solutions' technology and design centers support research and development efforts across our businesses and complement the resources focused on innovation in both of our segments. Our efforts are focused on developing new applications with our base technologies and enhancing the functionality of our products in existing applications, as well as developing new product and technology platforms.
Research and development costs were $17.7 million in 2018, $18.9 million in 2017, and $20.8 million in 2016. Our research and development costs relating to new products were $6.1 million in 2018, $7.5 million in 2017, and $8.2 million in 2016. Research and development expenses include the costs of technical activities that are critical to developing new products, services, processes or techniques, as well as those expenses for technical activities that may improve existing products or processes. Information relating to research and development expense is set forth in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this report.
