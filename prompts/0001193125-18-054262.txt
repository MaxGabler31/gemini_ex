When used in this report, the words intend, anticipate, believe, estimate, plan and expect and similar expressions as they relate to us are included to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements and are a result of certain factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
References throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K to Repligen, we, us, our, or the Company refer to Repligen Corporation and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, unless the context otherwise indicates. 
 Overview 
 Repligen is a leading provider of advanced bioprocessing technology and solutions used in the process of manufacturing biologic drugs. Our products are made to substantially increase biopharmaceutical manufacturing efficiencies and flexibility. As the global biologics market continues to experience strong growth and expansion, our customers  primarily large biopharmaceutical companies and contract manufacturing organizations  face critical production cost, capacity, quality and time pressures that our products are made to address. Our commitment to bioprocessing is helping to set new standards for the way our customers manufacture biologic drugs  monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, vaccines and gene therapies. We are dedicated to inspiring advances in bioprocessing as a trusted partner in the production of biologic drugs that improve human health worldwide. 
 We currently operate as one bioprocessing business, with a comprehensive suite of products to serve both upstream and downstream processes in biologic drug manufacturing. Building on over 35 years of industry expertise, we have developed a broad and diversified product portfolio that reflects our commitment to build a best-in-class bioprocessing technology company with a world-class direct sales and commercial organization. 
 We are committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities and maximizing the value of our product platform through both organic growth initiatives (internal innovation and commercial leverage) and targeted acquisitions. 
 History 
 Prior to 2012, the Company was focused on drug development, with clinical trial costs supported by bioprocessing product sales. At that time our bioprocessing business was largely represented by sales of Protein A ligands, which we sell through long term OEM supply agreements. Our 2011 acquisition of Novozymes Biopharma Sweden AB (the Novozymes Acquisition) further expanded our proteins product portfolio and provided impetus to set a new direction for the company. By mid-2012, we permanently discontinued and have since divested all drug development programs. We retained our proteins OEM business and, through internal innovation and strategic acquisitions, we have built chromatography and filtration product offerings that we sell direct to biologics manufacturers. We continue to seek out strategic opportunities to strengthen and expand our bioprocessing business. 
Our Products 
 OEM Products (Proteins) 
 Our OEM products are represented by our Protein A ligands and cell culture growth factor products. 
 Protein A 
 We are a leading provider of Protein A ligands to life sciences companies. Protein A ligands are an essential binding component of Protein A chromatography resins used in the purification of virtually all monoclonal 
 
2 
 
 antibody (mAb) based drugs on the market or in development. We manufacture multiple forms of Protein A ligands under long-term supply agreements with major life sciences companies including GE Healthcare and MilliporeSigma, who in turn sell their Protein A chromatography resins to end users (mAb manufacturers). We have two manufacturing sites supporting overall global demand for our Protein A ligands: one in Lund, Sweden and another in Waltham, MA. 
 Protein A chromatography resins are considered the industry standard for purification of antibody-based therapeutics due to the ability of the Protein A ligand to selectively bind to or capture antibodies from crude protein mixtures. Protein A resins are packed into the first chromatography column of typically three columns used in a mAb purification process. As a result of Protein As high affinity for antibodies, the mAb product is highly purified and concentrated within this first capture step before moving to polishing steps. 
 Growth Factors 
 Most biopharmaceuticals are produced through an upstream mammalian cell fermentation process. In order to stimulate increase cell growth and maximize overall yield from a bioreactor, manufacturers often add growth factors, such as insulin, to their cell culture fermentation media. As part of the Novozymes Acquisition in 2011, we gained several cell culture growth factor additives. Among those products is LONG®R3 IGF-1, our insulin-like growth factor that has been shown to be up to 100 times more biologically potent than insulin (the industry standard), thereby increasing recombinant protein production in cell culture fermentation applications. LONG R3 IGF-1 is sold through a distribution partnership with MilliporeSigma. 
 Direct-to-Customer Products (Chromatography and Filtration) 
 Since 2012, we have significantly expanded our direct-to-customer presence through our Chromatography and Filtration franchises, which include highly differentiated, market-leading products and systems. We have diversified and grown our direct-to-customer product offering through internal innovation and through disciplined, accretive acquisitions of assets or businesses that leverage existing product lines and/or expand our customer and geographic scope. 
 To support our sales goals for our direct-to-consumer products, we have invested in our commercial organization, expanding from 3 field employees in 2014 to 54 field employees currently, which include sales reps, field applications specialists and field service personnel. In addition, to meet increased demand for our products, we continue to invest in increasing the volume and scale of manufacturing at our facilities in the United States, Sweden and Germany. 
 Chromatography 
 Our Chromatography franchise includes a number of products used in the downstream purification and quality control of biological drugs. The main driver of growth in this portfolio is our process-scale OPUS pre-packed chromatography (PPC) column line. 
 Our other products include chromatography resins (such as CaptivA®) used in a small number of commercial drug processes and ELISA test kits used by quality control departments to detect and measure the presence of leached Protein A and/or growth factor in the final product. 
 OPUS 
 Our Chromatography franchise features pre-packed chromatography columns under our OPUS brand. OPUS columns, which we deliver to our customers pre-packed with their choice of chromatography resin, are single-campaign (single-use) disposable columns that replace the use of traditional and more permanent glass columns used in downstream purification processes. By designing OPUS to be the most technologically 
 
3 
 
 advanced and most flexible option for the purification of biologics from process development through clinical-scale and some commercial manufacturing, Repligen has become a leader in the pre-packed column market. The customization and ready-to-use nature of our OPUS columns makes them ideal for purification of antibodies and recombinant proteins. Biomanufacturers value the time savings, labor and utility cost savings, product consistency and the plug and play convenience of OPUS. 
 We launched our first production-scale OPUS columns in 2012, and have since added larger diameter options such as OPUS 45 and OPUS 60. We have also introduced next-generation features such as a resin recovery port on our larger columns. This allows our customers to reuse the recovered resin in other applications. The unpacking port feature was made available in the first quarter of 2017 on our largest production-scale OPUS columns. 
 Through our acquisition of Atoll GmbH in 2016, we established a customer-facing center in Europe and expanded our portfolio to include our smaller-scale columns, named OPUS PD, that are used in high throughput process development screening, viral validation studies and scale down validation of chromatography processes. We maintain a broad and customizable pre-packed column product line to meet our customers diverse needs. 
 Other Chromatography 
 Also included in our Chromatography portfolio are ELISA kits, which are analytical test kits to detect the presence of proteins and growth factors, and chromatography resins, including our CaptivA® brand. In addition, following our acquisition of Spectrum in 2017, we sell Spectra/Chrom® liquid chromatography products as part of our chromatography product line. 
 Filtration 
 XCell ATF 
 Our Filtration products offer a number of advantages to manufacturers of biologic drugs at volumes that span from pilot studies to clinical and commercial-scale production. We first established our Filtration franchise through our acquisition of XCell Alternating Tangential Flow (ATF) assets from Refine Technology (Refine) in 2014. XCell ATF systems are used primarily in upstream perfusion, or continuous manufacturing, processes. 
 XCell ATF is a technologically advanced filtration device used in upstream processes to continuously remove cellular metabolic waste products during the course of a fermentation run, freeing healthy cells to continue producing the biologic drug of interest. XCell ATF was designed to both increase the density of cells in a bioreactor and extend the production run. By continuously removing waste products from the fermenter, the XCell ATF System routinely increases cell densities to 2- or 3-times the levels achieved by standard batch fermentation. As a result, product yield is increased, which improves facility utilization and can reduce the size of a bioreactor required to manufacture a given volume of biologic drug product. This is important to biomanufacturers who seek to maximize output from their existing facilities. XCell ATF Systems are suitable for use in laboratory and scale-up all the way to production bioreactors as large as 2,000 liters. 
 Through internal innovation, we developed and in 2016 launched single-use formats of the original stainless steel XCell ATF device to address increasing industry demand for plug-and-play technology. The XCell ATF device is now available to customers in both its original configuration (steel housing and replaceable filters) in all sizes (2, 4, 6 and 10), and/or as a single-use device (disposable housing/filter combination) in most sizes (2, 6, and 10). The availability of XCell ATF in a single-use format eliminates the pre-use workflow associated with autoclaving, leading to an 80% reduction in implementation time. The single-use format also enables our customers to accelerate evaluations of the product with a lower initial overall cost of ownership. Based on strong demand, we have continued to expand the single-use XCell ATF offering.

Sius TFF (TangenX) 
 In December 2016, we acquired TangenX Technology Corporation (TangenX), balancing our upstream XCell ATF offering with a downstream portfolio of flat-sheet tangential flow filters (TFF) and cassettes used in downstream biologic drug purification and formulation processes. The TangenX portfolio includes our single-use Sius TFF brand, providing customers with a high-performance, low-cost alternative to reusable TFF cassettes. 
 TFF is a rapid and efficient method for separation and purification of biomolecules that is widely used in laboratory, process development and process scale applications in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Sius is an innovative single-use TFF line of cassettes and hardware for lab-scale through large-scale biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Single-use Sius TFF cassettes with enclosed flat sheet membranes are designed to provide a high performing membrane at significantly lower product and labor costs than reusable TFF products. Each disposable cassette is delivered pre-sanitized, integrity tested and ready to be equilibrated and used for tangential flow diafiltration and ultrafiltration processing. Use of Sius TFF cassettes eliminates non-value added steps of cleaning and flushing required in reusable TFF products. The cassettes are interchangeable with filter hardware from multiple manufacturers, simplifying customer trial and adoption of Sius products. 
 KrosFlo®, ProConnex® (Spectrum) 
 We acquired Spectrum and its subsidiaries in August 2017 to strengthen our filtration business with the addition of a leading portfolio of hollow-fiber (HF) filters and modules, single-use flow path connectors and TFF filtration systems. Spectrum products are used in bench-top through commercial-scale processes, primarily for the filtration, isolation, purification and concentration of biologics and diagnostic products. Our Spectrum filtration products offer both standard and customized solutions to bioprocessing customers, with particular strength in consumable and single-use offerings. 
 With the addition of Spectrum, we now in-house manufacture hollow-fiber filters that can be used in our XCell ATF system. In addition, we increased our direct sales presence in Europe and Asia, and we diversified our end markets beyond monoclonal antibodies to include vaccines, recombinant protein and gene therapies. 
 Spectrums filtration brands include its KrosFlo® line of hollow-fiber cartridges and TFF systems, its Spectra/Por® portfolio of laboratory and process dialysis products and its Pro-Connex® single-use hollow-fiber Module-Bag-Tubing sets. 
 Corporate Information 
 We are a Delaware corporation with global headquarters in Waltham, Massachusetts. We were incorporated in 1981 and became a publicly traded company in 1986. Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol RGEN. We have over 470 employees and operate globally with offices and manufacturing sites located at multiple locations in the United States, Europe and Asia. Our principal executive offices are located at 41 Seyon Street, Waltham, Massachusetts 02453, our website is www.repligen.com and our telephone number is (781) 250-0111.Our Market Opportunity 
 The global biologics drug market is estimated to be over $200 billion. This market includes therapeutic antibodies, recombinant proteins and vaccines. Antibody-based biologics alone accounted for over $100 billion of global biopharma revenue and represented a majority of the top 10 best-selling drugs across the pharmaceutical industry in 2016. Industry sources project the biologics market to grow at a rate of 8%-10% annually over the next five years, driven by strength in the monoclonal antibody (mAb) class of biologics, as evidenced by the rate of new approvals, expanded labels for marketed antibodies and the emergence of biosimilar versions of originator mAbs. 
 

5 
 
In 2017, a record 14 antibodies (10 originator and four biosimilar antibodies) were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat a diverse range of diseases. There are currently more than 80 mAbs on the market and more than 400 in various stages of clinical development addressing a wide range of medical conditions including asthma, migraines and Alzheimers disease. 
 In addition to investments in the discovery and development of novel biologic drugs, there has been substantial investment in follow-on products (biosimilars) by generic and specialty pharmaceutical as well as large biopharmaceutical companies. Development of follow-on products has accelerated as the first major mAbs have come off patent in the European Union and United States. Due to the high cost of biologic drugs, many countries in the developing and emerging markets have been aggressively investing in biomanufacturing capabilities to supply lower cost biosimilars for the local markets. For both originator and follow-on biologics manufacturing, Repligen products are well-positioned to enable greater manufacturing flexibility, production yields and lower costs through improved process efficiencies. 
 The Biologics Manufacturing Process 
 Manufacturing biologic drugs requires three fundamental steps. First, upstream manufacturing involves the production of the biologic by living cells that are grown in a bioreactor under controlled conditions. These cells, or factories, are highly sensitive to the conditions under which they grow, including the composition of the cell culture media and the growth factors used to stimulate increased cell growth and protein production, or titre. In the second, downstream step, the biologic must be separated and purified, typically through various filtration and chromatography (purification) steps. In the third stage of the process, the purified biologic drug is formulated, quality controlled and packaged into its final injectable form. 
 Detailed specifications for a drugs manufacturing process are included in the applications that biopharmaceutical companies file for marketing approval with regulators such as the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Once a drug advances to late-stage clinical trials, the commercial manufacturing process is typically established by the developer, and the process specifications become part of the regulatory approval package. As a result, bioprocessing products that are included in these manufacturing specifications can be very sticky due to the costs and regulatory uncertainties associated with displacing them. 
 Our Strategy 
 We are focused on the development, production and commercialization of differentiated bioprocessing technologies and solutions that address pressure points in the inherently complex biologics manufacturing process and deliver substantial value to our customers. We are committed to supporting our customers with strong customer service and applications expertise. 
 We intend to build on our recent history of developing market-leading solutions and delivering strong financial performance through the following strategies: 
 

 | Continued innovation. We plan to capitalize on our internal technological expertise to develop products that address unmet needs in upstream and downstream bioprocessing. We intend to invest further in our core Proteins franchise while developing platform and derivative products to support our Filtration and Chromatography franchises.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Platforming our products. A key strategy for accelerating market adoption of our products is delivery of enabling technologies that become the standard, or platform, technology in markets where we compete. We focus our efforts on winning early-stage technology evaluations through direct interaction with the key biomanufacturing decision makers in process development labs. This strategy is designed to establish both early adoption of our enabling technologies at key accounts and accelerate the implementation of our products as platform products, thereby strengthening our competitive advantage and contributing to long-term growth.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | Targeted acquisitions. We have recently completed strategic acquisitions that strengthen our market position, and we continue to selectively pursue acquisitions and intend to leverage our balance sheet to acquire technologies and products that improve our overall financial performance by improving our competitiveness and/or moving us into adjacent markets with common commercial call points.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Geographical expansion. We will continue to incrementally expand our global commercial team and distribution channels, particularly in the United States, Europe and Asia, to increase our global presence and simplify our interactions and transactions with customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Operational efficiency. In recognition of the increasing size and scale of our organization, we continue to invest in systems to support our global operations in order to optimize resources and productivity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research and Development 
 Our research activities are focused on developing new high-value bioprocessing products. Specifically, we plan to focus these efforts on expanding our product portfolio and applications for our OPUS PPC columns, XCell ATF systems, Sius TFF, KrosFlo®, TFF systems and other products, and developing next generation Protein A ligands. Research and development expenses totaled approximately $8.7 million, $7.4 million and $5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales and marketing strategy supports our objective of strengthening our position as a leading provider of products and services, addressing upstream, downstream and quality control needs of bioprocessing customers in the biopharmaceutical industry. 
 OEM Agreements 
 For our Proteins franchise, we are committed to being a partner of choice for our customers with distributor and supply agreements in place with large life sciences companies such as GE Healthcare, MilliporeSigma and Purolite. The GE Healthcare Protein A supply agreement relating to our Lund, Sweden facility runs, pursuant to its terms, through 2019. The GE Healthcare Protein A supply agreement relating to our Waltham, Massachusetts facility runs, pursuant to its terms, through 2021. Our Protein A supply agreement with MilliporeSigma runs, pursuant to its terms, through 2023, and in 2017 we secured a Protein A supply agreement with Purolite that runs, pursuant to its terms, to November 2022 with an option for renewal through 2025. Our dual manufacturing capability provides strong business continuity and reduces overall supply risk for our OEM customers. 
 Direct-to-Customer Team 
 Supporting our direct-to-customer Chromatography and Filtration franchises, we have invested in our commercial organization, expanding from 3 field employees in 2014 to 54 field employees (field sales, applications and service) in the U.S., Europe and Asia as of February 15, 2018. This includes the team of 26 highly experienced field personnel that we added with our acquisition of Spectrum in 2017. With the acquisition, we have greatly expanded our direct sales team in Asia, where we also work effectively with key distributors to serve our expanding customer base. In addition, we have 41 employees in marketing, product management and customer service support to our expanding customer base. In Asia, we also work effectively with key distributors. 
 As part of the Spectrum integration process, we expect to transition to a hybrid sales model by the end of the first quarter of 2018, whereby all sales staff will represent all Repligen products across our Chromatography and Filtration portfolios. Our bioprocess account managers will be supported in each region by technically trained field applications specialists and field service providers, who can work closely with customers on product demonstrations, implementation and support. We believe that this model will help drive further adoption at our key accounts and also open up new sales opportunities within each region.

MilliporeSigma, our second largest bioprocessing customer, accounted for 18%, 28% and 29% of total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Employees 
 As of February 15, 2018, we had 476 employees. Of those employees, 42 were engaged in engineering and research and development, 289 in manufacturing, 95 in sales and marketing and 50 in administrative functions. Each of our employees has signed a confidentiality agreement. None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have one collective bargaining agreement with two unions that covers our 60 employees in Sweden, comprising approximately 13% of our total workforce. We renewed these collective bargaining agreements during 2017, and the new collective bargaining agreements expire on March 31, 2019. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. 
Patents, Licenses and Proprietary Rights 
 We consider patents to be an important element in the protection of our competitive and proprietary position and actively, and selectively, pursue patent protection in the United States and in major countries abroad. As further described below, we own or have exclusive rights to a number of U.S. patents and U.S. pending patent applications as well as corresponding foreign patents and patent applications. The expiration of key patents owned or licensed by us or the failure of patents to issue on pending patent applications could create increased competition, with potential adverse effects on our business prospects. 
 Other forms of market protection, including trade secrets and know-how, are also considered important elements of our proprietary strategy. Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants, business partners, and major customers to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment, consulting, business relationship, or product related audit with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the other party during the course of the relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and consultants, the agreements generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to Repligen shall be our exclusive property and must be assigned to Repligen.

Protein A 
 We have developed proprietary technology, trade secrets, and know-how relating to the manufacture of recombinant Protein A at a scale and quality standard that is consistent with the requirements of the biopharmaceutical industry. In addition, our U.S. Patent No. 7,691,608, Nucleic Acids Encoding Recombinant Protein A, claims an isolated nucleic acid molecule that encodes a Protein A molecule with an amino acid sequence identical to that of the natural Protein A molecule, which has long been commercialized for bioprocessing applications. This U.S. patent, with the term adjustment that was granted, will remain in effect until June 2028. Foreign equivalents of this patent have been issued in Sweden, Netherlands, Great Britain, France, Germany, and Canada. The claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,691,608 cover compositions of matter including isolated nucleic acids, expression vectors, bacterial cells that include the nucleic acids, as well as methods of producing truncated Protein A polypeptides, methods of producing affinity chromatography resins, and methods of purifying proteins. 
OPUS 
 Since 2012, we filed five provisional patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and four patent applications based on those provisional patent applications, which cover certain unique methods and features of our OPUS pre-packed columns. These unique methods and features include methods of making and loading these chromatography columns as well as the columns themselves; methods of sterilizing plastic chromatography columns; disposable (single use) alternating tangential flow filtration units and methods of manufacture, testing, and use; methods of recovering packing medium from pre-packed chromatography columns and specialized chromatography columns for use in such methods; and methods and systems for removing air from chromatography columns using specialized tubing and valve systems. In addition, we have filed international patent cooperation treaty applications as a utility application with the USPTO on the basis of the provisional applications. Certain of these patent applications related to the OPUS pre-packed column are pending in the United States, Europe, Hong Kong, India, and Japan, and certain related patents have been granted in Australia and Canada. 
 XCell ATF Systems 
 As part of the Refine Acquisition, we acquired the exclusive rights to an issued U.S. patent (US 6,544,424) covering the ATF System and a process related to the filtration of biologic fluids from a bioreactor through hollow fiber filters by the action of a diaphragm pump that creates alternating tangential flow through the filter. The patent expires in 2020. 
 Another patent has been issued in the U.S. covering improvements on the original ATF design that include a screen filter module (U.S. Patent No. 9,050,547). This family of patents and applications has issued or is pending in Brazil, China, Germany, France, Great Britain, India, Korea and Sweden. 
 Other additional improvements on the original ATF systems and methods are covered by patents and patent applications pending in one or more of the U.S., Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Japan, and Korea.

 In August 2017, Repligen acquired Spectrum, including its patent portfolio. Spectrum currently has 2 issued patents and one pending patent application in the United States and 2 pending applications in other countries related to surgical drapes, cell proliferation methods, and thick wall, hollow fiber tangential flow filters.
Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors 
 In 2007, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with The Scripps Research Institute for worldwide rights to a patent application claiming compounds and methods for treating Friedreichs ataxia with inhibitors of histone deacetylase. We extended this original work and filed additional patent applications which claim both methods and compositions for treating Friedreichs ataxia. On January 21, 2014, we out-licensed all of our intellectual property related to HDAC to BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Inc. (BioMarin), and BioMarin has assumed responsibility for maintaining existing intellectual property and prosecuting new intellectual property relating to this program. Our out-licensed HDAC portfolio included patent applications in the United States as well as patent applications in Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia. Patents, if any, that are granted in the U.S. based on these patent applications are expected to expire from 2029 to 2032. 
Trademarks 
 Our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace is dependent in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, which includes protecting the trademarks we use in connection with our products and services. We rely on several registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. Repligen currently has 12 registered trademarks in the United States and 34 registrations in other countries. Repligen continues to file trademark applications and currently has 4 pending applications in the United States and 13 pending applications in other countries. 
 Spectrum currently has 25 registered trademarks in the United States and 2 registrations in other countries. 
 Licensing Agreements 
 HDAC Agreement with BioMarin 
 On January 21, 2014, we out-licensed our HDAC portfolio, which includes the Friedreichs ataxia program, to BioMarin. Friedreichs ataxia is an inherited disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system resulting in symptoms ranging from impaired walking and speech problems to heart disease. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, BioMarin agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize HDAC portfolio products until the later of: (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of an issued and unexpired patent or pending patent application claiming a compound included in the agreement or (ii) 10 years. Under the terms of the agreement, Repligen received an upfront payment of $2 million in January 2014 from BioMarin and we have the potential to receive up to $160 million in future milestone payments for BioMarins development, regulatory approval, and commercial sale of portfolio compounds included in the agreement. 
 These potential milestone payments are approximately 37% related to clinical development and 63% related to initial commercial sales in specific geographies. In addition, Repligen is eligible to receive royalties on sales of qualified products developed. The royalty rates are tiered and begin in the mid-single-digits for the first HDAC portfolio product and for the first non-HDAC portfolio product with lesser amounts for any backup products developed under the agreement. Repligens receipt of these royalties is subject to customary offsets and deductions. There are no refund provisions in this agreement. Royalties under this agreement are paid on a country-by-country basis during the period beginning on the first commercial sale of a compound in such country, until the later of: (i) the expiration of exclusivity period granted by a governmental authority to prevent the entry of generic product into such country; (ii) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of an issued and unexpired patent or pending patent application claiming such compound in such country; or (iii) ten years 
 
10 
 
 following the first commercial sale of such HDAC portfolio product in any country. Royalty payments on products derived from the compounds included in the agreement are calculated by multiplying net sales of such product for the calendar year by an applicable royalty rate based on incremental net sale amounts. We have no further obligations to BioMarin. 
 RG1068 
 Our clinical development portfolio previously included RG1068, a synthetic human hormone we had developed as a novel imaging agent for the improved detection of pancreatic duct abnormalities in combination with magnetic resonance imaging in patients with pancreatitis and potentially other pancreatic diseases. In December 23, 2014, Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (Innovate) acquired our RG1068 program for a nominal amount. Innovate is solely responsible for future development and commercialization of RG1068. If Innovate gains marketing approval and successfully commercializes RG1068, Repligen is eligible to receive royalties through the later of ten years after the first commercial sale or the entry of a generic equivalent into the U.S. market. 
 Competition 
 Our bioprocessing products compete on the basis of quality, performance, cost effectiveness, and application suitability with numerous established technologies. Additional products using new technologies that may be competitive with our products may also be introduced. Many of the companies selling or developing competitive products, which in some cases include GE Healthcare and MilliporeSigma, our two largest customers, have greater financial and human resources, research and development, manufacturing and marketing experience than we do. They may undertake their own development of products that are substantially similar to, or compete with, our products and they may succeed in developing products that are more effective or less costly than any that we may develop. These competitors may also prove to be more successful in their production, marketing and commercialization activities. We cannot be certain that the research, development and commercialization efforts of our competitors will not render any of our existing or potential products obsolete. 
Manufacturing 
 We manufacture seven commercial forms of Protein A, including native Protein A for life sciences companies, including GE Healthcare, MilliporeSigma and Purolite, under long-term supply agreements which expire between 2019 and 2023. Native Protein A is manufactured in Lund, Sweden, while the recombinant forms are manufactured in both Waltham, Massachusetts and Lund, Sweden. We currently manufacture our growth factor products in Lund, Sweden. Our OPUS chromatography columns and XCell ATF System products are manufactured in Waltham, Massachusetts.
