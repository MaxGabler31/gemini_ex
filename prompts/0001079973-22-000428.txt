Item 1.  Description of Business
General
 Teo Foods Inc. ("TEO Foods" or the "Company") produces and sells packaged food and beverage products for retail in the frozen, refrigerated and shelf stable categories. We utilize our production capacities for our own brands and to co-pack for other brands sold domestically and in Mexico. We are also working to commercialize a novel sterilization system for packaged food products that is intended to improve food quality and extended shelf life. We operate from our processing and packaging facilities in Tijuana Mexico.
 Effective January 1, 2019, we completed an acquisition of Commercial Targa S.A. De C.V. ("Targa") which included the NERYS line of imported California cheese products sold in major stores such as Wal-Mart, Soriana, Calimax, Smart & Final, OXXO and others. Effective April 1, 2020, we exchanged certain production equipment and facilities and licensed the Nerys brand for cheese products in Mexico. In exchange we receive a royalty on the NERYS cheese products sold in Mexico, a portion of net revenue from all products and five percent of the proceeds of any sale of the business. Effective January 1, 2021, the Company terminated its operation of Commercial Targa S.A. de C.V. (“Targa”) and disposed of it as a subsidiary.
 The Company created a new subsidiary, BC TEO Foods S.A de C.V., (“BC TEO”) in January 2020, which is operating new facilities where we have moved our processing and packaging equipment. The new facilities have been remodeled for higher productivity and to achieve a high food safety certification in support of access to global markets. The TEO Pasteurizer/Sterilizer was also transferred to the new facilities for final R&D and validation for production.

We have been working to develop business in the new facilities that is diverse from cheese processing. In March of 2022 we became licensed to produce alcoholic beverages in our Tijuana facility.
 Our facility benefits from its close proximity to the California border crossings into San Diego, low labor rates, low commercial lease rates and the ease of manufacturing for export due to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) Trade Agreement. We have reception, conference and administration offices. The combined suites are adjoining with forklift access internally between all 38,000 square feet and truck loading bays.
 We will continue to develop our products for placements in Mexico and export to the USA. We believe that expanding our operations to include alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages will also support the development of trayed meal products for final R&D and validation for production of the TEO Pasteurizer/Sterilizer. This assumes that we are able to secure additional capital to acquire the necessary equipment, supplies and staff.
 
We will maintain a website located at www.teofoods.com, and electronic copies of our filings with the SEC will be available on our website as soon as practicable after such material is filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
 
Product Overview
 Our product offering for processing on the TEO Pasteurizer/Sterilizer will be single serve and multi-serve entrees and side dishes focusing on convenience items that drive superior margins.  We will offer varying levels of vegetarian, organic, all natural, ethnic and home-style entrees that command a premium price in the market place.  Each meal will contain a starch and multiple vegetables with an exquisite sauce to compliment the meal.  Sauce quality will help us differentiate our products along with our unique production process. The vegetables will be high quality vegetables such as broccoli florets with no stems.  (Example: Teriyaki Rice Bowl with Vegetables or Home Style Garlic Mashed Potatoes).  The meals will have universal appeal but will also target specific demographic groups such as vegetarians and consumers who value organic meals. This type of product was selected based on current trends, our unique production process and handling requirements needed to process USDA meat components. Secondarily, these products are expected to have higher pricing to consumers which supports the use of high-quality components and the limited initial production throughput.
 
This preliminary product mix may change prior to initial production based on additional market research and customer input.  There is a unique opportunity to market multiple products, so consumers can "mix 'n match" meal components such as buying a side dish of garlic mashed potatoes and a serving of their favorite vegetable in sauce.
 
Management will initially produce single and multi-serve entrees & side dishes that have extended shelf life in a "refrigerated" format with the long-term intent to market shelf stable meals.  The "refrigerated" status will allow us to create critical mass while simultaneously seeking Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval for our new production process.
 
The total market for frozen, refrigerated and shelf stable entrees and side dishes is a very dynamic marketplace that welcomes new product ideas.  We expect the extended shelf life will be embraced by wholesale customers due to supply chain issues of refrigerated foods and the application of a pasteurization/sterilization process in this category adds a food safety component that is not provided by other products in this category.

Benefits of the Licensed Process and Improved Products
 Quality, safety and convenience are what we believe to be the primary benefits to the licensed process.
 
The process is expected to produce sterilized meals in less than 15 minutes of processing time with time at sterilization temperatures targeted to preserve quality and assure safety. Pasteurization is expected in less processing time. We believe that achieving rapid heat rise times to sterilization temperature and rapid cool time back to near ambient or refrigerated temperature will produce meals that have improved taste, texture, color and nutritional values over conventional retort sterilization methods which can subject the food to high temperatures for an hour or more.
 
Our process utilizes microwave energy to achieve rapid heating of packaged food products. Food packages are filled and sealed using standard industry systems and enter our system via conveyor. Multiple tuned cavities apply varying power levels to rapidly and evenly heat the food to the desired temperature.
 
Retort methods place the product in a steam chamber and must rely on thermal transfer of heat from the outer surfaces to reach the center. Like cooking a roast in a conventional oven, it can take a very long time for the center to reach the desired temperature.
 
Microwave energy penetrates the food and can heat throughout the product with some limitations on depth of penetration and the challenges of overheating patterns.
 
The currently licensed 200-kilowatt system we intend to use for our products is designed to process twelve-ounce rigid tray packages. The system may be utilized in different configurations to achieve different levels of pasteurization /sterilization. The tray passing through the exposure cavities is heated to the desired temperature in about two minutes.
 
We believe the quality related to pasteurized/refrigerated foods will be comparable as these products are not subjected to high sterilization temperatures for extended periods. These products have a consumer perception of being high quality, healthy and nearly fresh prepared foods. We believe our products will be of equal or better quality and have a near fresh taste.


Our products will have an added safety benefit over many current offerings of refrigerated and frozen products because we will have subjected the products to pasteurization/sterilization temperatures; killing off resistant microorganisms that may remain viable in many traditional frozen and refrigerated products. Consumers often put themselves to health risks by failing to heat frozen and refrigerated products to safe temperatures prior to consumption. Consumers may not realize that the frozen or refrigerated products they are purchasing may not have undergone any sterilization processes. The importance of warning labels and instructions to cook thoroughly before eating can go ignored by a consumer heating a meal hastily during a lunch break.
 
We believe retailers and consumers will benefit from our distribution as a refrigerated product due to the extended shelf life we intend to provide. Our products can be processed at sterilization temperatures and will have packaging with high barrier properties; resulting in the ability to offer longer shelf life as a refrigerated product. This can result in less waste to the retailer and better quality to the consumer throughout the shelf life of the product.
 
We believe our products will be less susceptible to distribution variables that can affect safety and quality of frozen and refrigerated products. Frozen products can thaw and refreeze several times before they are eaten by the consumer. Variation of refrigeration temperatures during distribution and at the retailers can cause safety risks and quality issues to consumers refrigerated products.
 
Once our products are approved for shelf stable distribution, we expect consumers, customers and retailers to eventually prefer the convenience of the ambient ready to eat meal versus frozen or refrigerated meals.
 
When consumers become familiar and trust our products as refrigerated, we hope to transition those products out of refrigeration where we expect consumers to embrace the convenience of a high quality, healthy, ready to eat meal. The ambient meal can be warmed in 30 to 60 seconds. A typical comparable frozen meal can require 5 minutes or more and often requires multiple steps of heating and stirring.
 
We will likely maintain distribution as refrigerated products even after we are approved for shelf stable distribution due to the negative quality perception and low price point of the existing shelf stable products in the U.S. markets.

Market Overview
 The global frozen food market size was valued at USD 291.3 billion in 2019. Growing importance of Ready-to-Eat (RTE) food products as a result of hectic lifestyles among working class individuals on a global level is expected to expand the industry size over the next few years. Moreover, increasing spending on shelf-stable foods among consumers is anticipated to expand the market for frozen food in the near future.
 
The frozen ready meals segment accounted for more than 30.0% of revenue share in 2019 in the frozen food market. The segment is expected to maintain its dominance over the forecast period [2020 to 2026] on account of pre-dominant consumption of ready meals among working class people around the globe.
 
Some of the manufacturers include Wawona Frozen Foods; Bellisio Foods; McCain Foods; ConAgra Foods, Inc.; General Mills, Inc.; and Nestle S.A. Industry participants have been focusing on ensuring the continuous stock access in the supermarkets and hypermarkets amid the coronavirus breakdown. In March 2020, the CEO of the Kraft Heinz Co. has officially announced that the company is working hard for filling the demand supply gap owning to the seismic changes in the food industry. The company confirmed that frozen food, macaroni, cheese, and vinegar are one of the largest selling products and their demand has been witnessing surge significantly amid coronavirus breakdown. (https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/frozen-food-market)
 
The global ready meals market size was valued at USD 159.15 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5% from 2020 to 2027. Shifting consumers’ food preferences towards ready-to-eat food products owing to busy lifestyle of working individuals as well as hectic work schedules of college grads and students is expected to be a key factor for the market growth. Moreover, growing demand for minimally processed and additive-free food products with extended shelf life is expected to fuel the market growth.
 
In recent years, the employment has been growing across the globe, which has changed the food preferences of the consumers. Customers around the globe are more inclining towards food items that can easily be consumed without any efforts. Due to hectic work schedules, people around the globe are buying Ready-to-Eat (RTE) food products and meals, which are easy to cook and less time consuming. These consumer food preferences are propelling the demand for ready meals.
 
Frozen and chilled meals held the largest revenue share of more than 50.0% in 2019 and are expected to maintain their lead over the forecast period owing to a wide range of products with high shelf life. Frozen pizza is the most popular frozen ready meal, thereby significantly contributing to the global revenue.
 
Supermarket and hypermarket held the largest revenue share of 59.4% in 2019 and are expected to maintain their lead over the forecast period. Some of the largest chains of supermarket and hypermarket, such as Walmart, Tesco, 7Eleven, Apar, and Aldi, are expanding their stores across the globe. These market giants are increasing their product offerings in order to attract the customers. (https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/ready-meals-market)
 
We believe we can market long shelf life refrigerated and shelf stable Ready-to-Eat (RTE) food products and meals that capitalize on consumer trends with great nutrition, value, taste and texture.

The Consumer
 We expect domestic consumers to have initial reservations regarding ambient ready to eat meals. Consumers are familiar with frozen products of this type and will likely have quality, taste, health and safety concerns related to sterilization and ambient storage.
 
We will initially market our products as refrigerated. Consumers can transition to accept our ambient product through familiarity with an extended life refrigerated product.  Based on our success with consumers in the refrigerated category we envision having both refrigerated and shelf stable entrees and sides. Consumers will need to slowly transition to shelf stable entrees and sides once they gain trust in product quality.   An example of this transition in the U.S. market was the marketing of UHT soy and dairy products in the chilled section of the supermarkets. These products are shelf stable for months but required marketing in the chilled dairy section to develop sales with U.S. consumers. Slowly we saw these products moved from chilled to the shelf.
 
We expect consumers, customers and retailers to eventually prefer the convenience of the ambient ready to eat meal versus frozen or refrigerated meals. The meal can be eaten as is or heated.  We expect the most popularly used heating method will be in a common home microwave oven. Consumers are expected to enjoy a more appealing final reheated meal. The ambient meal can be warmed in 30 to 60 seconds. A typical comparable frozen meal requires 5 minutes or more and often requires multiple steps of heating and stirring.
 
Distribution
 We anticipate using traditional supply chain partners to get to market. We expect to market products regionally based on our first production line. Upon regional success, we will add lines when needed to service customers on a national basis.  Management believes our biggest distribution challenge will be creating critical mass to drive reasonable supply chain costs from storage to actual frequent shipments to customers, so they have acceptable inventory turns.
 
Other foodservice, c-store, vending and military customers may also place our product and force distribution accordingly, but we will still be faced with supporting reasonable supply chain costs.
 
We will initially distribute all our products as chilled.  We have no domestic distribution agreements established at this time. We can distribute in Mexico through our subsidiary, BCTEO Foods Mexico, and our licensed Nerys brand placements in grocery and convenience stores.
 
Branding
 We intend to build a new brand in refrigerated and shelf stable entrees and sides.  We will also produce private label products for other brands and retailers.
 
We will be faced with the traditional challenges of introducing, marketing and gaining consumer acceptance of food products to consumers in highly competitive markets dominated by mega companies with generationally established brand recognition.
 
Management believes by changing the technology in refrigerated and shelf stable entree product life/shelf life, it is an ideal opportunity to carve out a new branded position.  We view the use of extended refrigerated shelf life and subsequent introduction of quality long-life, high-quality shelf stable entrees as a means to establish a new brand in the market.  The benefit of refining the sterilization process is a major point of differentiation in the marketplace.  We expect to receive limited competitive response since "price" won't be a determining factor due to our extended shelf life and high quality.
 
We will brand and also offer private label to continue the current perception of "prepared on premise" with national retailers.  In other segments such as military, c-store, etc., private label may be more prevalent.

Competition
 We will be competing with major food companies that have substantially more resources and influence over retail placements, distribution and supply chain.
 
Mega companies like Con-Agra, Nestle, Tyson and others dominate the markets and have many brands and products competing for retail shelf space.
 
If we are able to gain a market presence with our unique products and process in the domestic refrigerated category these larger competitors could utilize their vast resources to develop and market products to compete.
 
There is room for new competitors in both refrigerated and shelf stable entrees & sides.  Frozen competitors are not expected to view us as an immediate threat due to the convenience and long life of current frozen food formats.  Once retailers embrace our product offerings due to their long shelf life and as we fine tune our process we expect competitors will then react to us more aggressively.
 
Certain Agreements
 Our current agreements consist primarily of business to business agreements. These agreements enable and facilitate the introduction of our branded products into the market.
 
Royalty and License Agreement
 On September 30, 2017, the Company entered into a Master Agreement with TEO Inc. ("TEO"). TEO is the founder and majority controlling shareholder of the Company. The Master Agreement provides the Company a license to use the TEO name and logo on food products it sells and to apply TEO's pasteurization/sterilization processes to its products for improved shelf life and safety. Additional provisions provide the Company production rights to TEO's pasteurizer/sterilizer and rights to lease its own system when certain sales/production increase.
Research and Development
 We do not engage in research and development activities as part of our business at this time. We will cooperate with TEO Inc. in its research and development of its pasteurization/sterilization technology pursuant to the terms of the Master Agreement.
Intellectual Property and Licenses
 We have a license agreement with TEO Inc. The Master Agreement provides the Company a license to use the TEO name and logo on food products it sells and to apply TEO's pasteurization/sterilization processes to its products for improved shelf life and safety. Additional provisions provide the Company production rights to TEO's pasteurizer/sterilizer and rights to lease its own system when certain sales/production increase.
 
We do not currently hold Patent rights. We may develop certain recipes and formulae related to our products in the ordinary course of business. We may develop additional trademark and other branding related intellectual property as we launch and market our products.
 
Government Regulation
 We will be producing and selling food products in the domestic and international markets. We will be required to comply with various regulations in each jurisdiction related to food safety and consumer protection. We will be required to comply with regulations related to food handling, packaging, labeling, storage and shipping. International sales will have to comply with customs regulations.
 
We intend to introduce our initial products in the refrigerated category which does not require regulatory approval. When we choose to proceed with the introduction of products in the shelf stable category we will be required to have approval from the FDA to sell our products in the United States as shelf stable.  Although, microwave sterilization technology for packaged shelf stable meals was accepted by FDA in 2010, each process and product application must be approved prior to any sales as shelf stable.
 
Obtaining these approvals can take more than a year and require extensive data and expert support to obtain an approval which with the application of any novel technology may never be granted. It was a concern for many years that any microwave-based sterilization process would ever be approved by the FDA given the challenges to validation data where many traditional temperature measurement methods are incompatible with the application of microwave energy.
 
We believe that the system production data from our sale of products in the refrigerated category will be supportive to an application to the FDA by TEO Inc. for shelf stable approval. TEO Inc. would make the determination of when to proceed with an application and bear the costs related to the application.  TEO Inc. does not have an application for shelf stable approval pending with the FDA at this time.
 
We are not currently aware of any pending regulations that would materially impact our operations.
