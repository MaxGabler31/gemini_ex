ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Company Overview
We develop technology that connects advertisers with consumers through interactions with content across devices. The Inuvo Exchange provides the means to interact with tens of thousands of advertisers (Demand) and tens of thousands of online publishers (Supply). We interact with Demand/Supply constituents directly and indirectly. We serve ads within content, video and slideshows. We target ads to consumers using our proprietary IntentKey, a form of artificial intelligence ("AI") that uses the Internet as a source of information. The result of the AI includes a database of over 500 million machine profiles, of which over 100 million are updated each week. We use this AI as the means to develop and deliver online audiences to our advertisers. We earn revenue when consumers view and/or click on our ads. Our business scales as we add Demand and Supply relationships with many barriers to entry including the ability to process hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. Collectively, our technology platforms facilitate the buying and selling of media in a manner that positions Inuvo as an advertising exchange.
Our intellectual property is protected by fifteen issued and eight pending patents. We count among our many contractual relationships, three clients who collectively manage over 50% of all US digital advertising budgets. Included within our Supply portfolio is a collection of owned websites such as alot.com and earnspendlive.com, where we create content in health, finance, travel, careers, auto, education and living categories. These sites provide the means to test ad-tech, while also delivering high quality consumers to advertisers through interaction with proprietary content in the form of images, videos, slideshows and the written word. 
Products and Services
The Inuvo Exchange is digital marketplace that allows advertisers and publishers the opportunity to buy and sell advertising space in real time. The Exchange includes the following products and services:

• | ValidClick: A software as a service and delivery platform for publishers that offers a pay-per-click solution where advertisements are targeted to consumers based on content and behaviors.


• | Digital Publishing: Branded web properties like ALOT.com, earnspendlive.com, search4answers.com and many more with content developed, edited and published by Inuvo in categories like health, finance, travel, entertainment, careers, education, lifestyle and automotive.


• | Visual Monetization Platform ("VMP"): A Supply Side Platform ("SSP") that offers publishers numerous forms of monetization both visually (images and video) and within or surrounding content.


• | IntentKey: A consumer intent recognition system designed to reach highly targeted mobile and desktop In-Market audiences with precision.


• | Audience Delivery Solutions: Inuvo’s audience delivery solution is a campaign management and optimization service for advertisers that uses the IntentKey and our proprietary Demand Side Platform (“DSP”).


• | MYAP: A proprietary online affiliate management solution that provides advertisers with the ability to sign up, manage and track the activities of publishers through a privately-branded platform with full data transparency. Typically, each MYAP customer is supported by a customized software implementation.

Key Relationships
We maintain long-standing relationships with Yahoo! and Google that provide access to hundreds of thousands of advertisers from which most of our ValidClick and Digital Publishing revenue originates. When an advertisement is clicked, we effectively sell that click to these partners who then sell it to the advertisers. We maintain multi-year service contracts with both companies. The Yahoo! Agreement continues through May 31, 2018 and the Google agreement through February 28, 2019. We also have a contract with OpenX that provides access to thousands of advertisers from which a large part of our VMP and Audience Delivery Solution revenue originates. Typically, an advertiser from the OpenX network pays when an advertisement we serve is viewed. In 2017, these three customers accounted for 86.5% of our total revenue.

In addition to our key customer relationships, we maintain important distribution relationships with owners and publishers of websites and mobile applications. Through our relationship with Yahoo! we provide these partners with advertisements through which they monetize their websites and mobile applications. We continuously monitor our partners' traffic with a variety of proprietary and patent protected software tools that can determine the quality of the traffic that is viewing and clicking on served advertisements.
Strategy
Our business strategy has been to develop technologies that displace intermediaries while cultivating relationships that provide access to media spend and media inventory. In this regard, we have proprietary demand and supply side technologies, consumer targeting technologies, on-page or in-app ad-unit technologies, unique data, and advertising fraud detection technologies. We have both direct and indirect relationships at some of the largest media buyers and/or consolidators in the industry. For our core business, this strategy implies a more direct line of site to advertisers and consumers.
Our competitive position requires a strategy that allows us to provide the absolute best solutions to publishers for monetization of their content. To accelerate the time to market for technology that accomplishes this goal and to gain competitive reconnaissance, we have developed a set of owned and operated digital properties. These websites provide the means to test advertising technology in a controlled environment which in turn reduces the time to market for the introduction of those technologies. The strategy has the added benefit of providing a high quality directly controlled source of advertising inventory which can be adapted to meet demand and supply changes in near real time.
Our industry is currently in a consolidation phase. Our business strategy aligns with this trend as it is by design an end-to-end complete approach to the value chain. We evaluate acquisition candidates as opportunities arise that have either advertisers or advertising relationships we do not possess or publishers or publishing partners with whom we do not currently have a relationship.
Our device strategy is to become screen agnostic. We will continue to develop technologies that allow us to distribute ads across any medium.
Sales and Marketing
We drive general awareness of our brands through various marketing channels including our websites, social media, blogs, public relations, trade shows, conferences and similar means. Sales and Marketing for our products differs based on whether they are demand or supply facing.
The demand side of our business includes sales executives who create demand from agencies, trading desks and brands directly. Leveraging our IntentKey technology to highlight our differentiation, our sales executives explain how we identify the most relevant content and audiences, allowing us to target these consumers when they are most prone to engage / respond / subscribe / tune-in and watch. Our product organization fulfills the business development initiatives that cement profitable relationships with programmatic demand partners, who are incorporated into our stack to drive monetization for our publishing partners.
The supply side of our business includes sales executives who sell to publishers directly. Creating differentiation, they explain our unique ability to create incremental revenue streams for publishers through our custom placements and unique approach to maximizing yield while preserving user experience.
Both demand and supply relationships require account management/campaign management, plus operations teams, who ensure that publisher implementations are successful, advertising campaigns deliver anticipated results and clients’ expectations are exceeded.
Competition
We face significant competition in our industry. Competitors continue to increase their suite of offerings across marketing channels to better compete for total advertising dollars.
A significant number of competitors have greater name recognition and are better capitalized than we are. Our ability to remain competitive in our market segment depends upon our ability to be innovative and to efficiently provide unique solutions to our demand and supply customers. There are no assurances we will be able to remain competitive in our markets in the future.

Technology Platforms
Our proprietary applications are constructed from established, readily available technologies. Some of the basic elements our products are built on are components from leading software and hardware providers such as Oracle, Microsoft, Sun, Dell, EMC, and Cisco, while some components are constructed from leading open source software projects such as Apache Web Server, MySQL, Java, Perl, Java and Linux. By seeking to strike the proper balance between using commercially available software and open source software, our technology expenditures are directed toward maintaining our technology platforms while minimizing third-party technology supplier costs.

We strive to build high-performance, availability and reliability into our product offerings. We safeguard against the potential for service interruptions at our third-party technology vendors by engineering controls into our critical components. We deliver our hosted solutions from facilities, geographically disbursed throughout the United States and maintain ready, on-demand services through third-party cloud providers Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services to enhance our business continuity. Our applications are monitored 24 hours a day, 365 days a year by specialized monitoring systems that aggregate alarms to a human-staffed network operations center. If a problem occurs, appropriate engineers are notified, and corrective action is taken.
Intellectual Property Rights
We own intellectual property (IP) and related IP rights that relate to our products, services and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, trade secrets and trademarks. We actively seek to protect our IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets.  While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, trademark, or other IP right. 
Our trademarks include the U.S. Federal Registration for our consumer facing brand ALOT® in the United States.  Our patents include fifteen patents issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and eight pending patent applications.
To distinguish our products and services from our competitors’ products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.
Employees
As of January 31, 2018, we had 80 full-time employees, none of which are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Seasonality
Our future results of operations may be subject to fluctuation because of seasonality. Historically, in the later part of the fourth quarter and the earlier part of the first quarter we experience lower revenue due to a decline in demand for inventory on websites and apps and the recalibrating of advertiser’s marketing budgets after the holiday selling season. If we are not able to appropriately adjust to seasonal or other factors, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
History
We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada in October 1987 and operated within the oil and gas industry. This endeavor was not profitable, and from 1993 to 1997 we had essentially no operations. In 1997 we reorganized and through 2006 we acquired a number of companies involved in advertising and internet marketing. In 2009, following the weakness in the economy, a new team was called in to assess the array of businesses that had been acquired in the preceding years and as a result between 2009 and 2011, we sold or retired eleven businesses.
In March 2012, as part of a long-term strategy, we acquired Vertro, Inc. ("Vertro"), which owns and operates the ALOT product portfolio. This acquisition included the ALOT brand, as well as a long-standing relationship with Google. In 2013, with a grant funded by the State of Arkansas, we moved the headquarters to Arkansas where we have remained. 
In February 2017, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with NetSeer, Inc. ("NetSeer") which allowed us to advance our technology strategy while increasing both the number of advertisers and publishers within the Inuvo Exchange. We

exchanged 3,529,000 shares of Inuvo common stock and assumed approximately $6.8 million of specified liabilities in this business combination (See Note 15).
