Overview 
 
RGS Energy and its subsidiaries (“RGS”, “we,” “us,” or the “Company”) have provided solar energy systems to homeowners, and commercial building owners in the United States since 1978. We believe that solar energy adoption is still in the early stages and will continue to increase as utility rates rise and customers become more knowledgeable about the savings clean and sustainable solar energy can deliver. RGS and our predecessors have installed over 26,000 solar energy systems across the continental United States and Hawaii.
 
We endeavor to make the move to solar energy simple for our customers by managing and executing the process with our sales and installation teams. We design and offer a suitable solar energy solution, then procure, permit, install, and interconnect the system to the utility grid. We provide a comprehensive workmanship warranty on each fully operational system.
 
On September 29, 2017 we executed an exclusive domestic and international world-wide Technology License Agreement (the “License”) with Dow Global Technologies LLC (“Dow”) for its POWERHOUSE™ in-roof solar shingle, an innovative and aesthetically pleasing solar shingle system developed by Dow. The POWERHOUSE™ 1.0 and 2.0 versions used CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide solar cells) technology which had a high manufacturing cost, resulting in the product not being consumer price friendly. Conversely, the POWERHOUSE™ 3.0 has been developed with traditional silicon solar cells to increase solar production and to provide a competitive consumer price point. On November 2, 2018 we received United Laboratories (“UL”) certification for POWERHOUSE™ 3.0 and began to commercialize the product in North America. We have engaged third-party manufacturers for production and distribution logistics and to provide services to the home building and roofing industries.
 
We were incorporated in Colorado in 2008 as a successor to Gaiam Energy Tech, Inc. founded in 1999.
 
A description about our operating segments and the financial information about our segments may be found in Note 15. Segment Information, to our audited financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Recent Developments 
 
The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC suspended trading of our Class A common stock on February 15, 2019 and filed a Form 25-NSE with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 12, 2019, which delisted the Class A common stock from Nasdaq at the opening of the trading session on March 22, 2019 and is expected to deregister the Class A Common Stock from Section 12(b) of the Act on June 10, 2019.
 
On March 7, 2019, we announced we had commenced a process to explore strategic alternatives focusing on maximizing shareholder value. Strategic alternatives to consider may include, among others, a sale of the Company, a business combination such as a merger with another party, or a strategic investment financing which would allow the Company to continue its current business plan of commercializing POWERHOUSE™ solar shingles. We have not set a timeline for this process and there can be no assurance that the strategic alternatives review process will result in a transaction or other strategic change or outcome. We do not expect to discuss or disclose further developments regarding the strategic alternatives review process unless and until our Board of Directors has approved a specific course of action or we have otherwise determined that further disclosure is appropriate or required by law.
 
On March 27, 2019, our Board of Directors determined to exit our mainland residential solar business to focus on the POWERHOUSE™ in-roof shingle market and reduce overall cash outflow, with the goal of maximizing future shareholder value. We believe this structure and realignment enables us to effectively manage our operations and resources. This realignment is expected to result in the reduction of workforce payroll plus burden of approximately $4.0 million annually.  Revenues and net loss in 2018 for the mainland residential solar business were approximately $8.9 million and $6.3 million, respectively. In order for us to convert our existing backlog to revenue, we plan to use authorized integrators to complete installations throughout the remainder of 2019.
 
As previously reported on Form 8-K filed April 4, 2019, on April 2, 2019, we closed a registered offering in which we issued and sold (i) 15,938,280 shares of Class A common stock, (ii) prepaid Series S Warrants to purchase 1,430,141 shares of Class A common stock and (iii) Series R Warrants to purchase 17,368,421 shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement dated April 2, 2019 between us and three institutional and accredited investors. The investors paid $0.19 per share of Class A common stock and $0.18 per share of Class A common stock underlying the Series S Warrant for aggregate gross proceeds of $3.3 million at the closing and before $0.35 million of expenses.
 
Business Strategy 
 
Our goals are to (i) provide solar solutions that save residential and commercial customers’ money and (ii) operate our Company at a profit. Our strategies to achieve these goals are:

• | Commercialize the POWERHOUSE™ 3.0 in-roof solar shingle. We have executed an exclusive domestic and international world-wide License with Dow for its POWERHOUSE™ 3.0 in-roof solar shingle to provide customers with a more aesthetically pleasing solar shingle system. We plan to sell the product directly to homebuilders and develop a network of authorized roofers. We have started to market POWERHOUSE™ 3.0 in the United States and hope to expand internationally in the future. We believe that as we have just started manufacturing and marketing POWERHOUSE™, it will take us several quarters to commercialize this new product and achieve a balance between customer demand and the manufacturing production by our contract supply chain. We believe that we will require time to build brand awareness for this new product and, accordingly, we expect our sales to begin slowly and grow in future periods.

• | Utilize our call center. In past years, we have built a call center in our headquarters in Colorado to conduct sales via the phone and internet. This provides a cost-effective mechanism to reach potential customers and enter new markets. We plan to expand into new states of operation in 2019. Call center personnel have access to engineering, operations, customer support and other services personnel at our headquarters location allowing them to quickly address any questions that might arise during the sales process.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to drive growth through referrals networks. We pay customers and others for referring additional customers. We will continue to expand these programs through the call center, post-install in-home parties, user-friendly software, and digital marketing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Identify attractive financing options for customers. We refer our customers to a variety of options for financing their solar energy systems including home improvement loans, equipment leases and power purchase agreements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Utilize technology to enhance and streamline our operations. We launched RGS 365™, a mobile software and online dashboard suite, creating what we believe is a better and more engaging customer experience. 

Our Competitive Strengths 
 
We believe being awarded the exclusive worldwide POWERHOUSE™ License will give us a competitive advantage because we expect to become a technology company insulated by patents creating a barrier to competition, as well as a company selling a product with brand recognition.
 
Historically, we believe our customers select us because:
 

• | We have been in the solar industry for over 40 years.
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexible menu of product financing options. Our customers can utilize cash, loans, and third-party ownership agreements, such as leasing and power purchase agreements, to acquire our products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Location. We are located in states where utility costs are high and/or incentives for solar energy systems are available, therefore offering an attractive alternative to conventional power sources.

Description of our Product and Services 
 
We had two operating divisions as of the end of 2018: (i) POWERHOUSE™ and (ii) Solar Division.
 
POWERHOUSE™:  On September 29, 2017, we executed the License with Dow, to commercialize POWERHOUSE™ 3.0. Under the terms of the License, we have exclusive world-wide rights through 2034, the expiration of Dow’s applicable patents. The License requires that we obtain United Laboratories (“UL”) certification to commercialize and sell a minimum of 50 megawatts of solar within 5-years after obtaining UL certification to retain exclusive world-wide rights, a requirement we believe is achievable. We obtained UL certification on November 2, 2018. We have entered into third-party manufacturing agreements with suppliers and have begun to market POWERHOUSE™ solar shingles to a network of new home builders and roofers.
Solar Division: The Solar Division performs installations of residential and commercial solar systems in the continental United States (also referred to as “Mainland”) and in Hawaii, doing business as Sunetric. We offer our turnkey solar energy systems providing design, engineering, financing, procurement, permitting, installing, grid interconnection, monitoring, and maintenance services. We install residential systems generally between 3 kilowatts (“kW”) and 10 kW, and commercial systems up to 500 kW in size, depending on the amount of electricity used by the customer and the size of their building. The size of the average solar energy system we installed during 2018 was approximately 8.7 kW. We maintain a service department to manage and assist with service and repairs, and to provide operations and maintenance service contracts for larger projects. We design and build solar energy systems to meet each customer’s individual needs and circumstances. We assess a customer’s annual power requirements and average electricity rates to size the solar system and engineer its interconnection to the grid. We assess the customer’s roof size, configuration, and composition to determine the optimum location for the solar photovoltaic modules. We factor in information about the customer’s electrical service territory, rate structures, budget, preferred financing method and aesthetic preferences. We also identify the relevant federal, state and local regulations, including building codes, which are important to the cost, operation and return on investment of the customer’s solar energy system, as well as relevant tax rates, benefits of net metering, and various other factors. We assess this data using solar production tools and analytical models to size and configure a cost-effective solar system for the customer and one that offers a return on investment to the customer that meets their requirements.

We prepare construction plans to obtain a building permit, which is necessary for grid interconnection and state incentive rebate processing. We also provide customers with a return-on-investment analysis which reflects the rebates and performance-based incentives that are available to each customer. Once all necessary approvals from financing partners and utilities, and incentive, rebate and jurisdictional authorities have been received, our in-house construction teams or authorized integrators begin the installation of the customer’s solar energy system. Once the solar energy system has been installed, we arrange for a final inspection by the local building department or other relevant regulatory agency and complete final as-built drawings of the system to submit applicable applications for the jurisdictional rebate(s). At the same time, we apply to the local utility company to finalize interconnection of the customer’s solar energy system to the utility grid.
 
Solar Energy Systems 
 
The most visible component of solar energy systems are the solar shingles or photovoltaic modules with metal racking which transforms the sunlight into direct electrical current (“DC”), which then travels to the inverter. The inverter converts the DC electricity into useable alternating current (“AC”) that matches the current of the household electrical service and the utility grid. Other major components include the monitoring system which tracks the solar production of the system, and balance of system which includes mechanical and electrical parts. The electricity created can go onto the grid or be used by the customer to power household items such as lights and appliances. For customers who would like to have electrical black out protection or who want to strategically manage their electrical usage, we provide battery solutions that integrate with our solar energy systems.
POWERHOUSE™: Our product is a built-in photovoltaic array (“BIPV”), also known as a solar shingle. The solar shingle is a building material that once installed becomes the roof structure. The BIPV is the equivalent of the photovoltaic module and racking of a traditional solar energy installation. We do not install these systems. Instead, we manufacture the solar shingle for distribution to our targeted customers.
 
Solar Division: The Solar Division sells and installs traditional modules and racking photovoltaic solar energy systems. We do not manufacture any of these components. We purchase all components from the manufacturer or their distributors.

Warranty Terms 
 
POWERHOUSE™: We issue a manufacturer’s warranty on POWERHOUSE™ solar shingles, equal to the third-party manufacturer terms we secure. Workmanship warranty will be provided by the installer. Our new home builder and roofer network, when applicable, will submit to us a return merchandise authorization (“RMA”) for defective components. We will authorize the RMA and transfer substitute POWERHOUSE™ component(s) to the customer who will return a like number of defective components. We will similarly execute a RMA with the appropriate manufacturer.
Solar Division: We and our suppliers offer warranties of up to 10 years for parts and labor, including property damage arising from workmanship, excluding roof penetrations which are generally warrantied for a period of 5 years. All major components installed in a photovoltaic system array are covered under transferable manufacturers’ warranties, which generally range from 10 to 25 years. Customer claims are processed through our customer service department. We will provide reasonable assistance to our customers in contacting the manufacturer concerning warranty service and undertake reasonable effort to recoup our labor costs from the manufacturer.
Financing 
 
We make available to our POWERHOUSE™ local roofing company customers a business-to-business lender to finance their purchases from us.
 
We offer our Solar Division customers a choice to finance their solar systems with their cash, third-party loans, or third-party leases or power purchase agreements. We are constantly vetting new financing products and only refer the ones that fit the customer’s needs and desires. Our menu of finance offerings allows us to provide solar energy systems to our customers with financing terms that we believe are economically attractive for their individual situation.

Sales and Marketing
 
Our targeted customers for our POWERHOUSE™ in-roof solar shingle include (i) homeowners, (ii) local roofing companies, (iii) solar installation companies, (iv) custom homebuilders and (v) mass market homebuilders. We utilize our call center to contact customers in our geographic markets. We offer additional services, such as marketing support, referrals and on-site training to roofing companies that complete our requirements for becoming a POWERHOUSE™ Professional.
 
We have and plan to continue to make marketing expenditures to develop brand name recognition for POWERHOUSE™. Our marketing has to-date included digital marketing, attendance at trade shows and expos, and we have arranged for television presentations.
 
In the Solar Division, we have trained our residential and commercial sales organization to effectively engage prospective customers from initial interest to customized proposals to signed contracts. We intend to continue to educate consumers about the benefits of our solar products in order to lower our customer acquisition costs and further expand the market opportunity.
 

• | Inside sales – Our inside sales groups initially engage with potential customers prior to our outside sales or e-sales teams’ customer engagement. Inside sales groups identify each potential customer’s initial interest in solar energy and compile data necessary to assess potential cost savings for subsequent discussion with the potential customer by the sales teams.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Direct outside sales – We employ an outside commercial sales force in the east coast markets and Hawaii to generate new business and complete sales orders. Effective March 1, 2018, we completed a realignment of our sales teams resulting in the elimination of our east coast residential sales force. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer referrals – Our customer referral program is designed to be an effective and efficient method of reaching new customers. Our program provides cash incentives to current customers to refer friends, relatives and co-workers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Online Digital Marketing – Consumers seek online education, purchase options, and business reviews before determining the best provider to meet their needs. To align our business with marketplace, and our sales teams with the consumer, we continue to expand our online market presence.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers 
 
POWERHOUSE™: Our customers will include homeowners, new homebuilders, engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) solar companies and roofers in the re-roof market. We estimate there are approximately 7 million re-roofs and new home construction annually in the United States.
Solar Division: Our residential customers are homeowners interested in reducing electrical utility costs and switching to clean, renewable energy. Our residential solar energy systems are generally rooftop installations up to 24kW in size.
 
Our commercial customers come from a variety of industries including retail, manufacturing, service, not-for-profit and municipal services. Oftentimes, our small commercial clients arise from the relationship developed when we install a residential solar system to the owner of the small business. Our commercial solar energy systems may be roof mounted or ground mounted and are generally up to 500kW in size. Occasionally, through the course of our normal operations, we are presented with opportunities for larger (greater than 500kW) commercial solar energy systems. We evaluate each of these large opportunities on a case by case basis while minimizing onerous contract terms.
 
Suppliers 
 
POWERHOUSE™: We engage third-party manufacturers to manufacture components of the in-roof POWERHOUSE™ solar shingle. The major components of the POWERHOUSE™ solar shingle consist of the solar laminate, connectors, wire harnesses, base assembly and integrated flashing system. The solar laminate, connectors and wire harnesses are produced by a manufacturer located in China and shipped to our U.S. based manufacturer of the baseplate for assembly into a solar shingle. The solar shingle is then shipped to our third-party logistics provider to warehouse and distribute kitted systems to our customers.
Solar Division: Our solar energy systems utilize photovoltaic modules and inverters purchased from several manufacturers and distributors. The majority of these materials are “Buy American” under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. We negotiate pricing based on quantity purchased and payment terms. Generally, we purchase major components as needed and do not have long-term or volume commitments with suppliers.

Competition 
 
POWERHOUSE™: The Dow Chemical Company developed the POWERHOUSE™ solar shingle and holds various related worldwide patents. Since we obtained the exclusive License to commercialize the product worldwide from Dow, the patents and licenses provide a barrier to entry, thereby limiting the number of competitors. Existing sources of competition include Tesla, Inc., Suntegra and CertainTeed, whom we compete with on market penetration, price and aesthetics. We believe we compete favorably with these companies.
Solar Division: We believe our primary competitors are the traditional local utilities that supply energy to our potential customers. We compete with these traditional utilities primarily based on price, predictability of price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems rather than fossil-based alternatives. We believe that our pricing and focus on customer relationships allow us to compete favorably with traditional utilities in the regions we service.
 
Other sources of competition are other solar energy system providers such as Tesla, Inc., Vivint Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc., Sungevity, Inc., and many others. These companies may offer products that are similar to our solar energy systems, and we primarily compete with these companies based on price. We believe that we compete favorably with these companies.
 
Regulations 
 
POWERHOUSE™: We will have to maintain compliance with UL standards on POWERHOUSE™ 3.0 solar shingles and on any future new product development.
 
Solar Division: An interconnection agreement is generally required from the applicable local electricity utility to interconnect a solar energy system with the utility grid. In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over interconnection. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection agreements are signed. We prepare and submit these agreements on behalf of our customers to ensure compliance with interconnection rules.
 
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or “OSHA”, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety. We expend resources to comply with OSHA requirements and industry best practices. Federal and/or state prevailing wage requirements, which generally apply to any “public works” construction project that receives public funds, may apply to installations of our solar energy systems on government facilities. The prevailing wage is the basic hourly rate paid on public works projects to a majority of workers engaged in a particular craft, classification or type of work within a particular area. Prevailing wage requirements are established and enforced by regulatory agencies. Our in-house personnel monitor and coordinate our continuing compliance with these regulations when required.
 
Some jurisdictions place limits on the size or number of solar energy systems that can be interconnected to the utility grid. This can limit our ability to sell and install solar energy systems in some markets. The regulatory environment is constantly changing.
 
Government Incentives and Policies
 
U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, production-based incentives, tax abatements and rebates. These incentives help catalyze private sector investments in solar energy, energy efficiency and energy storage measures, including the installation and operation of residential and commercial solar energy systems.
 
Following the extension of the Solar Investment Tax Credit in December 2015, the Internal Revenue Code allows a United States taxpayer to claim a tax credit of 30% of qualified expenditures for a solar energy system that is placed in service on or before December 31, 2019. This credit is scheduled to decline to 26% effective January 1, 2020, 22% in 2021, and then to 10% for commercial projects and 0% for residential projects in 2022.
 
Many U.S. states and local jurisdictions have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems, which include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits. Many state governments, investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer rebates or other cash incentives for the installation and operation of a solar energy system or energy-related products.
 
Many states have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering. Net metering typically allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility’s retail rate for energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid in excess of electric load used by customers.

Some states have established limits on net metering, fees on solar energy systems, or reduced the credit available for electricity generated by solar energy systems that are connected to the utility grid. For example, Hawaii, Nevada and Mississippi have announced net metering policies that establish wholesale rates, not retail rates, for crediting electricity produced by solar energy systems. This has adversely impacted the attractiveness of solar energy to residential customers in these markets. The California Public Utilities Commission issued a ruling that maintains the net energy metering credit at full retail value but adds new charges and requirements for customers installing a solar energy system. On the other hand, other states continue to expand their net metering programs. New York, for example, has suspended its cap on solar photovoltaic systems covered by the state’s net metering program.
 
Some states like Massachusetts have offered Solar Renewable Energy Credits (“SRECs”) that provide cash payments based on the electricity produced by solar energy systems as an incentive for customers to invest in these systems. These programs are generally capped and must be reauthorized or extended when the cap is reached in order for the incentives to be continued. The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources announced that the total capacity available under its most recent SREC program (SREC-II) for projects over 25 kW had been exceeded in early 2016, however it was announced on January 31, 2017 by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources that their new program, called Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (“SMART”), is targeted to start in April 2018 and that the SREC II program would be extended in order to bridge between the two programs. The SREC II program was ultimately extended until November 26, 2018, at which point the first applications for SMART were accepted. The first SMART incentive allocations began January 15, 2019.
 
On January 22, 2018, the Office of the President of the United States approved in substantial form, recommendations by the U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”) to impose a tariff of 30% on imports of solar cells and photovoltaic modules under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, unless specifically excluded. The 30% tariff declines 5% per year over the four-year term of the tariff. Further, the provisions of the 201 Tariff are applicable to imported solar cells and modules from Canada, despite its being a member of the North American Free Trade Act.
 
Seasonality 
 
Our quarterly net revenue and operating results for solar energy system installations are difficult to predict and have, in the past, and may, in the future, fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in state, federal, or private utility company subsidies, as well as weather, economic trends and other factors. We have historically experienced seasonality in our solar installation business, with the first quarter representing our lowest installation quarter of the year, primarily due to adverse weather. We have historically experienced seasonality in our sales of solar systems, with the fourth and first quarters of the year seeing less sales orders than the second and third quarters.
 
As we have just begun to market POWERHOUSE™ in-roof shingles, we do not have historical experience to assess seasonality for this line of business.
 
Employees 
 
As of April 10, 2019, we had approximately 70 total and full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
Offerings
 
On January 4, 2018, we closed a $1.8 million offering and sale of (a) 800,000 shares of Class A common stock, (b) a prepaid Series P Warrant to purchase 800,000 shares of Class A common stock, and (c) a Series O Warrant to purchase 1,600,000 shares of Class A common stock, pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of January 2, 2018, by and between us and one unaffiliated institutional and accredited investor. The purchase price was $1.15 per share of Class A common stock. We received net proceeds of approximately $1.5 million at the closing, after deducting commissions to the placement agents and estimated offering expenses payable by us associated with the offering.
 
On March 30, 2018, we entered into a Securities Purchases Agreement with two unaffiliated institutional and accredited investors for a private placement (the "2018 Notes Offering") of up to $10.75 million in principal amount and $10 million funding amount (reflecting $750,000 of original issue discount) of Senior Convertible Notes (the "2018 Notes"), and Series Q Warrants to purchase 9,270,457 shares of Class A Common Stock. As of December 31, 2018, the 2018 Notes Offering has resulted in our issuing 82 million shares of Class A common stock in exchange for gross proceeds of $18.6 million, before placement agent fees and other expenses associated with the transaction.
