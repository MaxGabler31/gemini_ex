ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Overview and History



Fuse Group Holding Inc. (the “Company” or “Fuse Group” or “we”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 24, 2013. Fuse Group currently explores opportunities in mining. On December 6, 2016, the Company incorporated Fuse Processing, Inc. (“Processing”) in the State of California. Processing seeks business opportunities in mining and is currently investigating potential mining targets in Asia and North America. Fuse Group is the sole shareholder of Processing. In March 2017, Processing acquired 100% ownership of Fuse Trading Limited (“Trading”) for HKD1 ($0.13). Trading had no operations prior to the acquisition by Processing, and Trading expects to be engaged in mining-related businesses. On May 3, 2018, the Company incorporated Fuse Technology Inc. in the State of Nevada, which changed its name to Fuse Biotech Inc. on November 30, 2020. Fuse Group is the sole shareholder of Fuse Biotech Inc. ("Fuse Biotech”). Fuse Biotech was mainly engaged in IMETAL system development. The Company originally planned to operate IMETAL as a platform to facilitate investment and trade in raw metals, find specialized minerals, exploit these opportunities and issue tokens to be used on the platform, subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Due to the recent development of laws and regulations on token issuance and trading, management discussed with the designer of the platform its function and compliance issues and believed the project has more issues and costs for compliance than originally expected. On December 23, 2019, the Board decided to terminate the IMETAL project. Currently, Fuse Biotech is seeking business opportunities in the biotech area.



Fuse Group and Processing provide consulting services to mining industry clients to find acquisition targets within the parameters set by the clients, when the mine owner is considering selling its mining rights. The services of Fuse Group and Processing include due diligence on the potential mine seller and the mine, such as ownership of the mine and whether the mine meets all operation requirements and/or is currently in operation.



On January 4, 2017, Processing entered into a Consulting and Strategist Agreement with a consulting company for a six-month term. On July 3, 2017, Processing and the consulting company extended the Consulting and Strategist Agreement until January 3, 2018 at no additional cost, and the Agreement was subsequently extended to July 3, 2018. The consultant provides Processing with market research, exploration and advise on business development opportunities in certain countries, and other general business advisory services. Processing paid a deposit of $1,325,000 for the consulting fee, of which, $325,000 was expensed as a consulting fee based on the agreement, and the remaining $1,000,000 of which would have been refunded to the Company if the Company had not made an investment and/or entered into a business relationship in Mexico. The consulting company found acquisition targets for the Company, and on June 22, 2018, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with a seller to purchase concessions rights to five mineral locations located in different areas of Mexico for $1,000,000. Upon execution of the MOU, the Company acquired the exclusive right to purchase the concessions rights to mines from the seller until September 30, 2018. The parties entered into an oral agreement that the Company would pay a purchase price of $1,000,000 to purchase concessions rights to five mineral locations that would be consolidated into a local company in Mexico upon the approval from the Mexican government allowing the transfer of all mining concession to a Mexican company. On February 9, 2021, the Company and Processing entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Choo Keam Hui, Goh Hau Guan, Lim Hui Sing, Teh Boon Nee and Tia Chai Teck (collectively as the “Sellers”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue to the Sellers, in lieu of $1,000,000 in cash, an aggregate of 14,285,715 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Fuse Shares”) in exchange of all the outstanding shares of Portafolio en Investigacion Ambiental S.A. de C.V., a Mexican company that owns concessions rights to five mineral locations.  The five mines have not been explored and have no operations, no existing contracts for the sale of output, no permits or licenses to conduct mining operations. Portafolio only has five concessions to explore for minerals and owns no facilities or equipment. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the surface rights and permits that are necessary to extract the minerals from the areas covered by the concessions. The Company is waiting for the Sellers to complete the transfer process for the equity interest of Portafolio to the Processing to complete the transaction which is subject to the Mexican government approval and has not happened yet.



On April 29, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) to change its name from Fuse Enterprises Inc. to Fuse Group Holding Inc. Also on April 29, 2019, stockholders holding a majority of the Company’s outstanding capital stock approved the Amendment. The Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State for the State of Nevada on April 30, 2019, and became effective on May 13, 2019. On May 29, 2019, the Company changed its trading symbol on OTC Markets from FNST to FUST.

The acquisition was not completed yet and the Fuse Shares were not issued. On September 30, 2021, the Company and Fuse Biotech entered into a Termination Agreement with E-Mo Biotech, the Sellers, effective on September 30, 2021.
