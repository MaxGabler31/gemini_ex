​
Overview of Our Business
​
Axcelis Technologies, Inc. (“Axcelis,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) designs, manufactures and services ion implantation and other processing equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductor chips. We believe that our Purion family of products offers the most innovative implanters available on the market today. We sell to leading semiconductor chip manufacturers worldwide. The ion implantation business represented 97.4% of our revenue in 2021, with the remaining 2.6% of revenue derived from aftermarket sales associated with other legacy processing systems. In addition to equipment, we provide extensive aftermarket lifecycle products and services, including used tools, spare parts, equipment upgrades, maintenance services and customer training.
​
Axcelis’ business commenced in 1978 and its current corporate entity was incorporated in Delaware in 1995. We are headquartered in Beverly, Massachusetts and maintain an internet site at www.axcelis.com. On or through our website, investors may access, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our website and the information contained therein or connected thereto shall not be deemed to be incorporated into this Form 10-K.
​
2021 was an exceptional year for Axcelis despite logistical challenges brought on by the geo-political environment and the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the strength of the overall electronics market and the continued growth of the Purion product family in 2021, we delivered record full year revenue, operating profit and gross margin since becoming an independent public company in 2001. Revenue for 2021 was $662.4 million, an increase of 39.6% from 2020 revenue of $474.6 million. Systems revenue for 2021 was $454.6 million, compared to $293.6 million in 2020. Operating profit was $127.3 million in 2021, compared to $58.0 million in 2020. Gross margin for the year was 43.2% compared to 41.8% in 2020. Net income for the year was $98.7 million, an increase of 97.4% following a 39.6% increase in revenue from the prior year. 
​
The Company is in a strong competitive position as we participate in a period of extended industry growth. A focused strategy on ion implant, combined with the hard work and dedication of our employees and the encouragement and support of our customers and suppliers, enabled us to achieve numerous critical milestones in our drive to market leadership. We were able to rapidly grow our manufacturing and supply chain capabilities through smart capacity planning and execution, including the opening of our new Axcelis Asia Operations Center in South Korea and the expansion of clean manufacturing in Beverly. In 2021, we continued to expand the Purion installed base, growing our large and diverse group of customers, mainly in the mature process technology segment. We continued our focus on the mature process technology segment in 2021, launching new Purion product extensions, including the Purion H200™ high current implanter, targeted for the production of power devices, and the Purion XEmax™ used to manufacture image sensors. Through the introduction of these new products and continuous cost reduction measures, we increased our gross margin year over year, making this the fourth consecutive year with gross margin greater than 40 percent. 
 ​
We continue to work diligently to ensure that manufacturing and operating expense levels remain well aligned to business conditions. We believe that the most fundamental interest of our stockholders is consistent, profitable, financial performance, which we expect to continue to deliver in 2022. Our performance is subject to risks and uncertainties discussed below under Item 1A, Risk Factors.

Industry Overview
​
Semiconductor chips, also known as integrated circuits, are used in a continuously evolving range of consumer and industrial products, including for example, personal computers, mobile devices, automobiles, sensors and controllers for the “internet of things” and data storage servers. Types of semiconductor chips include dynamic random-access memory (“DRAM”) and “Not AND” (“NAND”) Flash memory; logic devices to process information; and “system on chip” devices (which have both logic and memory features). The increased number of devices providing information to and receiving 

2



information from the Internet, sometimes referred to as the “Connected World,” is increasing demand for chips. These chips are used in data input, such as image sensors, which are often manufactured using mature processing technologies, as well as for memory to support the storage of data, internet streaming and “cloud computing” data analytics.
​
Most semiconductor chips are built on silicon wafers of either 200mm (8 inches) or 300mm (12 inches) in diameter. Each semiconductor chip is made up of millions of tiny transistors or “switches” to control the functions of the device. Transistors are created in the silicon wafer by introducing various precisely placed impurities into the silicon in specific patterns. 
​
Semiconductor chip manufacturers own or manage wafer fabrication facilities (often referred to as “fabs”), which utilize many different types of equipment in the making of integrated circuits. Over 300 process steps utilizing over 50 different types of process tools are required to make a single device like a microprocessor. Semiconductor chip manufacturers seek device performance benefits through new products and technology enhancements and productivity improvements through increased throughput, equipment utilization and higher manufacturing yields. Capacity is added by increasing the amount of manufacturing equipment in existing fabrication facilities and by constructing new fabrication facilities. 
​
We have different types of customers, which impacts the timing of purchases and technology requirements. Some customers are integrated electronics manufacturers, making semiconductor chips for their own devices. These same companies may also act as foundries, manufacturing chips for other electronic manufacturers or chip design companies. Some customers only function as foundries. A few companies design and manufacture branded chips that are sold to device manufacturers. In addition, some customers have partnerships or joint ventures with two or more semiconductor chip manufacturers to share the technology development and capital investment. The timing of purchases by foundry customers will depend on their success in securing manufacturing contracts. Also, foundry customers will look for equipment that can deliver the broadest capabilities in order to be prepared to manufacture all chip types, while integrated electronics manufacturers may invest in processing equipment dedicated to a specific application they require for their products.
​
The semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been cyclical as global chip production capacities successively exceed, then lag behind, global chip demand. When chip demand is high, and inventories are low, chip manufacturers add capacity through capital equipment purchases. Given the difficulties of forecasting and calibrating chip demand and production capacity, the industry periodically experiences excess chip inventories and softening chip prices. Device manufacturers react with muted capital spending, lowering the demand for capital equipment. Changes in consumer and business demand for products in which chips are used also affect the industry. A successful semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer must not only provide some of the most technically complex products manufactured in the world but also must manage its business to thrive during low points in the cycle.

​
Ion Implantation Systems
​
Ion implantation is a principal step in the transistor formation cycle of the semiconductor chip manufacturing process. Ion implantation is also used to change the material characteristics of the silicon for reasons other than electrical doping, a process known as “material modification.” An ion implanter is a large, technically advanced system that injects dopants such as arsenic, boron or phosphorus into a wafer. These dopants are ionized and therefore have an electrical charge state. This electric charge state allows the dopants to be accelerated, focused and filtered with electric and magnetic fields. Ion implanters use these fields to create a beam of ions with a precisely defined energy level (ranging between several hundred and eight million electron-volts) and with a precisely defined beam current level (ranging from microamps to milliamps). Certain areas of the silicon wafer are blocked off by a polymer material known as photoresist, which acts as a “stencil” to pattern devices so that the dopants will only enter the wafer where needed. Typical process flows require twenty implant steps, with the most advanced processes requiring thirty or more steps. Each implant step is characterized by four key parameters: dopant type, dose (amount of dopant), energy (depth into the silicon) and tilt/twist (angle of wafer relative to the ion beam).
​
In order to efficiently cover the wide range of implant steps, three different types of implanters have been developed, each targeted at a specific range of applications, primarily defined by dose and energy. The three traditional implanter types are referred to as high current, high energy and medium current:
​

● | High current implanters were the second type of implanter to emerge, having low energy capability and high dose range.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | High energy implanters emerged to address the need for deeper implants with a high energy range and low dose.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Medium current implanters are the original model of ion implanter, with mid to low-range energy and dose capability.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Aftermarket Support and Services
​
Through our CS&I business, we offer our customers extensive aftermarket service and support throughout the lifecycle of the equipment we manufacture. We believe that approximately 2,900 of our products are in use in 28 countries worldwide. The service and support that we provide includes used tools, spare parts, equipment upgrades, and maintenance services. We offer varying levels of sales, service and application support out of our field offices. Revenue generated through our CS&I business represented 31.4%, 38.1% and 40.9% of revenue in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
​
To support our aftermarket business, we have sales and marketing personnel, field service engineers, and spare parts and applications engineers, as well as employees located at our manufacturing facilities who work with our customers to provide customer training and documentation, and product, process and applications support. 
​
Most of our customers maintain spare parts inventories for our machines. In addition to our web-based spare parts management and replenishment tracking program, we offer a number of Business-to-Business options to support our customers’ parts management requirements. Our Axcelis Managed Inventory service offering provides the customer with full spares support through a parts consignment arrangement in which Axcelis retains responsibility for the complete supply chain. These services provide ease of use alternatives that reduce order fulfillment costs and improve cycle time, resulting in an expanded customer base for this service offering.
​
Sales and Marketing
​
We primarily sell our equipment and services through our direct sales force. We conduct sales and marketing activities from our sales offices located in the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, China, Singapore, Japan, Germany and Italy. 
​
International revenue, including export sales from our U.S. manufacturing facilities to foreign customers and sales by foreign subsidiaries and branches, accounted for 92.6%, 89.3% and 89.4% of total revenue in 2021, 2020 and 2019, 

5



respectively. In 2021, 78.4% of our sales were denominated in U.S. dollars. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for a breakdown of our revenue and long-lived assets in the United States, Europe and Asia. See also Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for information about risks attendant to our foreign operations.
​
Customers
​
In 2021, according to Gartner Inc., the top 20 semiconductor chip manufacturers accounted for approximately 92.0% of total semiconductor capital equipment spending, which increased from 90.4% in 2020. These manufacturers are from the largest semiconductor chip manufacturing regions in the world: the United States, Asia Pacific (Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Japan and China) and Europe. 
​
Information on net sales to unaffiliated customers is included in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues from Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation represented 10% or more of consolidated revenues. The loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
​
Research and Development
​
Our industry continues to experience rapid technological change, requiring us to frequently introduce new products and enhancements. Our Beverly, Massachusetts Advanced Technology Center houses a process development laboratory with a 12,500 square feet class 10/100/1000 clean room for product demonstrations and process development and a 34,000 square feet customer training center. The Advanced Technology Center provides infrastructure and process capabilities that allow customers to test their unique process steps on our systems under conditions that substantially replicate the customers’ production environments. This facility also provides significant capability for our research and development efforts.
​
We devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with our customers to remain responsive to their product needs. We have also sought to reduce the development cycle for new products through a collaborative process whereby our engineering, manufacturing and marketing personnel work closely together with one another and with our customers at an earlier stage in the process. We use 3D, computer-aided design, finite element analysis and other computer-based modeling methods to test new designs.
​
Our expenses for research and development were $65.4 million, $61.8 million and $53.9 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, or 9.9%, 13.0% and 15.7% of revenue, respectively. 
​
Manufacturing
​
We manufacture products at our 417,000 square feet ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 certified plant in Beverly, Massachusetts. Our facilities employ best in class manufacturing techniques, including lean manufacturing, six sigma controls and advanced inventory management, purchasing and quality systems.
​
We expanded our manufacturing capabilities in November 2021, with the opening of our new Axcelis Asia Operations Center in South Korea. This facility has 38,000 square feet and is designed to bring production closer to our Asia-based customers, driving customer satisfaction and operating efficiencies. 
​
Our clean manufacturing process uses class 1,000/10,000 space to facilitate most of our manufacturing requirements.
​
Our core competency in manufacturing and supply chain management is built around system assembly and testing, which remains an in-house capability due to the high degree of expertise and intellectual property associated with the process and design. Non-core work is sourced to global partners and includes items such as vacuum systems, wafer handling and commodity-level components. We continuously pursue outsourcing opportunities where the economics are justified, with a goal of enabling quality and margin improvement. Our supply chain team is globally focused and is located 

6



in Beverly and Singapore. Customized and commercially available software solutions drive our planning, purchasing and inventory tracking process.
​
Our products are designed to be assembled and tested in a modular fashion, which facilitates our industry-recognized “ship-from-cell” process. Specially developed test stands, software and tooling provide the framework for this accelerated delivery process. Customers that choose the “ship-from-cell” process substantially improve their delivery times while receiving the same high level of quality provided by more traditional, longer cycle integration techniques. Product margins and inventory turns also improve as a result of shorter factory cycle times and increased labor productivity.
​
Installation of our equipment is provided by factory and field teams. The process includes assembling the equipment at our installation site, and after it has been connected, recalibrating it to factory specifications.
​
Competition
​
The semiconductor equipment industry is highly competitive and is characterized by a small number of participants ranging in size. Significant competitive factors in the semiconductor capital equipment market include price, cost of ownership, equipment performance, customer support, capabilities and breadth of product line. 
​
In ion implantation, we mainly compete against Applied Materials, Inc. Axcelis and Applied Materials are the only ion implant manufacturers with a full range of implant products, as well as service and support infrastructures able to service our customers globally. Other non-U.S. players we compete with include Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ion Technology Co. Ltd. and Nissin Ion Equipment Co., Ltd in Japan, Advanced Ion Beam Technology, Inc. in Taiwan, as well as CETC Electronics Equipment Group Co., Ltd. in the People’s Republic of China. Non-U.S. suppliers may have an advantage over U.S. suppliers established U.S. export controls regulation for shipments to China. 
​
Intellectual Property
​
We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection in the United States and in other countries, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our proprietary rights in our products and our business. As of December 31, 2021, we had 214 active patents issued in the United States and 438 active patents granted in other countries, as well as 226 patent applications (25 in the United States and 201 in other countries) on file with various patent agencies worldwide. Patents are generally in effect for up to 20 years from the filing of the application.
​
We intend to file additional patent applications and grow our intellectual property portfolio as appropriate. Although patents are important to our business, we do not believe that we are substantially dependent on any single patent or any group of patents.
​
We have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that are maintained to provide customer recognition for our products in the marketplace. Trademark registrations generally remain in effect as long as the trademarks are in use. From time to time, we enter into license agreements with third parties under which we obtain or grant rights to patented or proprietary technology. We do not believe that any of our licenses are currently material to us. 
​
Backlog
​
Systems backlog, including deferred systems revenue, was $460.6 million and $116.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We believe it is meaningful to investors to include deferred systems revenue as part of our backlog. Deferred systems revenue represents revenue that will be recognized in future periods based on prior shipments or customer prepayments. Our policy is to include in backlog only those system orders for which we have accepted purchase orders. All orders are subject to cancellations or rescheduling by customers with limited or no penalties.
​

7



Backlog does not include orders received and fulfilled within a quarter. Our backlog at the beginning of a quarter typically does not include all orders required to achieve our sales objectives for that quarter. Backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future business trends because orders for services or parts received during the quarter are generally performed or shipped within the same quarter.
​
Bookings in the quarter ended December 31, 2021 were $194.0 million compared to $131.5 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2020.
​
Human Capital 
​
As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,122 employees and 73 temporary staff worldwide, of which 831 work in North America, 301 in Asia and 63 in Europe. During 2021, our headcount increased by approximately 14% to support our increased business during the year. While the majority of our headcount is based in the U.S. at our main manufacturing facility in Beverly, MA, our business requires our presence where our customers are located around the world, resulting in Axcelis employees working in 28 different countries.
​
Our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country and region) include cash incentive programs and recognition bonuses, equity awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) plan with a competitive employer match, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, employee assistance programs, and tuition assistance. These programs all contribute to both attracting and retaining a highly skilled employee base, including those with critical leadership and industry skills and experience.
​
During 2021, our voluntary turnover rate for employees was 8.1%, or 6.9% without retirements, well below the worldwide technology industry (all reported) average of 18.2% reported in the Aon 2021 Salary Increase and Turnover Study — Second Edition, September 2021.
​
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to health and wellness insurance and programs that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having those employees that could productively work from home continue to do so, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
​
Axcelis is dedicated to building a diverse workforce, fostering a culture built on the principle of inclusion, and maintaining a workplace free from discrimination. We strongly believe that a diversity of experience, perspectives and backgrounds will lead to a better environment for our employees and better products for our customers. Axcelis’ commitment to diversity extends to our Board of Directors, our leadership team and all teams and functions across our global locations. 
​
We encourage you to review the “Focus on Diversity” report (located in the “Investors” and “About Us” sections of our Axcelis.com website) for more detailed information regarding diversity and inclusion at Axcelis. Nothing on our website, including our Focus on Diversity Report or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.
​
Environmental
​
We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate that regulate, among other things: air emissions; water discharges; and the generation, use, storage, transportation, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes produced by our manufacturing, research and development and sales activities. As with other companies engaged in like businesses, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of environmental liabilities, claims, penalties and orders.
