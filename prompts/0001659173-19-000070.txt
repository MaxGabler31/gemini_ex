The Company, through ATI Modular, is engaged in the development and the exporting of modular energy efficient technology and processes that allow government and private enterprises in China and elsewhere to use US-based methods for creating modular spaces, facilities, and properties. The Company is in the business of all aspects of modular and smart construction, including but not limited to, (a) the furtherance of modular and smart construction technology, education, development and production in developed and undeveloped countries, (b) acquisition and/or installation of construction equipment, materials, furnishings, hardware, insulation, flooring, roofing, wiring, plumbing, heating and air conditioning, and landscaping, (c) solar energy, and (d) other businesses directly or tangentially related to these lines of services, including assisting businesses and entrepreneurs in securing naming, licensing or promotional rights, driving internet and media traffic, increasing visibility of product and name recognition, and other services. The Company has not earned revenues from these operations.
 
The Company, through AmericaTowne, is pursuing its objectives in providing upper and middle-income consumers in China with “Made in the USA” goods and services allowing such consumers to experience United States’ culture and lifestyle. The pursuit of these objectives will continue to be done through AmericaTowne, as an assumed name of the Company. In addition, the Company believes it has made significant progress in developing its business platform in Africa by implementing business and commerce solutions considered mainstream in America, but relatively new in these developing countries. The Company’s recent developments in Africa have been highlighted through numerous contractual disclosures on EDGAR. The Company intends on continuing to deploy resources, research and expertise in evaluating further opportunities in developing countries as part of its overall growth model. The Company has not earned revenues from these operations.
 
The Company is pursuing exportation and procurement of goods to African countries. As stated in its 2018 periodic disclosures, the Company has entered into definitive procurement agreements with the following governmental entities in Kenya, Africa pursuant to the specific bid and approval procedures set forth by the particular administrative body for the governmental entity identified: (a) Siaya, (b) Busia, (c) Turkana, (d) Vihiga, (e) Kakamega, (f) Kisumu (g) Migori, and (h) Kericho. For example, most of the agreements disclosed by the Company are defined as “tenders,” or perhaps commonly referred to as “invoicing agreements,” where the scope of services and goods to be procured are set forth in governmental approval correspondence following meeting minutes, planning orders or committee hearings. The tenders were subsequently delivered to the Company for invoicing. Following invoicing, the governmental entity has a set period of time to pay under the invoice prior to performance of services by the Company. During the invoicing period, the Company prepares its staff and independent contractors to procure the proper goods or services required under the tender. The payment terms and conditions are set forth in the specific tenders, and thus the reader is directed to the agreements enclosed in the Company’s 2018 periodic filings for review. None of the specific tenders have been paid to the Company, but the Company believes that the agreements with the governmental entities above are valid, and are in the process of payment.
 
The Company believes a material definitive agreement exists as a result of the issuance of invoices identified above. There are no pre-existing relationships between the Company (or its assumed name entities – AmericaTowne or ATI Modular, or its related company, ATI Nationwide Holding Corp.) and the governmental entity issuing the tender, unless previously disclosed. The even-numbered invoices set forth in the periodic disclosures, e.g. 1134, 1136, etc., following the preceding odd-numbered invoice have been prepared for the second required payment under the tenders, but not issued as of the date of the Company’s periodic disclosure in July of 2018. The Company has not, and cannot, guarantee the collectability of these invoices or any subsequent invoice issued against the above-referenced tenders, or any future tender or similar agreement with the same or other governmental entities. 
 
Certain aspects of the export services engaged in by the Company, such as tax incentives and tax reductions for export actions, cannot be provided by the Company because it is not an Interest Charge Domestic International Sales Corporation (“IC-DISC”). Therefore, the Company has entered into a separate agreement with AXP Holding Corporation, a IC-DISC corporation controlled by Mr. Perkins. The term of the agreement is six years and allows the Company, based on its exporting activities, to save and or reduce its tax obligations. Although other similar IC-DISC entities exist, the Company is able to obtain better terms and conditions from AXP Holding Corporation in light of Mr. Perkins’ control of AXP Holding Corporation  .

Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. We shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:
 
(a) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every 5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more;
 
(b) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective IPO registration statement;
 
(c) the date on which such issuer has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or
 
(d) the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a ‘large accelerated filer’, as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto.
 
As an emerging growth company we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.
 
As an emerging growth company we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
