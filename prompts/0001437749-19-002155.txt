Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on November 13, 2017 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more target businesses (a “Business Combination). We intend to focus our search for a target business in the energy industry, with an emphasis on opportunities in the upstream oil and gas industry in North America where our management team’s networks and experience are suited, although our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region. We have reviewed, and continue to review, a number of opportunities to enter into a Business Combination, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete a Business Combination with any of the target businesses we have reviewed or with any other target business. We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
 
In connection with the organization of the Company, a total of 10,062,500 shares of Class B common stock were sold to the Sponsor at a price of approximately $0.002 per share for an aggregate of $25,000 (the "Founders' Shares"). In March 2018, our Sponsor returned to us, at no cost, an aggregate of 1,437,500 Founders’ Shares, which we cancelled, leaving an aggregate of 8,625,000 Founders’ Shares outstanding. In March 2018, our Sponsor transferred 40,000 Founders’ Shares to each of our three independent director nominees resulting in a total of 120,000 Founders’ Shares transferred to our independent director nominees. In April 2018, we effected a stock dividend of 0.2 shares of Class B common stock for each outstanding share of Class B common stock, resulting in our Sponsor and independent director nominees holding an aggregate of 10,350,000 Founders’ Shares. At December 31, 2018, our Sponsor and our three independent directors (the “Initial Stockholders”) held, collectively, 10,350,000 Founders’ Shares.
 
On April 17, 2018 (the “IPO Closing Date”), the Company consummated its initial public offering (“Public Offering”) of 41,400,000 units, representing a complete exercise of the over-allotment option, at a purchase price of $10.00 per unit generating gross proceeds of $414,000,000 before underwriting discounts and expenses. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock (“Public Share”) of the Company at $0.0001 par value and one half of one warrant (a "Unit"). Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 (a “Warrant”). Only whole Warrants may be exercised and no fractional Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Warrants may be traded. Each Warrant will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of an initial Business Combination or 12 months from the IPO Closing Date and will expire on the fifth anniversary of our completion of an initial Business Combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.  Alternatively, if we do not complete a Business Combination within 18 months of the IPO Closing Date, the Warrants will expire at the end of such period. If we are unable to deliver registered shares of Class A common stock to the holder upon exercise of Warrants issued in connection with the 41,400,000 Units during the exercise period, the Warrants will expire worthless, except to the extent that they may be exercised on a cashless basis in the circumstances described in the agreement governing the Warrants.
 
 On the IPO Closing Date, our Sponsor purchased from us an aggregate of 10,280,000 private placement warrants at $1.00 per private placement warrant (for a total purchase price of $10,280,000) in a private placement (the “Private Placement Warrants”). Each Private Placement Warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50, and are not redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers of the Private Placement Warrants or their permitted transferees. We received gross proceeds from the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants of $414,000,000 and $10,280,000, respectively, for an aggregate of $424,280,000. We deposited $414,000,000 of the gross proceeds in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the “Trust Account”). The proceeds held in the Trust Account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of one hundred eighty (180) days or less or in money market funds that meet certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Act of 1940 and invest only in direct U.S. government obligations. At the IPO Closing Date, the remaining $10,280,000 was held outside of the Trust Account, of which $8,280,000 was used to pay underwriting discounts and $200,000 was used to repay notes payable to our Sponsor with the balance reserved to pay accrued offering and formation costs, business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. A portion of interest income on the funds held in the Trust Account has been and will continue to be released to us to pay our tax obligations and up to $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support.
 
On April 12, 2018, HighPeak LP, an affiliate of our Sponsor, entered into a forward purchase agreement (the “forward purchase agreement”) with us that provides for the purchase by HighPeak LP of an aggregate of up to 15,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock (the “forward purchase shares”) and 7,500,000 warrants for $10.00 per forward purchase unit, for an aggregate purchase price of up to $150,000,000 in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of our initial Business Combination (the “Forward Purchase Securities”). HighPeak LP is a limited partnership affiliated with our Sponsor. The warrants sold pursuant to the forward purchase agreement (the “forward purchase warrants”) will have the same terms as the Private Placement Warrants so long as they are held by HighPeak LP, its affiliates or its permitted transferees, and the forward purchase shares are identical to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units sold in the Public Offering, except the forward purchase shares are subject to transfer restrictions and certain registration rights, as described in the forward purchase agreement. HighPeak LP's commitment under the forward purchase agreement may be reduced under certain circumstances as described in the agreement.

On May 25, 2018, we announced the holders of our Units may elect to separately trade the Public Shares and Warrants included in the Units commencing on May 29, 2018 on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbols “PACQ” and “PACQW,” respectively. Those Units not separated continue to trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol “PACQU”.
 
We believe our management team is well positioned to identify attractive risk-adjusted returns in the marketplace and our contacts and transaction sources, ranging from industry executives, private owners, private equity funds, and investment bankers in addition to the extensive global industry and geographical reach of our affiliates, will enable us to pursue a broad range of opportunities. Our management believes its ability to identify and implement value creation initiatives has been an essential driver of past performance and will remain central to its differentiated acquisition strategy.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial Business Combination, build a company in the energy industry that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from the application of their operational control. Our acquisition strategy will leverage our team’s network of potential proprietary and public transaction sources where we believe a combination of our relationships, and knowledge and experience in the energy industry could effect a positive transformation or augmentation of existing businesses or properties to improve their overall value proposition.
 
We plan to utilize the network and energy industry experience of our management team in seeking an initial Business Combination and employing our acquisition strategy. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and their affiliates have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships we believe will serve as a useful source of acquisition opportunities. We expect these networks will provide our management team with a robust flow of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate target asset and/or target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, which may include investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Members of our management team will continue to communicate with their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for target assets and/or companies and a potential Business Combination, and continue the process of pursuing and reviewing opportunities with value creation potential.
 
The primary strategies our management team will use to identify a potential Business Combination to generate favorable returns include seeking to:
 

• | acquire and operate quality, producing assets with a large oil and gas reserve base with production, proved reserve and cash flow upside.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide development capital and expertise to partner with companies (including majors and large-cap independents) with high quality assets and core acreage positions at attractive economics.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | leverage proved developed reserves while targeting multiple productive pay zones to increase upside potential.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe our key differentiators include:
 

• | our team’s operating and technical experience in horizontal drilling and completion techniques, seismic interpretation, acquisition evaluation, financial structuring, operational efficiencies, full-cycle economics and the value creation methods to optimize production, proved oil and gas reserves, and cash flow;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our management team is differentiated in its ability to economically, efficiently and consistently obtain the needed services for its properties (or projects) in varying market environments;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our management team has experience in the safe and environmentally-sound drilling practices and production operations, the marketing of hydrocarbons and the implementation of hedging programs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cumulatively, our team has managed tens of thousands of producing wells, drilled and completed thousands of horizontal wells and is widely regarded in the industry as prudent operators and partners.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Criteria
 
We have identified the following general criteria and guidelines we believe are important in evaluating prospective targets. We intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial Business Combination with a target that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire a target business we believe:

• | is fundamentally sound but we believe can achieve better results by leveraging the operating and financial experience of our management team and their affiliates;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | can utilize the extensive networks and insights our management team has built in the energy industry;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | is at an inflection point, such as requiring additional management expertise, are able to innovate through new operational techniques, or where we believe we can drive improved financial performance;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | exhibits unrecognized value or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital, and a need for capital to achieve the Company’s growth strategy, that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | will offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We will seek to acquire the target on terms and in a manner that leverages our management team’s investment experience within the energy industry. Potential upside from growth in the target business and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks designed to balance capital preservation with value creation.
 
Subject to the limitations a target business having a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial Business Combination, as described below in more detail, and that we must acquire a controlling interest in the target business, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. Except for the general criteria and guidelines set forth above under the caption “Acquisition Criteria,” we have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:
 

• | financial condition and results of operation;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | growth potential;
--+------------------


• | brand recognition and potential;
--+---------------------------------


• | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | capital requirements;
--+----------------------


• | competitive position;
--+----------------------


• | barriers to entry;
--+-------------------


• | stage of development of the products, processes or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 
 7




• | existing distribution and potential for expansion;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | impact of regulation on the business;
--+--------------------------------------


• | regulatory environment of the industry;
--+----------------------------------------


• | costs associated with effecting the Business Combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial Business Combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a Business Combination consistent with our business objectives. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the Business Combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a Business Combination.
 
To the extent we effect our initial Business Combination with a financially unstable company or entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
Our Acquisition Process
 
We expect to conduct a refined, systematic and disciplined approach with respect to evaluating prospective target assets and/or target businesses for our initial Business Combination.
 
After progressing past an initial screening, prospective targets will be subjected to a thorough due diligence process. We expect this review will be performed by our experienced management team. The due diligence process examines all important aspects of a prospective target acquisition in detail, with particular attention focused on the proved reserve asset base, production enhancement plans and strategic financial plans, including risk mitigation tools. During our review process of target assets and/or companies for a Business Combination, our management team will thoroughly review all aspects of the target business, including, as applicable: (i) production rates and ultimate recoverable reserves; (ii) risk profiles of the assets including, but not limited to, an analysis of concentration, reservoir peculiarities, geologic conditions, operational, environmental, health, safety, and other related risks; (iii) lease operating costs and overhead expenses; (iv) historical oil and gas prices and related “basis” risk relative to geographic location and quality of the oil or gas; (v) other potential burdens or benefits to future cash flow, including contingent liabilities; and (vi) any special tax consequences of the transaction. Our management team has reviewed numerous transactions annually and, consequently, we believe their operating experience and contacts enable them to efficiently identify those target opportunities which have the highest probability of successful value creation.

We believe there are numerous acquisition candidates based on our management’s business knowledge and past experience. We expect our principal means of identifying potential target businesses will be through the extensive contacts and relationships of our Sponsor, officers and directors. While our officers and directors are not required to commit any specific amount of time in identifying or performing due diligence on potential target businesses, our officers and directors believe the relationships they have developed over their careers and their access to our Sponsor’s contacts and resources will generate a number of potential Business Combination opportunities that will warrant further investigation. We also anticipate target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our Sponsor, officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. They must present to us all target business opportunities that have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding taxes payable on the income accrued in the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination, subject to any pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial Business Combination with or from a company affiliated with, or involving properties operated by, our Sponsor or its affiliates or its officers or directors; nor are we prohibited from entering into an agreement with our Sponsor or its affiliates or a company affiliated with our officers or directors with respect to the operation of any properties we acquire in connection with the initial Business Combination. In the event we seek to complete our initial Business Combination with a company affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, may obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Through their direct or indirect interest in a HighPeak affiliated company, members of our management team currently own an indirect interest in us. Each member of our management team may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial Business Combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular Business Combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial Business Combination. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – We may engage in a Business Combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with or are affiliated with our Sponsor, officers, directors or existing holders which may raise potential conflicts of interest.”
 
As more fully discussed in “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance”, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a Business Combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity.
 
Potential Conflicts
 
Each of our officers and our directors other than our independent directors is an officer and/or director of our Sponsor and/or an affiliated company. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial Business Combination with or from a company affiliated with, or involving properties operated by, our Sponsor or its affiliates or its officers or directors; nor are we prohibited from entering into an agreement with our Sponsor or its affiliates or a company affiliated with our officers or directors with respect to the operation of any properties we acquire in connection with the initial Business Combination. In the event we seek to complete our initial Business Combination with a company affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, may obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial Business Combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view. Through their direct or indirect interest in a HighPeak affiliated company, members of our management team currently own an indirect interest in us. Each member of our management team may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial Business Combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular Business Combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial Business Combination.
 
All of the members of our management team are employed by a HighPeak affiliate and are direct investors in a HighPeak affiliate. HighPeak is continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a Business Combination. Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a Business Combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a Business Combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such other entity. We do not believe, however, the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our Business Combination. In addition, we may, at our option, pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity with an entity to which an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation, including a HighPeak affiliate. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial Business Combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by making a specified future issuance to any such entity. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to our Sponsor or its affiliates or our non-employee directors or their affiliates unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our Company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.

Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial Business Combination or we have failed to complete our initial Business Combination within 18 months after the IPO Closing Date.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
Our initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow, proved oil and gas reserves, oil and gas production, oil and gas lease acreage and/or book value). Even though our board of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able independently to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we may obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Except as required by applicable law, our stockholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion and may not be permitted to rely on such opinion.
 
We may pursue an acquisition opportunity jointly with HighPeak LP or one or more other entities affiliated with HighPeak LP which we refer to as an “Affiliated Joint Acquisition.” Any such parties may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial Business Combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to such parties a class of equity or equity-linked securities. We refer to this potential future issuance, or a similar issuance to other specified purchasers, as a “specified future issuance” throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any such Affiliated Joint Acquisition or specified future issuance would be in addition to, and would not include, the securities issued pursuant to the forward purchase agreement. The amount and other terms and conditions of any such specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof. We are not obligated to make any specified future issuance and may determine not to do so. This is not an offer for any specified future issuance. Pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of our Founders’ Shares, any such specified future issuance would result in an adjustment to the conversion ratio such that our Initial Stockholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate percentage ownership at 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of Class A common stock issued pursuant to our Public Offering plus all shares issued in the specified future issuance, unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Founders’ Shares agreed to waive such adjustment with respect to the specified future issuance at the time thereof. We cannot determine at this time whether a majority of the holders of our Founders’ Shares at the time of any such specified future issuance would agree to waive such adjustment to the conversion ratio. If such adjustment is not waived, the specified future issuance would not reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Founders’ Shares, but would reduce the percentage ownership of the holders of Class A common stock, other than Founders’ Shares, issued pursuant to the Public Offering. If such adjustment is waived, the specified future issuance would reduce the percentage ownership of holders of Class A common stock issued pursuant to our Public Offering and of the holders of the Founders’ Shares. The issuance of the securities issued pursuant to the forward purchase agreement will not result in such an adjustment to the conversion ratio of our Founders’ Shares.
 
We currently anticipate structuring a Business Combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial Business Combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, including an Affiliated Joint Acquisition, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. If the Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial Business Combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.

Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive Business Combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other Business Combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses might find this method a more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely not be present to the same extent in connection with a Business Combination with us. Furthermore, once the Business Combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests than it would have as a privately-held company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
While we believe our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a Business Combination with a more established entity or with a private company. These inherent limitations include limitations on our available financial resources, which may be inferior to those of other entities pursuing the acquisition of similar target businesses; the requirement that we seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer in relation thereto, which may delay the consummation of a transaction; and the existence of our outstanding warrants, which may represent a source of future dilution.
 
Financial Position
 
With funds in the Trust Account of approximately $414.0 million available to use for a Business Combination (assuming no stockholder seeks conversion of their shares or seeks to sell their shares to us in any tender offer in relation to such Business Combination), we offer a target business a variety of options such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our initial Business Combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing, other than the forward purchase agreement, and there can be no assurance that it will be available to us.
Effecting our Initial Business Combination
 
We will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of our proposed Business Combination or allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial Business Combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial Business Combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination.
 
We have until the close of October 16, 2019 which is 18 months from the IPO Closing Date to consummate an initial Business Combination. If we are unable to consummate an initial Business Combination within such time period, we will redeem 100% of our outstanding Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to applicable law and as further described herein, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. We expect the pro rata redemption price to be approximately $10.00 per share of Class A common stock, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders.
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, proceeds from the forward purchase agreement, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial Business Combination. We may seek to complete our initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
 11



If our initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial Business Combination, and we may effectuate our initial Business Combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account. In the case of an initial Business Combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the Business Combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or applicable stock exchange rules, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial Business Combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
 
Lack of Business Diversification
 
We may seek to effect a Business Combination with more than one target business, and there is no required minimum valuation standard for any single target at the time of such acquisition. We expect to complete only a single Business Combination, although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating businesses. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several Business Combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a Business Combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

• | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a Business Combination, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the Business Combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.
 
Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 
Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a Business Combination, we cannot assure you our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a Business Combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a Business Combination, it is unlikely they will devote their full-time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a Business Combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the Company after the consummation of a Business Combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the Business Combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the Business Combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the Company after the consummation of the Business Combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the Company after the consummation of a Business Combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential Business Combination. Additionally, we cannot assure you our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
Following a Business Combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination
 
In connection with any proposed Business Combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed Business Combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. For instance, Nasdaq rules currently allow us to engage in a tender offer in lieu of a stockholder meeting but would still require us to obtain stockholder approval if we were seeking to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares to a target business as consideration in any Business Combination.  Therefore, if we were structuring a Business Combination that required us to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares, we would seek stockholder approval of such Business Combination instead of conducting a tender offer. We will consummate our initial Business Combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination.
Conversion Rights for Public Stockholders
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial Business Combination, public stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our Class A common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.
 
Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold, except in no event will we redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (such that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). As a result, we may be able to complete our Business Combination even though a substantial majority of our public stockholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the Business Combination or redeem any shares, all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate Business Combination. Our Sponsor and our officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any Founders’ Shares or Class A common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to our Public Offering or purchased by them in our Public Offering or in the aftermarket.
 
We may require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the Business Combination.
 
 13



There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights prior to the consummation of the proposed Business Combination and the proposed Business Combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
 
Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to stockholders in connection with a vote for any proposed Business Combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the Business Combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. Please see the risk factor titled “In connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial Business Combination, we may require stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed Business Combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights” for further information on the risks of failing to comply with these requirements.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures historically used by some blank check companies. Traditionally, to perfect conversion rights in connection with a blank check company’s Business Combination, the company would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial Business Combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed Business Combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his conversion rights. After the Business Combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the Business Combination during which he could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the conversion price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the conversion rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become a “continuing” right surviving past the consummation of the Business Combination until the holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a holder’s election to convert his shares is irrevocable once the Business Combination is approved.
 
Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed Business Combination or the expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a Public Share of Class A common stock delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
 
Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
 
Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides we have 18 months from the IPO Closing Date to complete an initial Business Combination. If we have not completed an initial Business Combination by such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including any interest not previously released to us but net of taxes payable and up to $50,000 for dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
 
 14



Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed they will not propose any amendment to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a Business Combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete a Business Combination within 18 months from the IPO Closing Date unless (i) we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their shares of Class A common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest not previously released to us but net of franchise and income taxes payable and up to $50,000 for dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares and (ii) our Sponsor or an affiliate offers to purchase, at $1.00 per public Warrant (exclusive of commissions), the outstanding public Warrants in a tender offer, as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These rights shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding Public Shares in the event we do not complete our initial Business Combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our Public Shares in the event we do not complete our initial Business Combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete a Business Combination within the prescribed time frame, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including any interest but net of franchise and income taxes payable and up to $50,000 for dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our Public Shares as soon as reasonably possible following 18 months from the IPO Closing Date, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.
 
We are required to use our reasonable best efforts to have all third parties (other than our independent auditors) and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust Account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood any claim would result in any liability extending to the Trust Account. We therefore believe any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you of this fact as there is no guarantee vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the Trust Account. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the Trust Account could be less than $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate sum equal to the amount in the Trust Account, inclusive of any interest, plus any remaining net assets (subject to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors as described herein).
 
 15



Our Sponsor has agreed it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or by a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.00 per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our Company. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
We anticipate notifying the trustee of the Trust Account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate such distribution. The holders of the Founders’ Shares have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to such Founders’ Shares. There will be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless. We will pay any additional liquidation costs from our remaining assets outside of the Trust Account. If we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination and expend all of the net proceeds of our Public Offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the initial per-share redemption price would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.
 
Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only in the event of our failure to complete a Business Combination within the required time period, if the stockholders seek to have us convert or purchase their respective shares upon a Business Combination which is actually completed by us or upon certain amendments to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation prior to consummating an initial Business Combination. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account.
 
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us and is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00 per share.
 
Tender Offer for Public Warrants by our Sponsor or an Affiliate
 
Our Sponsor has committed to offer or cause an affiliate to offer to purchase, at $1.00 per public Warrant (exclusive of commissions), the outstanding public Warrants in a tender offer that would commence after our announcement of an initial Business Combination and occur in connection with such Business Combination. The warrant tender offer would not be conditioned upon any minimum number of Warrants being tendered.
 
Our Sponsor has also committed to offer or cause an affiliate to offer to purchase, at $1.00 per public Warrant (exclusive of commissions), the outstanding public Warrants in a tender offer that would commence after our filing of a proxy statement or information statement with respect to a proposed amendment to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance of timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete a Business Combination within 18 months from the IPO Closing Date. Any such purchases would occur in connection with the effectiveness of such amendment.
 
An affiliate of our Sponsor has deposited cash funds equal to $20,700,000 with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. The funds held in the escrow account may be used to pay $1.00 per Warrant to holders of public Warrants (excluding Private Placement Warrants or forward purchase warrants) that tender in the tender offer for the public Warrants. At any time, our Sponsor or its affiliate may substitute a letter of credit from a financially capable bank in good standing in lieu of cash or cash in lieu of a letter of credit. Neither funds in the escrow account nor the letter of credit shall be held in trust nor comprise any portion of any pro-rata distribution of our Trust Account. In the event a Business Combination is announced and a tender offer for the Warrants is made, but the Business Combination is later abandoned, the tender offer will not be closed, and the Warrants will be returned to the holders.
 
 16



In the event that we are unable to close a Business Combination within the required time, the escrow agent will be authorized to transfer $1.00 per whole public Warrant, to holders of public Warrants other than our Sponsor and its affiliates, at the same time as we redeem our Public Shares, and all public Warrants will expire worthless.
 
Following the tender offer or payment to holders of public Warrants described above, any amounts remaining in the escrow account will be returned to our Sponsor or its affiliate.
 
Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our Public Offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial Business Combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a majority of our stockholders. If we seek to amend any provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a Business Combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete a Business Combination within 18 months from the IPO Closing Date, we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their Public Shares in connection with any such vote. This conversion right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any Founders’ Shares and any Public Shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

• | we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we will consummate our initial Business Combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if our initial Business Combination is not consummated within 18 months from the IPO Closing Date, we will redeem all of the outstanding Public Shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve our Company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we may not consummate any other Business Combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial Business Combination; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | prior to our initial Business Combination, we may not issue additional stock that participates in any manner in the proceeds of the Trust Account, or that votes as a class with the common stock sold in our Public Offering on an initial Business Combination.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting Business Combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses we could acquire with the net proceeds of our Public Offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

• | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our obligation to convert or repurchase shares of Class A common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a Business Combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the anti-dilution rights the Founders’ Shares have upon the issuance of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities in connection with a Business Combination
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our obligation to pay Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. and EarlyBirdCapital a fee of 3.5% of the gross proceeds of our Public Offering upon consummation of our initial Business Combination; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 17



Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a Business Combination. Our management believes, however, our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting a Business Combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you, subsequent to a Business Combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Facilities
 
We currently maintain our principal executive offices at 421 W. 3rd Street, Suite 1000, Fort Worth, Texas 76102. We consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers, adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the Business Combination and the stage of the Business Combination process the Company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the Business Combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a Business Combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
Our Units, Class A common stock and Warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and as a result we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at: http://www.sec.gov. The contents of these websites are not incorporated into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to the uniform resource locators (“URLs”) for these websites are intended to be inactive textual references only.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), or International Financing Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2019 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). In the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer as of December 31, 2019, we will be required to have our internal control procedures audited beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2020. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such target business to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete a business acquisition with such a target business.  
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
