 Item 1.    Business 
   Overview 
         We are a fully integrated provider of high-speed data ("HSD"), cable television ("Video"), and voice over IP-based telephony ("Telephony") services to residential customers and offer a full range of products and services to business customers. Led by our robust HSD offering, our products are available either as a bundle or as an individual service to residential and business service customers. Our service area includes approximately 3.1 million homes and businesses in nineteen Midwestern and Southeastern markets in the United States. In the Midwest, the Company offers services in Detroit and Lansing, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio; Evansville, Indiana and Baltimore, Maryland. The Southeastern markets include Augusta, Columbus, Newnan and West Point, Georgia; Charleston, South Carolina; Dothan, Auburn, Huntsville and Montgomery, Alabama; Knoxville, Tennessee; and Panama City and Pinellas County, Florida. 
         Since commencing operations in 2001, our focus has been to offer a competitive alternative cable service and establish a brand with a strong market position. We have built our business through i) organic subscriber growth and increased penetration within our existing markets and footprint, ii) network expansion to grow our footprint, iii) upgrades to introduce enhanced broadband services to networks we have acquired, iv) entry into business services, with a full range of HSD, Video and Telephony products, and v) acquisitions and integration of cable systems. At December 31, 2017, our networks passed 3,109 thousand homes and businesses and served 777 thousand total customers, reflecting a total customer penetration rate of approximately 25%. 
         We operate primarily in economically stable suburbs that are adjacent to large metropolitan areas as well as secondary and tertiary markets, which we believe have favorable competitive and demographic profiles and include businesses operating across a range of industries. We benefit from the ability to augment our footprint by pursuing value-accretive network extensions, or edge-outs, to increase our addressable market and grow our customer base. We have historically made selective capital investments in edge-outs to facilitate growth in residential and business services. 
         We are focused on efficient capital spending and maximizing adjusted earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") through an Internet-centric growth strategy while maintaining a profitable video subscriber base. Based on our per subscriber economics, we believe that HSD represents the greatest opportunity to enhance profitability across our residential and business markets. We believe that our advanced network is designed to meet our current and future customers' HSD needs. We will offer HSD speeds up to 1 GIG (1000 Mbps) in 95% of our markets by the end of the first quarter 2018. 
         Our most significant competitors are other cable television operators, direct broadcast satellite providers and certain telephone companies that offer services that provide features and functionality similar to our HSD, Video and Telephony services. We believe that our strategy of operating primarily in suburban areas provides better operating and financial stability compared to the more competitive environments in large metropolitan markets. We have a history of successfully competing in chosen markets despite the presence of competing incumbent providers through attractive high value bundling of our services and investments in new service offerings. 
         We believe our high-value product offerings, customer-centric operating philosophy, technically advanced network and experienced management team have driven strong operating and financial performance. Our reputation as an industry leader, particularly with respect to customer experience, has been consistently recognized by independent third parties. For example, WOW has been recognized by Consumer Reports Magazine (rated highest across several categories 15 times in the last 9 years) and J.D. Power and Associates (highest customer satisfaction 21 times in the last 13 years).

     Ownership and Basis of Presentation 
         We commenced operations in 2001 as WideOpenWest, LLC. WideOpenWest, LLC was wholly owned by WideOpenWest Kite, Inc., which was wholly owned by Racecar Acquisition, LLC ("Racecar Acquisition"). Racecar Acquisition was a wholly owned subsidiary of WideOpenWest Holdings, LLC ("Parent"). 
         WideOpenWest, Inc. was organized in Delaware in July 2012 as WideOpenWest Kite, Inc. WideOpenWest Kite, Inc. subsequently changed its name to WideOpenWest, Inc. in March 2017. 
         On April 1, 2016, we consummated a restructuring ("Restructuring") whereby WideOpenWest Finance, LLC ("WOW Finance") became a wholly owned subsidiary of WOW. Previously, WOW Finance was owned by WideOpenWest Illinois, Inc., WideOpenWest Ohio, Inc., WideOpenWest Cleveland, Inc., WOW Sigecom, Inc. and WOW (collectively, the "Members"). Prior to the Restructuring, the Members were wholly owned subsidiaries of Racecar Acquisition. 
         As a result of the Restructuring, each of the Members, other than WOW, merged with and into WOW. WOW became the sole subsidiary of Racecar Acquisition and WOW Finance became a wholly owned subsidiary of WOW. 
         On May 25, 2017, we completed an initial public offering ("IPO"), whereby we registered shares of our common stock, which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the ticker symbol "WOW". Prior to our IPO, WOW was wholly owned by Racecar Acquisition, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent. Subsequent to the IPO, Racecar Acquisition and Parent were liquidated and our shares distributed to their respective members. In the following context, the terms "we", "us", "WOW", or "the Company" may refer, as the context requires, to WOW or, collectively, WOW and its subsidiaries. 
         Certain employees of WOW participated in equity plans administered by the Company's former Parent. The management units from the equity plan were issued from the former Parent's ownership structure, the management units' value directly correlated to the results of WOW, as the primary asset of the former Parent's investment in WOW. The management units for the equity plan have been "pushed down" to the Company, as the management units had been utilized as equity-based compensation for WOW management. Immediately prior to the Company's IPO, these management units were cancelled. For information regarding securities issued under our equity compensation plans, see Note 18 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "Part IIÂ—Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". 
   Stock Repurchase Program 
         On December 14, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock. As of March 9, 2018, we purchased 4.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $41.4 million. We had remaining board authority to purchase an additional $8.6 million of our common stock. We expect the stock repurchase program to deliver value to shareholders, while capitalizing on attractive market valuations. 
 Avista and Crestview Partners Investment 
         On December 18, 2015, Crestview Advisors, LLC ("Crestview") and our former Parent consummated a transaction whereby Crestview became the beneficial owner of approximately 35% of the equity interests of our former Parent. Under terms of the agreement ("Crestview Purchase Agreement"), Crestview's funds purchased units held by Avista Capital Partners ("Avista") and other unit holders, and separately made a $125.0 million primary investment in newly-issued units. 
 5

           On April 29, 2016, funds managed by Avista and Crestview made an additional $40.0 million investment in newly-issued membership units in our former Parent. 
         As of December 31, 2017, all the proceeds from the funds' investments of Avista and Crestview in the amount of $143.3 million, net of transaction costs, have been contributed to the Company. 
   Redemption of 10.25% Senior Notes 
         On March 20, 2017, we utilized cash on hand to redeem $95.1 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 10.25% Senior Notes (the "Senior Notes"). In addition to the partial redemption, we paid accrued interest on the Senior Notes of $1.7 million and a call premium of $4.9 million. We recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $5.0 million, primarily representing the cash call premium paid. 
         On July 17, 2017, we used the proceeds of the new Term B loans, borrowed $180.0 million under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the IPO, and cash on hand to fully redeem all of the Company's remaining outstanding Senior Notes and to pay certain fees and expenses. In connection with the redemption of the Senior Notes, we satisfied and discharged the indenture governing the Senior Notes. We paid $729.9 million in principal amount, incurred prepayment fees of $18.7 million and paid accrued interest of $37.6 million. We recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $19.8 million related to the write-off of deferred issuance costs, premium, and prepayment fees. 
   Redemption of 13.38% Senior Subordinated Notes 
         During the year ended December 31, 2016, we made two payments to partially redeem our 13.38% Senior Subordinated Notes. The final redemption payment was made on December 18, 2016. 
   Refinancing of the Term B Loans and Revolving Credit Facility 
         On July 17, 2017, the Company entered into an eighth amendment ("Eighth Amendment") to its Credit Agreement, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent and revolver agent. Under the Eighth Amendment, (i) we borrowed new Term B loans in an aggregate principal amount of $230.5 million, for a total outstanding Term B loan principal amount of $2.28 billion and (ii) the revolving credit commitments were increased by an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million, for a total outstanding revolving credit commitment of $300.0 million available to us under the revolving credit facility. The new Term B loans will mature on August 19, 2023 and bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to ABR plus 2.25% or LIBOR plus 3.25%. Loans under the revolving credit facility will mature on May 31, 2022 and bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to ABR plus 2.00% or LIBOR plus 3.00%. The guarantees, collateral and covenants in the Eighth Amendment remain unchanged from those contained in the credit agreement prior to the Eighth Amendment. 
         On May 31, 2017, the Company entered into a seventh amendment ("Seventh Amendment") to its Credit Agreement. The Seventh Amendment (i) refinanced the then existing $200.0 million of borrowings available to the Company under the revolving credit facility and (ii) extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to May 31, 2022, unless an earlier date was triggered under certain circumstances. The interest rate margins applicable to the revolving credit facility bore interest at a rate equal to ABR plus 2.00% or LIBOR plus 3.00%. Additionally, the Company entered into an Incremental Commitment Letter to its revolving credit facility that increased the available borrowings to $300.0 million that became available upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions (see discussion of the redemption of Senior Notes above, whereby such conditionality was subsequently achieved as a result of the Eighth Amendment). The guarantees, collateral and covenants in the Seventh Amendment remained unchanged from those contained in the credit agreement prior to the Seventh Amendment.

     Sale of Chicago Fiber Network 
         On December 14, 2017, the Company sold a portion of its fiber network in the Chicago market to a subsidiary of Verizon for $225.0 million in cash. In addition, the Company and Verizon entered into a new construction agreement pursuant to which the Company will complete the build-out of the network in exchange for approximately $50.0 million (which approximates the Company's remaining estimate to complete the network build-out), payable as the remaining network elements are completed. The final build-out of the network is expected to be completed during the second half of 2018. 
 Sale of Lawrence, Kansas Systems 
         On January 12, 2017, we and Midcontinent Communications ("MidCo") entered into an agreement under which MidCo acquired our Lawrence, Kansas systems, for gross proceeds of approximately $213.0 million in cash, subject to certain normal and customary purchase price adjustments set forth in the agreement. We and MidCo also entered into a Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which the Company provides certain services to MidCo on a transitional basis. Charges for the transition services generally allow us to fully recover all allowed costs and allocated expenses incurred in connection with providing these services, generally without profit. The results of our Lawrence, Kansas system are included for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, and the first 12 days for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
   NuLink Acquisition 
         On September 9, 2016, we finalized our acquisition of HC Cable Opco, LLC d/b/a NuLink in Newnan, Georgia for $54.3 million, all of which we paid in cash. The acquisition extended our HSD, Video and Telephony service and award-winning customer service to more than 34 thousand additional homes and businesses. The results of our NuLink acquisition from September 9, 2016 through December 31, 2017 are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 
   Our Systems and Markets 
         Our systems deliver services in the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the United States. As of December 31, 2017, these networks passed approximately 3,109 thousand homes and businesses and served approximately 777 thousand total customers, reflecting a total customer penetration rate of 25%. Within these markets, we typically have a customer base with income levels above the national average, 
 7

   unemployment rates below the national average, and a propensity to purchase higher-margin bundled services. An overview of our markets as of December 31, 2017 is shown below:

        We believe we have one of the most technically advanced and uniform networks in the industry with approximately 97% of our network at 750 MHz or greater capacity and delivering a full suite of products including HSD, Video (including VOD and HD) and Telephony. Given the advanced and uniform nature of our next generation network, we are able to maintain the network relatively inexpensively, launch new services quickly and efficiently and maintain our own telephony infrastructure. Our advanced plant will allow us to continue to roll out competitive HD channel line ups and higher data speeds without major capital requirements. 
         Our most significant competitors are other cable television operators, direct broadcast satellite providers and certain telephone companies that offer services that provide features and functionality similar to our HSD, Video and Telephony services. We believe that our strategy of operating primarily in secondary markets provides better operating and financial stability compared to the more competitive environments in large metropolitan markets. We have a history of successfully competing in chosen markets despite the presence of competing incumbent providers. 
   Our Operating Philosophy and Commitment to Customer Service 
         We believe that our operating philosophy "to deliver an employee and customer experience that lives up to our name" is central to our success. This philosophy influences how we are organized and informs the process we employ to acquire and retain customers. For example, we use a needs-based selling process to recommend packages that best fit customers' service and pricing needs. We seek to keep our customer response activities closely coordinated with all operational aspects of our business, so that resources are appropriately allocated and operating efficiencies are optimized. We believe in offering customers an experience that is convenient for them by generally providing installation and service appointments within a two hour window, seven days a week.

           We use targeted marketing modeling to drive profitable growth and minimize risk of non-pay churn. This analysis is performed at the node level in our network so that marketing and sales tactics drive penetration in a highly targeted manner. We also believe that the responsibility for winning new customers extends beyond the sales and marketing department to our entire company. 
         We have demonstrated our ability to grow by delivering a strong customer experience, offering high value bundles and packages, and smartly and selectively introducing new competitive offerings. We believe our philosophy of providing value based pricing differentiates WOW in the market. We strive to ensure our customers can enjoy a seamless experience of one installation, one bill, and one service provider. Our strategy has led to bundled customers accounting for approximately 55% of our total customer mix. Bundling has allowed us to maximize the revenue generating capability of our networks through increased penetration, increased revenue per customer, greater pricing flexibility and increased customer retention. 
         Our operating philosophy and commitment to customer service have translated into numerous independent awards and significant recognition for our focus on the customer experience. For example, WOW has:
 

Â• Rated highest by Consumer Reports Magazine across multiple categories 15 times over the last 9 years; 
Â• Received the J.D. Power and Associates recognition for highest customer satisfaction across multiple categories 21 times in the last
13 years; 
Â• Recognized by PC Magazine with the Reader's Choice Award 5 times in the last 7 years. 

 Our Bundled Service Offering 
         We offer a complete solution of HSD, Video and Telephony services in all of our markets. We sell these services through a broad range of service bundles designed to address the varying needs of existing and potential customers. We sell individual services at prices competitive to those of the incumbent providers and attractively price our bundles to create more value for our customers to drive switching. Bundles also provide customers with an integrated billing and customer service experience for multiple products. Bundling our services enables us to increase penetration, raise average revenue per customer, improve operating efficiency, facilitate customer service, reduce customer acquisition and installation costs, and increase customer retention. 
 Residential Data Services 
         We offer tiered HSD services to residential customers that include always-on high-speed connections to the Internet using cable modems. We will offer a connection up to 1 GIG service (1000 Mbps) in 95% of our markets by the end of the first quarter 2018. We offer month to month and term based pricing to provide customers the most flexibility. 
         Our data packages generally include the following:
 

Â• specialized technical support 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
Â• a home portal page with customizable access to local content, weather, news, sports and financial reports; 
Â• value-added features such as e-mail accounts; 
Â• advanced wireless home networking; and 
Â• DOCSIS-compliant modem installed by a trained professional. 

 9

           As a result of evolving customer preferences, we are experiencing an increase in customers who purchase only HSD services. 
   Video Services 
         We offer our customers a full array of video services and programming choices. Customers generally pay initial connection charges and fixed monthly fees for video service. 
         Our video service offering comprises the following:
 

Â• Basic Cable Service:    All of our video customers receive a package of limited basic programming, which generally consists of local
broadcast television and local community programming, including public, educational and government access channels. The expanded basic level of programming includes approximately 75 channels of
satellite-delivered or non-broadcast channels, such as ESPN, MTV, USA, CNN, The Discovery Channel, Nickelodeon and various home shopping networks. 
Â• Digital Cable Service, HD channels, and Premiums:    This digital level of service includes over 275 channels of digital programming,
including our expanded basic cable service, and over 40 music channels. We have introduced new service offerings to strengthen our competitive position and generate additional revenues, including HD
TV, digital video recording ("DVR"), VOD and subscription VOD. VOD permits customers to order movies and other programming on demand with DVD-like functions, and provides thousands of hours of content
available for free, on a pay-per-view basis or with a subscription. Subscription VOD is a similar service that has specific content available to customers who subscribe to the underlying premium
channel. 
Â• Ultra:    We offer our Ultra video product in select markets. Ultra is priced higher than digital cable service and is an all-in-one
solution for our customers. Ultra's advanced feature set includes whole-home DVR, remote DVR management, wireless home networking, ability to access Netflix without switching inputs on TV, caller ID
on TV, the ability to view personal content from a PC on TV, parental control from anywhere and a smart menu user interface. We intend to develop additional features and enhancements such as a
recommendation engine, user customization options and a variety of apps. Since its launch in February 2012, Ultra TV has attracted approximately 128 thousand customers as of December 31,
2017. 
Â• Premium Channels:    These channels, such as HBO, Showtime, Starz, Encore and Cinemax, provide commercial-free movies, sports and
other special event entertainment programming and are available as part of a bundle or at an additional charge above our expanded basic and digital tiers of service. 

         Our platform enables us to provide an attractive service offering of extensive programming as well as interactive services. 
   Telephony Services 
         We provide residential voice services using VoIP. Our telephony services include local and long-distance telephone services. We offer telephone packages that include different combinations of the following core services:


Â• local area calling plans; 
Â• flat-rate local and long-distance plans; 
Â• unlimited local and long-distance plans; 
Â• popular calling features such as caller ID, call waiting and voicemail; and 
Â• measured and fixed rate toll packages based on usage.

     Business Telephony and Data Services 
         Our broadband network also supports services to business customers and we have developed a full suite of products for small, medium and large local enterprises. We offer the traditional bundled product offering and have also developed new products to meet the more complex high-speed data and telephony needs of medium and large local enterprises. We offer fiber based services, which enable our customers to have enhanced telephony services, data speeds of up to 10 gigabit per second on our fiber network, and office-to-office metro Ethernet services that provide a secure and managed connection between customer locations. We have introduced our Hosted Voice product offering, which can replace customers' aging private branch exchange ("PBX") products with telephony and data service that offers more flexible features at a lower cost. In addition, we have a Session Initiated Protocol (SIP) trunking service. This service is a direct replacement for the traditional telephone service used by large PBX customers and is delivered over our fiber network and terminated via an Ethernet connection at the customer's premise. We have a complete line of collocation infrastructure services, cloud computing, managed backup and recovery services. We serve our business customers from locally based business offices with customer service and network support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
 Pricing for Our Products and Services 
         We employ value based pricing strategies for our services to promote sales of bundled packages, as well as the option to purchase Internet Ã  la carte. We offer bundles of two or more services with tiered features and prices to meet the demands of a variety of customers. The bundle approach simplifies our customers' experience, while creating operational efficiencies by reducing the number of plans handled by our sales and call center personnel and by reducing the number of packages supported in our billing system. We also sell individual services at prices competitive to Ã  la carte services sold by our competitors. An installation fee may be charged to new and reconnected customers. We charge monthly fees for customer premise equipment. 
 Our Interactive Broadband Network 
         Our network is critical to the implementation of our operating strategy, allowing us to offer bundled HSD, Video, Telephony, Metro Ethernet, and other enterprise class services to our customers in an efficient manner and with a high level of quality. In addition to providing high capacity and scalability, our network has been specifically engineered to have increased reliability, including features such as:


Â• redundant fiber routing which enables the rapid, automatic redirection of network traffic in the event of a fiber cut; 
Â• back-up power supplies in our network which ensure continuity of our service in the event of a power outage; and 
Â• network monitoring to the customer premise for all digital HSD, Video and Telephony services. 

 Technical Overview 
         Our interactive broadband network consists primarily of an advanced hybrid fiber coaxial cable network. Fiber-optic cable is a communications medium that uses glass fibers to transmit signals over long distances with minimum signal loss or distortion. In most of our network, our system's owned high capacity fiber-optic cables connect to our technical facilities and multiple nodes throughout our network. These nodes are connected to individual homes and buildings by fiber and coaxial cable and are shared by a number of customers. We have sufficient fiber and cable capacity to subdivide our nodes if growth so dictates. Our HFC network has excellent broadband frequency characteristics and physical durability, which is conducive to providing HSD, Video and Telephony transmission. 
 11

           As of December 31, 2017, our network consisted of over 34 thousand miles of network, passed over 3,109 thousand homes and businesses and served approximately 777 thousand total customers. Our interactive broadband network is designed using redundant fiber-optic cables. Our fiber rings are "self-healing," which means that they provide for very rapid, automatic redirection of network traffic so that our service will continue even if there is a single point of failure on a fiber ring. 
         We distribute our bundled services from our technical facilities called headends, hub sites, and data centers each of which is equipped with a generator and battery back-up power source to allow service to continue during a power outage. Additionally, individual nodes that are served by the facilities are equipped with back-up generators or batteries. Our redundant fiber-optic cables and network powering systems allow us to provide circuit-based telephony services consistent with industry reliability standards for traditional telephone systems. 
         We monitor our network 24 hours a day, seven days a week from our network operations centers in Naperville, Illinois. Technicians in each of our service areas schedule and perform installations and repairs and monitor the performance of our interactive broadband network. We actively maintain the quality of our network to minimize service interruptions and extend the network's operational life. 
   High-Speed Data Services 
         We provide Internet access using high-speed cable modems in the same way customers receive Internet services over modems linked to the local telephone network. We provide our customers with a high level of data transfer rates through multiple peering arrangements with tier-one Internet facility providers. 
 Video Services 
         Our network is designed for digital two-way interactive transmission with fiber-optic cable carrying signals from the headend to hubs and to distribution points (nodes) within our customers' neighborhoods, where the signals are transferred to our coaxial cable network for delivery to our customers. 
 Telephony Services 
         We offer telephony service over our broadband network. We install a network interface box outside a customer's home or an Embedded Multimedia Terminal Adapter in the home to provide dial tone service. Our network interconnects with those of other local phone companies. In addition, we serve our telephony customers using Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP") switching technology. This newer architecture allows for the same enhanced custom calling services as traditional time division multiplexing switching systems, as well as additional advanced business services such as session initiation protocol, hosted PBX services and other services. 
 Business Services 
         In addition to the Data, Video and Telephony outlined above, we also utilize our network to provide other business services, including session initiated protocol, web hosting, metro Ethernet and wireless backhaul services. We also provide advanced collocation and cloud infrastructure services including private cage or cabinet with high availability power, virtual and physical compute, high performance storage, dedicated firewall/load balancers, private virtual local area network segmentation, disaster recovery to the cloud and backup and archive as a service. 
 Programming 
         We purchase some of our programming directly from the program networks by entering into affiliation agreements with the programming suppliers. We also benefit from our membership with the National Cable Television Cooperative ("NCTC"), which enables us to take advantage of volume discounts. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 66% of our programming was sourced from the NCTC, which also handles our contracting and billing arrangements for this programming.

  Competition 
         Our competition comes from a variety of communications companies because of the broad number of HSD, Video and Telephony services we offer to both residential and business customers. We have at least one major cable (typically Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") or Charter Communications Inc. ("Charter") competitor in most of our markets and our largest telecommunications competitor is AT&T, Inc. ("AT&T"). Competition is based on service, content, reliability, bundling, value and convenience. We believe our consistent recognition for having a strong commitment to customer service provides meaningful differentiation versus our competitors. In addition, we face increasing competition from content owners that utilize internet-based delivery of content directly to consumers, some without charging a fee to access the content. 
 High Speed Data Services 
         We primarily compete against other cable television companies, incumbent local exchange carriers ("ILECs") that provide dial-up and DSL services and other wireless Internet access services to provide consumers with data services. Competitors' HSD offerings also include a range of services from DSL to gigabit Ethernet. Our competitors primarily provide services over traditional telephone networks or broadband data networks. By contrast, our services are offered over pure and hybrid fiber network connections. Our additional services include spam filtering, email, private web space, online storage and customizable news and entertainment content. Importantly, we compete against other data service providers by offering high-quality HSD services and a differentiated customer service experience. 
 Video Services 
         Cable television systems are operated under non-exclusive franchises granted by local authorities, which may result in more than one cable operator providing video services in a particular market. Our cable competitors currently include Charter, Comcast and Mediacom Communications Corporation ("Mediacom"). We also encounter competition from direct broadcast satellite systems, including DirecTV and Dish Network that transmit signals to small dish antennas owned by the end-user. 
         The Telecommunications Act of 1996 ("1996 Act") eliminated many restrictions on local telephone companies offering video programming. We face competition from companies subject to the 1996 Act, including AT&T, Frontier Communications Corporation ("Frontier"), CenturyLink, Inc. ("CenturyLink") and Verizon Communications, Inc. ("Verizon"). These companies currently provide video services to homes in portions of our markets. Given the publicly stated intentions of AT&T and Verizon, we expect modest additional ILEC "fiber to the home" activity in our footprints. We also compete with systems that provide multichannel program services directly to hotel, motel, apartment, condominium and other multi-unit complexes through a satellite master antennaÂ—a single satellite dish for an entire building or complex. 
         Cable television distributors may, in some markets, compete for customers with other video programming distributors and other providers of entertainment, news and information. Alternative methods of distributing video programming offered by cable television systems include "over the top", or "OTT", business models such as Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Amazon and Apple. Increasingly, content owners are using Internet-based delivery of content directly to consumers, some without charging a fee to access the content. Further, due to consumer electronic innovations, consumers are able to watch such Internet-delivered content on televisions, personal computers, tablets, gaming boxes connected to televisions and mobile devices. HBO and CBS sell their programming directly to consumers over the Internet. Dish Network offers Sling TV, which includes ESPN among other programming, and Sony offers PlayStation Vue. We believe some customers have chosen or will choose to receive video over the Internet rather than through our VOD and subscription video services, thereby reducing our video subscriber base, in a trend known as "cord-cutting". While difficult to quantify and extrapolate, we 
 13

   expect this trend to continue in the future. Notwithstanding those trends, we believe that we are positioned to benefit as these customers will require robust Internet connection in order to efficiently access such OTT content, which could lead to increased demand for our HSD services as a result of any "cord-cutting". 
         In addition to other means, we compete with these companies by delivering a differentiated customer service experience and programming content, including the number of channels and the availability of local programming. 
         Importantly, we also compete against video service providers with a bundled high-speed data, video and telephony product which not all of our competitors can deliver. 
   Telephony Services 
         In providing local and long-distance telephony services, we compete with the incumbent local phone company, various long-distance providers and VoIP telephone providers in each of our markets. AT&T, CenturyLink, Frontier and Verizon are the incumbent local phone companies in our current markets. We also compete with a number of long-distance telephone service providers, such as AT&T, CenturyLink, Frontier and Verizon. In addition, we compete with a variety of smaller, regional competitors that may lease network components from AT&T, CenturyLink, Frontier or Verizon and focus on the commercial segment of our markets. 
         Following years of development, VoIP has been deployed by a variety of service providers including the other Multiple System Operators ("MSOs") that we compete against and independent service providers such as Vonage Holding Corporation. Unlike circuit switched technology, this technology does not require ownership of the last mile and eliminates the need to rent the last mile from the Regional Bell Operating Companies. VoIP providers have had differing levels of success based on their brand recognition, financial support, technical abilities, and legal and regulatory decisions. 
         Wireless telephone service is viewed by some consumers as a replacement for traditional telephone service. Wireless service is priced on a flat-rate or usage-sensitive basis and rates are continuously decreasing. 
   Bundled Services 
         Most of our cable competitors have deployed their own versions of the triple-play bundle in our markets. Charter, Comcast, Mediacom and other MSOs offer VoIP, thereby enabling their own versions of a triple play bundle in our markets. 
         AT&T U-verse, Frontier and Verizon FiOS offer bundled services by providing video via their broadband networks in certain markets. AT&T U-verse has deployed video in many of our markets. Additionally, AT&T, through its ownership of DirecTV, also provides a satellite video offering. Through its acquisition of Verizon FiOS assets, Frontier offers bundled services in Pinellas County. Consequently, we overlap with Verizon FiOS only in our Baltimore market. 
         We believe that advanced network, competitive HSD products and emphasis on customer service will continue to be a strategic initiative and that the best way to retain and attract customers is through an additional focus on technology and development of broadband data applications. 
   Employees 
         As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 3,000 full-time employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and we structure our compensation and benefit plans in order to attract and retain high-performing employees. We will need to recruit additional employees in order to implement our growth plan. We recruit from several major industries for employees with skills 
 14

   in high-speed data, video and telephony technologies. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. 
   Legislation and Regulation 
         We operate in highly regulated industries and both our cable television and telecommunications services are subject to broad regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Our Internet services have historically been subject to more limited regulation, although the FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order expanded regulation of Internet services as more fully described below. The following is a summary of laws and regulations affecting the cable television and telecommunications industries. It does not purport to be a complete summary of all present and proposed legislation and regulations pertaining to our operations. 
 Regulation of Cable Services 
         The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), the principal federal regulatory agency with jurisdiction over cable television operators and services, has promulgated regulations covering many aspects of cable television operations. The composition of the FCC changed in January 2017. We anticipate that the newly composed FCC will modify some regulations applicable to our business; however, the impact on our business is unknown. The FCC enforces its regulations through the imposition of monetary fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders and/or the imposition of other administrative sanctions. Cable franchises, the principal instrument of governmental authority for our cable television operations, are not issued by the FCC but by states, cities, counties or political subdivisions. A brief summary of certain key federal regulations follows. 



Rate Regulation 

         The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 ("1992 Cable Act") authorized rate regulation for certain cable services and equipment in certain markets. It also eliminated direct oversight of rates by the FCC and local franchising authorities of all but the basic service tier of cable service. Rate regulation of the basic tier does not apply, however, when a cable operator is subject to effective competition in the relevant community. Under an order issued by the FCC in 2015, cable operators are presumed to be subject to effective competition. That Order was appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court, which denied the petition for review. Moreover, some local franchising authorities that could otherwise regulate basic rates for cable systems that are not subject to effective competition choose not to do so. We are not currently subject to cable service rate regulation in any of our markets. 
 


Program Access 

         To promote competition between incumbent cable operators and independent cable programmers, the 1992 Cable Act placed restrictions on dealings between certain cable programmers and cable operators. Satellite video programmers affiliated with cable operators are prohibited in most cases from favoring those cable operators over competing distributors of multi-channel video programming, such as satellite television operators and unaffiliated competitive cable operators such as us. Specifically, the program access regulations generally prohibit exclusive contracts for satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming between any cable operator and any cable-affiliated programming vendor. On October 5, 2012, the FCC adopted and released a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Matter of Revision of the Commission's Program Access Rules ("Program Access FNPRM"). The FCC declined to extend the exclusive contract prohibition section of the program access rules beyond its October 5, 2012 sunset date. The prohibition applies only to programming that is delivered via satellite; it does not apply to programming delivered via terrestrial facilities. The FCC determined that a preemptive prohibition on exclusive contracts is no longer "necessary to preserve and protect 
 15

   competition and diversity in the distribution of video programming" considering that a case-by-case process will remain in place after the prohibition expires to assess the impact of individual exclusive contracts. In the Program Access FNPRM, the FCC also requested comment on revisions to the program access rules pertaining to buying groups and rebuttable presumptions in program access complaint proceedings challenging certain exclusive contracts. The Program Access FNPRM is still pending. 
 


Commercial Leased Access 

         The Communications Act requires that cable systems with 36 or more channels make available a portion of their channel capacity for commercial leased access by third parties to facilitate competitive programming efforts. We have not been subject to many requests for carriage under the leased access rules. 
 


Carriage of Broadcast Television Signals 

         The 1992 Cable Act established broadcast signal carriage (so-called "must carry") requirements that allow local commercial television broadcast stations to elect every three years whether to require the cable systems in the relevant area to carry the station's signal or whether to require the cable system to negotiate for consent to carry the station. The most recent election by broadcasters became effective on January 1, 2018. For local, non- commercial stations cable systems are also subject to must-carry obligations. We now carry most commercial stations pursuant to retransmission consent agreements and pay fees for such consents. 
 


Franchise Authority 

         Cable television systems operate pursuant to non-exclusive franchises issued by franchising authorities, which, depending on the specific jurisdiction can be the states, cities, counties or political subdivisions in which a cable operator provides cable service. Franchising authority is premised upon the cable operator crossing and using public rights-of-way to construct and maintain its system. The terms of franchises, while variable, typically include requirements concerning services, franchise fees, construction timelines, mandated service areas, customer service standards, technical requirements, public, educational and government access channels and support, and channel capacity. Franchise authorities may terminate a franchise or assess penalties if the franchised cable operator fails to adhere to the conditions of the franchise. Although largely discretionary, the exercise of state and local franchise authority is limited by federal statutes and regulations adopted pursuant thereto. We believe that the requirements imposed by our franchise agreements are fairly typical for the industry. Although they do vary, our franchises generally provide for the payment of fees to the applicable franchise authority of up to 5% of our gross cable service revenues, which is the current maximum authorized by federal law. Many of our franchises also require that we pay a percentage of our gross revenue in support of public, educational and governmental ("PEG") channels. These so-called PEG fees vary, but generally do not exceed 2% of our gross cable services revenues. 
         On December 20, 2006, the FCC established rules and provided guidance ("2006 Order") pursuant to the Communications Act that prohibit local franchising authorities from unreasonably refusing to award competitive franchises for the provision of cable services. In order to eliminate certain barriers to entry into the cable market, and to encourage investment in broadband facilities, the FCC preempted local laws, regulations, and requirements, including local level-playing-field provisions, to the extent they impose greater restrictions on market entry than those adopted under the order. This order has the potential to benefit us by facilitating our ability to obtain and renew cable service franchises. On January 21, 2015, the FCC issued an Order on Reconsideration of the Second Report and Order. The FCC clarified that the franchising rules and findings it extended to incumbent cable operators in 
 16

   the 2006 Order do not apply to state laws governing cable television operators, or to any state-level cable franchising process. 
         Many state legislatures have enacted legislation streamlining the franchising process, including having the state, instead of local governments, issue franchises. Of particular relevance to us, states with laws streamlining the franchising process or authorizing state-wide or uniform franchises currently include Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee. In some cases, these laws enable us to expand our operations more rapidly by providing for a streamlined franchising process. At the same time, they enable easier entry by additional providers into our service territories. 
 


Franchise Renewal 

         Franchise renewal, or approval for the sale, transfer or assignment of a franchise, may involve the imposition of additional requirements not present in the initial franchise agreement. Franchise renewal is not guaranteed, but federal law imposes certain standards to prohibit the arbitrary denial of franchise renewal. Our franchises are typically issued for 10 to 15 year initial terms, but the terms vary depending upon whether we are operating under a local or state franchise, and many of our existing franchise terms will expire over the course of the next several years. Still, we expect our franchises to be renewed by the relevant franchising authority. The 2006 Order discussed under  Franchise Authority above, as well as some state laws that regulate the issuance of state video franchises, reduce the potential for unreasonable conditions being imposed upon renewal. 
 


Pole Attachments 

         The Communications Act requires all local telephone companies and electric utilities, except those owned by municipalities and co-operatives, to provide cable operators and telecommunications carriers with nondiscriminatory access to poles, ducts, conduit and rights-of-way at just and reasonable rates, except where states have certified to the FCC that they regulate pole access and pole attachment rates. The right to access poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way pursuant to regulated rates and set timeframes is highly beneficial to facilities-based providers such as us. Federal law also establishes principles to govern the pricing and terms of such access. Currently, 20 states and the District of Columbia have made certifications to the FCC, which leaves pole attachment matters to be regulated by those states. Of the states in which we operate, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio have made certifications to the FCC. The FCC has clarified that the provision of Internet services by a cable operator does not affect the agency's jurisdiction over pole attachments by that cable operator, nor does the provision of such non-cable services affect the rate formula otherwise applicable to the cable operator. 
         In April 2011, the FCC adopted an order that examined a number of issues involving access to pole attachments by telecommunications carriers, including the rights of ILECs to demand nondiscriminatory access in certain situations, and which attempted to bring the rates that cable operators and telecommunications carriers charge closer to parity. In November 2015, the FCC released another order taking further steps to balance the rates paid by cable operators and telecommunications carriers. Part of the order addresses some industry members' concerns that pole attachment rates might increase sharply now that the FCC has reclassified broadband service as telecommunications service as discussed further below. The 2015 order was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, which rejected the petition. It is uncertain, however, how the Open Internet Order and the Internet Freedom Order discussed below might impact attachment rights and costs. 
 17

   


Internet Service 

         To date, the FCC has rejected requests by some Internet service providers to require cable operators to provide unaffiliated Internet service providers with direct access to the operators' broadband facilities. On December 23, 2010, the FCC adopted "net neutrality" rules requiring fixed and mobile providers of broadband Internet access to comply with certain disclosure and other rules designed to maximize consumer access to broadband services ("2010 Open Internet Order"). In summary, the rules impose obligations related to ensuring provider transparency and preventing unreasonable blocking and discrimination of content, applications or services. In general, the requirements, which took effect on November 20, 2011, permit reasonable network management practices by broadband providers. Challenges to the "net neutrality" rules, including the FCC's jurisdiction to adopt the rules, were filed in federal appellate court. On January 14, 2014, a D.C. Circuit panel struck down the portions of the FCC's 2010 Open Internet Order rules that had banned blocking or discriminatory treatment of websites or other online applications by retail broadband Internet access providers such as incumbent telephone companies and cable operators ("D.C. Circuit Order"). At the same time, the court approved the agency's requirement that broadband providers adequately disclose their policies regarding blocking and "network management" (that is, practices for avoiding network congestion, giving priority to some classes of traffic over others, etc.). 
         On February 26, 2015, the FCC announced that it reclassified broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act ("Open Internet Order"). The FCC announced that its Open Internet Order prohibits: (i) broadband providers from blocking access to legal content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices; (ii) broadband providers from impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices; and (iii) broadband providers from favoring some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kindÂ—in other words, no "fast lanes." This rule also bans ISPs such as us from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates. The FCC further announced that its Open Internet Order will require additional disclosure and network management practices, and will extend a number of the Title II regulatory requirements to broadband Internet access services, such as compliance with the privacy provisions of Section 222 of the Communications Act. 
         The legality of the Open Internet Order was challenged in court by a number of parties. On June 14, 2016, the D.C. Circuit upheld the Open Internet Order. 
         The composition of the FCC changed in January 2017. On December 14, 2017, the Commission adopted the Restoring Internet Freedom Declaratory Ruling, Report and Order (the "Internet Freedom Order"), which, when effective, would repeal the Open Internet Order and reclassify broadband Internet access as an information service, not subject to Title II of the Communications Act. The Internet Freedom Order is not yet effective and may be subject to further legislative change and court challenges. 
         It is unknown at this time if the Internet Freedom Order will be implemented, modified or repealed, and so we do not know if and how the new rules as finally adopted and implemented may affect our business. 
 


Tier Buy-through 

         The tier buy-through prohibition contained in the 1992 Cable Act generally prohibits cable operators from requiring subscribers to purchase a particular service tier, other than the basic service tier, in order to obtain access to video programming offered on a per-channel or per-program basis. In general, a cable television operator has the right to select the channels and services that are available on its cable system. With the exception of certain channels that are required to be carried by federal law as part of the basic tier, such as certain local broadcast television channels, the cable operator has broad discretion in choosing the channels that will be available and how those channels will be 
 18

   packaged and marketed to subscribers. In order to maximize the number of subscribers, the cable operator selects channels that are likely to appeal to a broad spectrum of viewers. If Congress or the FCC were to place more stringent requirements on how we package our services, such requirements could have an adverse effect on our profitability. 
 


Potential Regulatory Changes 

         The regulation of cable television systems at the federal, state and local levels has substantially changed over the past two decades since enactment of the 1992 Cable Act. Material additional changes in the law and implementing regulatory requirements, both those described above and others cannot be ascertained with any certainty at this time. Our business could be adversely affected by future changes in regulations. 
 


Regulation of Telecommunication Services 

         Our telecommunications services are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local regulation. Pursuant to the Communications Act, as amended by the 1996 Act, the FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over the facilities of, and the services offered by, telecommunications carriers that provide interstate or international communications services. The FCC has extended many of its regulations that apply to traditional telecommunications service to Internet based, or interconnected VoIP phone services. Barring federal preemption, state regulatory authorities retain jurisdiction over the same facilities to the extent that they are used to provide intrastate communications services, as well as facilities solely used to provide intrastate services. Local regulation is largely limited to the management of the occupation and use of county or municipal public rights-of-way. Various international authorities may also seek to regulate the provision of certain services. As addressed in more detail above, in the Internet Freedom Order, the FCC reversed the Open Internet Order and re-characterized broadband Internet access services as information services no longer subject to various Title II requirements. 
 


Regulation of Local Exchange Operations 

         Our ILEC subsidiaries are regulated by both federal and state agencies. Our interstate products and services and the regulated telecommunications earnings of all of our subsidiaries are subject to federal regulation by the FCC, and our local and intrastate products and services and the regulated earnings are subject to regulation by state public service commissions ("PSC"). The FCC has principal jurisdiction over matters including, but not limited to, interstate switched and special access rates. The FCC also regulates the rates that ILECs and CLECs may charge for the use of their local networks in originating or terminating interstate and international transmissions. PSCs have jurisdiction over matters including local service rates, intrastate access rates and the quality of service. 
         The Communications Act places certain obligations, including those described below, on ILECs to open their networks to competitive providers, as well as heightened interconnection obligations and a duty to make their services available to resellers at a wholesale discount rate. The following are certain obligations that the Communications Act and the 1996 Act, as implemented by the FCC, place on ILECs, which gives us important rights in the areas where we operate as competitors, and actual or potential obligations where our ILEC subsidiaries operate:
 

Â• Interconnection. Establishes requirements and standards applicable to ILECs that receive requests from other carriers for network
interconnection, unbundling of network elements, collocation of equipment and resale, and requires all local exchange carriers ("LECs") to enter into mutual compensation arrangements with other for
transport and termination of local calls on each other's networks. 

 19

   

Â• Reciprocal Compensation. Requires all ILECs and CLECs to complete calls originated by competing local exchange carriers under reciprocal
arrangements at prices set by the FCC, PSCs or at negotiated prices. 
Â• Collocation of Equipment. Allows CLECs to install and maintain their own network equipment in ILEC central offices. 
Â• Number Portability. Requires all providers of telecommunications services, as well as providers of interconnected VoIP services, to permit
users of telecommunications services to retain their existing telephone numbers without impairment of quality, reliability or convenience when switching from one telecommunications provider to
another. While number portability generally benefits our CLEC operations, it represents a burden to our ILEC subsidiaries. 
Â• Access to Rights-of-Way. Requires telecommunications carriers to permit other carriers access to poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way at
regulated prices and set time frames. 

         We have entered into PSC approved local interconnection agreements with a variety of telecom providers for, among other things, the transport and termination of our local telephone traffic. Some of these agreements have expired and we continue to operate on the same rates, terms, and conditions in the interim as we seek to enter into successor agreements. These agreements are subject to changes as a result of changes in laws and regulations, and there is no guarantee that the rates and terms concerning our interconnection agreements with ILECs under which we operate today will be available in the future. 
 


Inter-Carrier Compensation 

         Our LEC subsidiaries currently receive compensation from other telecommunications providers, including long distance companies, for origination and termination of interexchange traffic through network access charges that are established in accordance with state and federal laws. Accordingly, we benefit from the receipt and termination of intrastate and interstate long distance traffic, though we also make payments to other telecommunications carriers when they terminate our telecommunications traffic. 
         Several of our subsidiaries are classified by the FCC as non-dominant carriers with respect to both interstate and international long-distance services and competitive local exchange services. As non-dominant carriers, these subsidiaries' rates presently are not generally regulated by the FCC, although the rates are still subject to general statutory requirements applicable to all carriers that the rates be just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory. We may file tariffs for interstate access charges for these carriers on a permissive basis, but otherwise our interstate services are mandatorily detariffed and subject to our ability to enter into relationships with our customers through contracts. Our interstate access services are tariffed and fall within FCC-established benchmarks for such services. 
         Certain of our subsidiaries are regulated by the FCC as dominant carriers in the provision of interstate switched access services. These subsidiaries must file tariffs with the FCC and must provide the FCC with notice prior to changing their rates, terms or conditions of interstate access services. Each such subsidiary has filed its own tariff or concurred in the tariffs filed by the National Exchange Carrier Association. 
 


Regulatory Treatment of VoIP Services 

         A significant part of our telephony line of business is classified by the FCC as VoIP. At this time, the FCC and state regulators have not classified most IP-enabled services as regulated telecommunications services. The FCC, for example, has applied to providers of "interconnected VoIP" services some of its rules applicable to traditional circuit switched telephone providers, but has yet to issue a ruling determining whether interconnected VoIP providers are to be regulated as providers of 
 20

   information services or telecommunications services. The FCC initiated a rulemaking proceeding in 2004 to examine issues relating to the appropriate regulatory classification of IP-enabled services, including VoIP services. We cannot predict when or if the FCC will issue a final decision in this proceeding, though it has issued several decisions in the interim applying certain regulatory requirements to providers of interconnected VoIP services. These requirements include, among others, regulations relating to federal universal service contributions, the confidentiality of customer data and communications, cooperation with law enforcement, discontinuation of service, numbering and number portability, outage reporting, 911 emergency access and disability access. The FCC has also established certain other requirements that impact our VoIP services. For example, the FCC requires that we provide certain notices to our VoIP customers concerning the limitations of the services, particularly in connection with the ability of the service (including access to E911) to function in the event of a power outage. We are also required to offer our customers a back-up power solution to enable the services to continue to function in the event of a power outage. Within our VoIP line of business, we currently comply with all applicable regulations that have been issued by the FCC or state regulatory agencies. Decisions and regulations from similar proceedings in the future could lead to an increase in the costs associated with providing VoIP services. At this time, we are unable to predict the impact, if any, that additional regulatory action on these issues will have on our business. 
 


Universal Service 

         The Federal Universal Service Fund ("USF") is the support mechanism established by the FCC to ensure that high quality, affordable telecommunications service is available to all Americans. Pursuant to the FCC's universal service rules, all telecommunications providers and interconnected VoIP providers, including us, must contribute a percentage of their interstate and international end-user telecommunications and interconnected VoIP revenues to the USF. The FCC establishes an industry-wide quarterly contribution factor, which sets the exact percentage that applies for the given quarter. The contribution factor for the first quarter of 2018 is 19.5% of gross assessable interstate and international telecommunications and interconnected VoIP revenues. The contribution rate is reviewed quarterly and may increase or decrease, which would either increase or decrease our contributions to the USF. This is not materially adverse to our business as we currently choose to recover the cost of the contributions from our end user customers. However, climbing USF contributions may negatively impact our end users because they effectively make our products more expensive. 
 


Forbearance and Other Relief to Dominant Carriers 

         The Communications Act permits the FCC to forbear from requiring telecommunications carriers to comply with certain of its regulations and provisions of the Communications Act if certain conditions are present that make enforcement of the regulations or statutory provisions unnecessary. Future reduction or elimination of federal regulatory and statutory requirements could free us from regulatory burdens, but might also increase the relative flexibility of our major competitors. As a result of grants of forbearance, our costs (and those of our competitors) of purchasing broadband services from carriers could increase significantly, as the rates, terms and conditions offered in non-tariffed "commercial agreements" may become less favorable and we may not be able to purchase services from alternative vendors. 
 


Multiple Tenant Properties 

         The FCC has prohibited telecommunications carriers from entering into exclusive access agreements (or enforcing pre-existing exclusive arrangements) with building owners or managers in both commercial and residential multi-tenant environments. The FCC has also adopted rules requiring utilities (including ILEC's) to provide telecommunications carriers (and cable operators) with reasonable and non-discriminatory access to utility-owned or -controlled conduits and rights-of-way in 
 21

   all multiple tenant environments (e.g., apartment buildings, office buildings and campuses) in those states where the state government has not certified to the FCC that it regulates utility pole attachments and rights-of-way matters. These requirements may facilitate our access (as well as the access of competitors) to customers in multi-tenant environments, at least with regard to our provision of telecommunications services. 
         In an order released November 13, 2007, the FCC found that contractual agreements between multiple dwelling unit ("MDU") owners and cable operators that grant exclusive access to the cable operator are proscribed as "unfair methods of competition." Under the rule, the Commission prohibits the enforcement of existing exclusivity clauses and the execution of new ones by cable operators and others subject to the relevant statutory provisions. MDUs include a multiple dwelling unit building and any other centrally managed residential real estate development (such as a gated community, mobile home park, or garden apartment complex). These requirements facilitate our access (as well as the access of competitors) to customers in MDU environments, at least with regard to our provision of cable services. They also, however, invalidate any of our existing exclusive access agreements covered by the rules. 
 


Customer Proprietary Network Information, Personally Identifiable Information and Customer Proprietary
Information 

         We are subject to specific customer privacy obligations with respect to our telecommunications and video services. FCC rules protect the privacy of certain information about customers that telecommunications providers, including us, acquire in the course of providing voice telecommunications services. Such protected information, known as Customer Proprietary Network Information ("CPNI"), includes information related to the quantity, technological configuration, type, destination and the amount of use of a telecommunications offering. Certain states have also adopted state-specific CPNI rules. The FCC's rules require affected providers to implement policies to notify customers of their rights, take reasonable precautions to protect CPNI and notify law enforcement agencies if a breach of CPNI occurs. If a federal or state regulatory body determines that we have breached the applicable regulations or implemented the FCC's requirements incorrectly, we could be subject to fines or penalties. 
         Section 631 of the Communications Act requires that we protect the privacy of our video customers. In general, that section: (i) requires that cable operators, such as us, notify customers of our obligations and their privacy rights; and (ii) prohibits cable operators from: (a) disclosing cable customer personally identifiable information (PII) without customer consent, or a court order, except in limited situations; and (b) using the cable system to collect PII without customer consent, unless necessary to provide service or prevent theft of service. Section 631 specifically provides our customers with the right to bring legal action against us if we fail to comply with the statutory requirements. 
         In addition, statutory protections in Section 22 of the Communications Act, including the duty to protect Customer Proprietary Information (interpreted to include CPNI and PII), apply to telecommunications, including broadband Internet access services. 
         Privacy continues to be a major focus of Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, the FCC, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the states. Additional laws, regulations or advisory guidelines could affect our ability to use and share customer information under various additional circumstances. 
 


Taxes and Regulatory Fees 

         We are subject to numerous local, state and federal taxes and regulatory fees, including, but not limited to, local sales taxes, franchise fees and PEG fees, FCC regulatory fees and PSC regulatory fees. We have procedures in place to ensure that we properly collect taxes and fees from our customers and remit such taxes and fees to the appropriate entity pursuant to applicable law and/or regulation. If our 
 22

   collection procedures prove to be insufficient or if a taxing, franchise or regulatory authority determines that our remittances were inadequate, we could be required to make additional payments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 


Environmental Regulation 

         We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental, safety and health laws, and regulations, including those governing such matters as the generation, storage, reporting, treatment, handling, remediation, use, disposal and transportation of and exposure to hazardous materials, the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the atmosphere, the emission of electromagnetic radiation, the protection of wetlands, historic sites and threatened and endangered species, and health and safety. We also may be subject to laws requiring the investigation and cleanup of contamination at sites we own or operate or at third-party waste disposal sites. Such laws often impose joint and strict liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the contamination. We operate several sites in connection with our operations. Our switch sites and some customer premise locations are equipped with backup power sources in the event of an electrical failure. Each of our switch site locations has battery and diesel fuel powered backup generators, and we use batteries to back up some of our customer premise equipment. In addition, some of our sites may have potential contamination risks from historical and surrounding activities. We are not aware of any liability or alleged liability at any owned or operated sites or third-party waste disposal sites that would be expected to have a material adverse effect on us. 
   Franchises 
         As described above, cable television systems generally are constructed and operated under the authority of nonexclusive franchises, granted by local and/or state governmental authorities. Cable system franchises typically contain many conditions, such as time limitations on commencement and completion of system construction, customer service standards including number of channels, the provision of free service to schools and certain other public institutions, the maintenance of insurance and indemnity bonds, the payment of franchise fees and the support of PEG channels. We are currently in the process of renegotiating a small number of expired franchises. We anticipate that those franchises will be renewed. Local regulation of cable television operations and franchising matters is currently subject to federal regulation under the Communications Act and the corresponding regulations of the FCC. The FCC has taken recent steps toward streamlining the franchising process. See Legislation and RegulationÂ—Regulation of Cable Services above. 
         Prior to the scheduled expiration of franchises, we may initiate renewal proceedings with the relevant franchising authorities. The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which the franchising authorities may not unreasonably deny renewals. If a renewal is withheld and the franchising authority takes over operation of the affected cable system or awards the franchise to another party, the franchising authority must pay the cable operator the "fair market value" of the system. The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 also established comprehensive renewal procedures requiring that the renewal application be evaluated on its own merit and not as part of a comparative process with other proposals.
