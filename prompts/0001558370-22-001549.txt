​
Our product lines include starches and sweeteners, animal feed products and edible corn oil. Our starch-based products include both food-grade and industrial starches, as well as biomaterials. Our sweetener products include glucose syrups, high maltose syrups, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, dextrose, polyols, maltodextrins, and glucose and syrup solids. Our products are derived primarily from the processing of corn and other starch-based materials, such as tapioca, potato and rice.
​
Geographic Scope and Operations
​
We utilize our global network of manufacturing facilities to support key global product lines and we have focused our recent investments on expanding plant-based protein product lines, including pulse-based concentrates, flours and isolates. Our manufacturing process is based on a capital-intensive, two-step process that involves the wet-milling and processing of starch-based materials, primarily corn. During the front-end process, the starch-based materials are steeped in a water-based solution and separated into starch and co-products such as protein, fiber and germ used to produce corn oil. The starch is then either dried for sale or further processed to make starches, sweeteners and other ingredients that serve the particular needs of various industries.
​
Our North America region includes 22 manufacturing facilities producing a wide range of starches, sweeteners, gum acacia, peas, and fruit and vegetable concentrates. On November 3, 2020, we increased our 20 percent ownership to acquire 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Verdient Foods, Inc (“Verdient”), which is a Canada-based producer of pulse-based protein concentrates and flours from peas, lentils and fava beans for human food applications.
​
Our South America region includes seven manufacturing facilities that produce regular, modified, waxy tapioca starches, high fructose and high maltose syrups and syrup solids, dextrins and maltodextrins, dextrose, specialty starches, caramel color and sorbitol. On February 12, 2021, we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of Grupo Arcor, an Argentine food company, to establish Ingrear Holding S.A. (the “Arcor joint venture”), a joint venture to combine and operate five manufacturing facilities in Argentina to sell value-added ingredients to customers in the food, beverage, 

3



pharmaceutical and other industries in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay. On August 2, 2021, we and Grupo Arcor completed all closing conditions to finalize the transaction and formally establish the Arcor joint venture, which is managed by a jointly appointed team of executives.
​
Our Asia-Pacific region manufactures corn-based products in South Korea, China and Thailand. We also manufacture tapioca-based and rice-based products in Thailand and plant-based stevia sweetener products in Malaysia and China. We supply tapioca, rice and plant-based stevia sweetener products not only to our Asia-Pacific region, but also to the rest of our global network. The region’s operations include ten manufacturing facilities that produce modified, specialty, regular, waxy, tapioca and rice starches, dextrins, glucose, high maltose syrup, plant-based stevia sweeteners, dextrose, high fructose corn syrup and caramel color.
​
We are continuing to make strategic investments in Asia. On July 1, 2020, we acquired 75 percent ownership of PureCircle Limited (“PureCircle”), which is one of the leading producers and innovators of plant-based stevia sweeteners and flavors for the food and beverage industry. The acquisition brought global innovation and manufacturing expertise, which we are leveraging with our global go-to-market model, formulation capabilities and broad ingredient portfolio. On June 1, 2021, we made additional investments in stevia by entering an agreement with Amyris, Inc. (“Amyris”) for certain exclusive commercialization rights to Amyris’ rebaudioside M by fermentation product, the exclusive licensing of the product’s manufacturing technology and a 31 percent ownership stake in a joint venture for the product (the “Amyris joint venture”).
​
Our EMEA region includes six manufacturing facilities that produce modified and specialty starches, glucose and dextrose in Pakistan, Germany and the United Kingdom. On April 1, 2021, we acquired KaTech, a German-based provider of advanced texture and stabilization solutions to the food and beverage industry.
​
Additionally, we utilize a network of tolling manufacturers in various regions in the production cycle of certain specialty starches. In general, these tolling manufacturers produce certain basic starches for us and we in turn complete the manufacturing process of starches through our finishing channels. 
​
We believe our approach to production and service, which focuses on local management and production improvements of our worldwide operations, provides us with a unique understanding of the cultures and product requirements in each of the geographic markets in which we operate. This allows us to bring added value to our customers through tailored, innovative solutions. At the same time, we believe that our corporate functions give us the ability to identify synergies and maximize the benefits of our global presence.
​
Products
​
Our portfolio of products is generally classified into the following categories: Starch Products, Sweetener Products, and Co-products and others. Within these categories, a portion of our products are considered specialty ingredients and we refer to the remainder of our products as core ingredients. We describe these three general product categories in more detail below, along with a broader discussion of specialty ingredients within the product portfolio. 
​
Starch Products: Our starch products represented approximately 45 percent, 46 percent and 46 percent of our net sales for each of 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Starches are an important component in a wide range of processed foods, where they are used for adhesion, clouding, dusting, expansion, fat replacement, freshness, gelling, glazing, mouthfeel, stabilization and texture. Cornstarch is sold to cornstarch packers for sale to consumers. Starches are also used in paper production to create a smooth surface for printed communications and to improve strength in recycled papers. Specialty starches are used for enhanced drainage, fiber retention, oil and grease resistance, improved printability and biochemical oxygen demand control. The textile industry uses starches and specialty starches for sizing (abrasion resistance) to provide size and finishes for manufactured products. Industrial starches are used in the production of construction materials, textiles, adhesives, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, as well as in mining, water filtration, and oil and gas drilling. Specialty starches are used for biomaterial applications including biodegradable plastics, fabric softeners and detergents, hair and skin care applications, dusting powders for surgical gloves, and in the production of glass fiber and insulation.
​

4



Sweetener Products: Our sweetener products represented approximately 33 percent, 35 percent and 36 percent of our net sales for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sweeteners include products such as glucose syrups, high maltose syrup, high fructose corn syrup, dextrose, polyols, maltodextrin, glucose syrup solids and non-GMO (genetically modified organism) syrups. Our sweeteners are used in a wide variety of food and beverage products, such as baked goods, snack foods, canned fruits, condiments, candy and other sweets, dairy products, ice cream, jams and jellies, prepared mixes, table syrups, soft drinks, fruit-flavored drinks and many others. These sweetener products also offer functionality in addition to sweetness, such as texture, body and viscosity; help control freezing points, crystallization and browning; add humectancy (ability to add moisture) and flavor; and act as binders. Our high maltose syrups speed the fermentation process, allowing brewers to increase capacity without adding capital. Dextrose has a wide range of applications in the food and confection industries, in solutions for intravenous (“IV”) and other pharmaceutical applications, and in numerous industrial applications like wallboard, biodegradable surface agents and moisture control agents. Our specialty sweeteners provide affordable, natural, reduced calorie and sugar-free solutions for our customers. 
​
Co-products and others: Co-products and others accounted for approximately 22 percent, 19 percent and 18 percent of our net sales for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Refined corn oil (from germ) is sold to packers of cooking oil and to producers of margarine, salad dressings, shortening, mayonnaise and other foods. Corn gluten feed is sold as animal feed. Corn gluten meal is sold as high-protein feed for chickens, pet food and aquaculture. Our other products include fruit and vegetable products, such as concentrates, purees and essences, as well as pulse proteins and hydrocolloids systems and blends.
​
Specialty Ingredients within the product portfolio: Within our three product portfolios, we consider certain of our products to be specialty ingredients. Specialty ingredients accounted for approximately 33 percent of our net sales for 2021, up from 32 percent and 30 percent for 2020 and 2019, respectively. These ingredients deliver more functionality than our other products and add additional customer value. Our specialty ingredients are aligned with growing market and consumer trends such as health and wellness, clean-label, simple ingredients, affordability, indulgence and sustainability. 
​
We drive growth for our specialty ingredients portfolio by leveraging the following growth platforms:
​
Starch-based Texturizers: These ingredients support the structure and texture behind great eating experiences. Products are made from corn, potato, rice and tapioca, and offer a multitude of textures, functionalities and stability during processing and shelf life to a broad range of food products. 
​
Clean and Simple Ingredients: These functional ingredients address the clean label trend for finished products made with shorter lists of food ingredients that have achieved broad consumer acceptance. From food and beverages to pet food and personal care, consumers are looking for clean, simple, natural and authentic products that they can identify and trust. The broad portfolio of clean label ingredients includes starches, sweeteners, flours, nutrition ingredients, emulsifiers and fruit and vegetable concentrates. 
​
Sugar Reduction and Specialty Sweeteners: These solutions provide sweetness or functional replacement for sugar in reduced-calorie and sugar-free foods and beverages without sacrificing quality and consistency. These specialty ingredients are made from a variety of GMO and non-GMO raw material bases and include such ingredients as plant-based stevia sweeteners, polyols, dextrose and allulose, a rare sugar. 
 ​
Food Systems: These systems deliver ingredient combinations that simplify a customer’s production cycle. A food system can address an array of functional challenges including mouthfeel/texture for dairy and alternative dairy products, thickening of sauces, stabilization in high-protein drinks, gelling for fruit fillings, film formers for candy shells, foaming and frothing, adding soluble fibers and nutritional ingredients, adhering particles to breads, and emulsification of flavors.
​
Plant-based Proteins: These specialty pulse-based protein ingredients bring solutions made from lentils, chickpeas, fava beans and peas. They add protein, dietary fiber, micronutrients and texture to food and beverages. 
​

5



Core ingredients within the product portfolio: We refer to the remainder of our starch products, sweetener products and co-products that do not fall into specialty ingredients, as defined above, as core ingredients. Core ingredients accounted for approximately 67 percent of our net sales for 2021, down from 68 percent and 70 percent in 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
​
Competition
​
The starch and sweetener industry is highly competitive. Competition within our markets is largely based on product functionality, price and quality. Many of our products are viewed as basic ingredients that compete with virtually identical products and derivatives manufactured by other companies in the industry. The U.S. is a highly competitive market with operations by other starch processors, several of which are divisions of larger enterprises. Some of these competitors, unlike us, have vertically integrated their starch processing and other operations. Competitors include Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (“ADM”), Cargill, Inc. (“Cargill”), Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. (“Tate & Lyle”) and several others. Our operations in Mexico and Canada face competition from U.S. imports and local producers including ALMEX, a Mexican joint venture between ADM and Tate & Lyle. In South America, Cargill conducts starch processing operations in Brazil and Argentina. We also face competition from Roquette Frères S.A. (“Roquette”) primarily in our EMEA, North America and Asia-Pacific regions. Many smaller local corn and tapioca processors also operate in some of our markets.
​
Several of our products also compete with products made from raw materials other than corn. High fructose corn syrup and monohydrate dextrose compete principally with cane and beet sugar products. Co-products such as corn oil and gluten meal compete with products of the corn dry milling industry and with soybean oil, soybean meal and other products. Fluctuations in prices of these competing products may affect prices of, and profits derived from, our products.
​
Customers
​
We supply a broad range of customers in over 60 industries worldwide. The following table shows the approximate portion of total net sales by industry for each of the industries we served in 2021:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​

​
No customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales in 2021, 2020 or 2019.
​
Raw Materials
​
Corn (primarily yellow dent) is the primary basic raw material we use to produce starches and sweeteners. The price of corn, which is determined by reference to prices on the Chicago Board of Trade, fluctuates as a result of various factors including: farmers’ planting decisions, climate, domestic and foreign government policies (including those related to the production of ethanol), livestock feeding, shortages or surpluses of world grain supplies and trade agreements. We use chips and slices from potato processors as the primary raw material to manufacture potato-based starches. We also use tapioca, gum, rice, plant-based stevia, peas and sugar as raw materials. The supply of raw materials has been, and is anticipated to continue to be, adequate for our needs.
​
Corn is also grown in other areas of the world, including China, Brazil, Europe, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa, Canada and Pakistan. Our subsidiaries outside the U.S. utilize both local supplies of corn and corn imported from 

6



other geographic areas, including the U.S. The supply of corn for these subsidiaries is also generally expected to be adequate for our needs. Corn prices for our non-U.S. subsidiaries generally fluctuate as a result of the same factors that affect U.S. corn prices.
​
We also utilize specialty grains such as waxy and high amylose corn, as well as proprietary seed varietals in our operations. In general, the planning cycle for our specialty grain sourcing begins three years in advance of the anticipated delivery of the specialty corn since the necessary seed must be grown in the season before we contract to buy the grain. To secure these specialty grains at the time of our anticipated needs, we contract with certain farmers to grow the specialty corn approximately two years in advance of delivery. These specialty grains have a higher cost due to their more limited supply and require longer planning cycles to mitigate the risk of supply shortages.
​
Due to the competitive nature of our industry and the availability of substitute products not produced from corn, such as sugar from cane or beets, end-product prices may not necessarily fluctuate in a timely manner that correlates to raw material costs of corn.
​
We use derivative hedging contracts to protect the gross margin of our firm-priced business primarily in North America, and we follow a policy of hedging our exposure to commodity price fluctuations with commodities futures and options contracts primarily for certain of our North American corn purchases. Other operations may or may not be hedged at any given time based on management’s judgment as to the need to fix the costs of our raw materials to protect our profitability. Outside North America, we generally enter short-term commercial sales contracts and adjust our selling prices based upon the local raw material costs. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information.
​
Other raw materials used in our manufacturing processes include chips and slices from potato processors as the primary raw material to manufacture potato-based starches. We also use tapioca, particularly in certain of our production processes in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition to corn, potatoes, and tapioca, we use pulses, gums, rice, plant-based stevia, yellow peas and sugar as raw materials, among others.
​
Research and Development
​
Our global network of approximately 500 scientists creates innovative food solutions in 32 Ingredion Idea Labs® with headquarters in Bridgewater, New Jersey. Activities at Bridgewater include plant science and physical, chemical and biochemical modifications to food formulations, food sensory evaluation and development of non-food applications such as starch-based biopolymers. In addition, we have product application technology centers that direct our product development teams worldwide to create product application solutions to better serve the ingredient needs of our customers. Product development activity is focused on developing product applications for identified customer and market needs. Through this approach, we have developed value-added products for use by customers in various industries. We usually collaborate with customers to develop the desired product application either in the customers’ facilities, our technical service laboratories, or on a contract basis. 
​
Our research and development (“R&D”) is supported by our marketing, product technology, and technology support staff, as well as technical support services to assist our customers with application development and co-creation. We invest in R&D and digital transformation solutions to support new product development and innovation, to enable greater value delivery to our customers, to reduce waste and lower our costs and to drive operational excellence.
​
Sales and Distribution
​
Our salaried sales personnel, who are generally dedicated to customers in a geographic region, sell our products directly to manufacturers and distributors. In addition, we have staff that provides technical support to our sales personnel on an industry basis. We generally contract with trucking companies to deliver our bulk products to customer destinations. In North America, we generally use trucks to ship to nearby customers. For those customers located considerable distances from our manufacturing facilities, we primarily use either rail or a combination of railcars and trucks to deliver our products.

BRGs, which we have implemented across our global operations, play an essential role in connecting employees across regions, providing them with opportunities to enhance cultural awareness and enable collaboration, and inform our strategies for a broad consumer marketplace.
​
In addition, we have joined the Paradigm for Parity® coalition, pledging our commitment to achieving gender parity in corporate leadership roles by 2030. As of December 31, 2021, women accounted for more than 25 percent of both Ingredion’s Board of Directors and its Executive Leadership team. We have committed under the Paradigm for Parity Action Plan to significantly increase the number of women in senior operating roles. 
​
Additionally, Ingredion has been included for five years in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (“GEI”), a modified market capitalization-weighted index that aims to track the performance of public companies committed to transparency in gender-data reporting. This reference index measures gender equality across five pillars: female leadership & talent pipeline, equal pay & gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies and pro-women brand. The 2022 GEI included 418 companies across 45 countries and regions, including firms headquartered in Colombia and Uruguay for the first time.
​
To continue to attract, develop and retain top talent, Ingredion employs a variety of tools and strategies to assess capabilities, identify skills gaps and provide growth and advancement opportunities based on the needs of the business and our employees. Our total approach to compensation and benefits rewards our employees based on their respective overall contribution to the business. In addition, we regularly assess employee engagement levels and proactively seek continuous improvement in the workplace.

Government Regulation
​
As a manufacturer and marketer of food items and items for use in the pharmaceutical industry, our operations and the use of many of our products are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local statutes and regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act. We and many of our products are also subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Among other things, applicable regulations prescribe requirements and establish standards for product quality, purity and labeling. Failure to comply with one or more regulatory requirements can result in a variety of sanctions, including monetary fines. No such fines of a material nature were imposed on us in 2021. We may also be required to comply with federal, state, foreign and local laws regulating food handling and storage. We believe these laws and regulations have not negatively affected our competitive position.
​
Our operations are also subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations for environmental matters, including air and water quality, as well as other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. We operate industrial boilers that fire natural gas, coal, or biofuels to operate our manufacturing facilities. Those boilers, along with product dryers, are our primary source of greenhouse gas emissions.
​
During 2021, we spent approximately $27 million for environmental control and wastewater treatment equipment to be incorporated into existing facilities and in planned construction projects. We currently anticipate that we will invest approximately $29 million for environmental facilities and programs in 2022.
​
Based on current laws and regulations and their enforcement and interpretation, we do not expect that the costs of future environmental compliance will be a material expense, although there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance or that the costs of remaining in compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations.
