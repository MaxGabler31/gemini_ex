Business Overview

J. C. Penney Company, Inc. is a holding company whose principal operating subsidiary is J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. (JCP). JCP was incorporated in Delaware in 1924, and J. C. Penney Company, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 2002, when the holding company structure was implemented. The new holding company assumed the name J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (Company). The holding company has no independent assets or operations, and no direct subsidiaries other than JCP. Common stock of the Company is publicly traded under the symbol “JCP” on the New York Stock Exchange. The Company is a co-obligor (or guarantor, as appropriate) regarding the payment of principal and interest on JCP’s outstanding debt securities. The guarantee by the Company of certain of JCP’s outstanding debt securities is full and unconditional. The holding company and its consolidated subsidiaries, including JCP, are collectively referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as “we,” “us,” “our,” “ourselves,” “Company” or “JCPenney.”

Since our founding by James Cash Penney in 1902, we have grown to be a major retailer, operating 864 department stores in 49 states and Puerto Rico as of February 2, 2019. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years, rather than to calendar years. Fiscal year 2018 ended on February 2, 2019; fiscal year 2017 ended on February 3, 2018; and fiscal year 2016 ended on January 28, 2017. Fiscal years 2018 and 2016 consisted of 52 weeks and fiscal year 2017 consisted of 53 weeks.

Our business consists of selling merchandise and services to consumers through our department stores and our website at jcpenney.com, which utilizes fully optimized applications for desktop, mobile and tablet devices. Our department stores and website generally serve the same type of customers, our website offers virtually the same mix of merchandise as our store assortment plus other extended categories that are not offered in store, and our department stores generally accept returns from sales made in stores and via our website. We fulfill online customer purchases by direct shipment to the customer from our distribution facilities and stores or from our suppliers' warehouses and by in store customer pick up. We primarily sell family apparel and footwear, accessories, fine and fashion jewelry, beauty products through Sephora inside JCPenney, and home furnishings. In addition, our department stores provide our customers with services such as styling salon, optical, portrait photography, and custom decorating. 

Based on how we categorized our divisions in 2018, our merchandise mix of total net sales over the last three years was as follows: 

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Women’s apparel | 22 | % | | 22 | % | 23 | %

Competition and Seasonality

The business of selling merchandise and services is highly competitive. We are one of the largest department store and e-commerce retailers in the United States, and we have numerous competitors, as further described in Item 1A, Risk Factors. Many factors enter into the competition for the consumer’s patronage, including merchandise assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, location, shipping times and cost, online and mobile user experience, reputation, credit availability, customer loyalty, availability of in-store services such as styling salon, optical, portrait photography and custom decorating, and the ability to offer personalized customer experiences. Our annual earnings depend to a great extent on the results of operations for the last quarter of the fiscal year, which includes the holiday season, when a significant portion of our sales and profits are recorded.

We consider our marks and the accompanying name recognition to be valuable to our business. 
Website Availability

We maintain an Internet website at www.jcpenney.com and make available free of charge through this website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all related amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after the materials are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, our website provides press releases, access to webcasts of management presentations and other materials useful in evaluating our Company.
Suppliers

We have a diversified supplier base, both domestic and foreign, and are not dependent to any significant degree on any single supplier. We purchase our merchandise from approximately 2,900 domestic and foreign suppliers, many of whom have done business with us for many years. In addition to our Plano, Texas home office, we, through our purchasing subsidiary, maintained buying and quality assurance offices in 9 foreign countries as of February 2, 2019. 
Employment

The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 95,000 full-time and part-time employees as of February 2, 2019.

Environmental Matters

Environmental protection requirements did not have a material effect upon our operations during 2018. It is possible that compliance with such requirements (including any new requirements) would lengthen lead time in expansion or renovation plans and increase construction costs, and therefore operating costs, due in part to the expense and time required to conduct environmental and ecological studies and any required remediation.

As of February 2, 2019, we estimated our total potential environmental liabilities to be $19 million and recorded our estimate in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date. This estimate covered potential liabilities primarily related to underground storage tanks and remediation of environmental conditions involving our former drugstore locations. We continue to assess required remediation and the adequacy of environmental reserves as new information becomes available and known conditions are further delineated. If we were to incur losses at the estimated amount, we do not believe that such losses would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
