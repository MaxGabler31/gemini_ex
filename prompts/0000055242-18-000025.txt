End users of these products include producers and suppliers in equipment-intensive operations such as coal mining, road construction, quarrying, oil and gas exploration, refining, production and supply.
Unless otherwise specified, any reference to a “year” refers to our fiscal year ending on June 30.
BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW The Company operates in three segments: Industrial, Widia and Infrastructure. The Company's reportable operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company's internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities, the manner in which we organize segments for making operating decisions and assessing performance and the availability of separate financial results. Sales and operating income by segment are presented in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in Item 7 of this Annual Report (MD&A). Additional segment data is provided in Note 20 of our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report which is incorporated herein by reference.
INDUSTRIAL In the Industrial segment, we focus on customers in the transportation, general engineering, aerospace and defense market sectors, delivering high performance metalworking tools for specified purposes. Our customers in these end markets use our products and services in the manufacture of engines, airframes, automobiles, trucks, ships and various other types of industrial equipment. The technology and customization services we provide vary by customer, application and industry. Industrial goes to market under the Kennametal® brand through its direct sales force, a network of independent and national chain distributors, integrated supplier channels and via the Internet. Application engineers and technicians are critical to the sales process and directly assist our customers with specified product design, selection, application and support. 
WIDIA In the Widia segment, we offer a focused assortment of standard and custom metal cutting solutions to general engineering, aerospace, energy and transportation customers. We serve our customers primarily through a network of value added resellers, integrated supplier channels and via the Internet. Widia markets its products under the WIDIA®, WIDIA Hanita® and WIDIA GTD® brands.
INFRASTRUCTURE In the Infrastructure segment, we focus on customers in the energy and earthworks market sectors that support primary industries such as oil and gas, power generation and chemicals; underground, surface and hard-rock mining; highway construction and road maintenance; and process industries such as food and feed. Our success is determined by our ability to gain an in-depth understanding of our customers’ engineering and development needs, to provide complete system solutions and high-performance capabilities to optimize and add value to their operations. Infrastructure markets its products primarily under the Kennametal® brand and sells through a direct sales force as well as through distributors.
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS During 2018, we generated 59 percent of our sales in markets outside of the United States of America (U.S.), with principal international operations in Western Europe, Asia and Canada. We also operate manufacturing and distribution facilities in Israel, Latin America and South Africa, while serving customers through sales offices, agents and distributors in Eastern Europe and other parts of the world. While geographic diversification helps to minimize the sales and earnings impact of demand changes in any one particular region, our international operations are subject to normal risks of doing business globally, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in social, political and economic environments.

Our international assets and sales are presented in Note 20 of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report and are incorporated herein by reference. Further information about the effects and risks of currency exchange rates is presented in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section, as set forth in Item 7A of this Annual Report.
STRATEGY AND GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS In fiscal 2018, we continued making progress on our three initiatives to transform the Company through growth, simplification and modernization. While each of these initiatives will continue during the coming years, we have made significant achievements in each of these areas.
Growth

• | Transitioning customers from the direct to indirect channel to both improve customer service and refocus our direct sales force on larger accounts, enabling our commercial team to grow sales on an account basis


• | Continued development and refining of our channel strategy


• | Implementing customer classification and customer relationship management (CRM) software for sales planning and strategy

Simplification and Modernization

• | Reducing the number of stock keeping units, powder formulations, grades and coatings to reduce manufacturing and supply chain complexity


• | Enforcing our established minimum order quantities and economic order quantities to improve manufacturing efficiency


• | Initiated Industrial segment headcount reduction actions expected to deliver annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $10 million within the first half of fiscal 2019


• | Completed our legacy restructuring programs in fiscal 2018, achieving ongoing annualized savings of approximately $165 million


• | Multi-year modernization program for our manufacturing facilities still in early stages


• | Modernization of Rogers, Arkansas facility, largely complete

Markets were more positive than in the prior year and exceeded the expectations we set when we embarked on fiscal 2018. Total sales growth was 15.0 percent with year-over-year growth in all segments, end markets and regions, reflecting not only continued strong end market demand but improving commercial execution. We delivered fiscal 2018 results in-line with our multi-year profitability improvement plan. We also expect fiscal 2019 to be on-track and represent another significant step forward in improved profitability and growth for the company.
The cost savings achieved through our restructuring programs do not include the anticipated benefits from our Modernization initiative. The results of these programs are anticipated to accrue to the Company over the next three years. At the same time, we continue to focus on cash flow and liquidity to support our planned investments. Our operating flexibility was enhanced with an amendment to our five-year, multi-currency, revolving credit facility that increased borrowing capacity from $600.0 million to $700.0 million and was extended to June 2023. Further, on June 7, 2018, we completed the offering of $300.0 million of 4.625 percent Senior Unsecured Notes due June 15, 2028. Net proceeds were used for redemption of our previously outstanding $400.0 million of 2.650 percent Senior Unsecured Notes with an original maturity of November 1, 2019 in July 2018. Further discussion and analysis of the development of our business is set forth in MD&A.
ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES We continue to evaluate new opportunities for the expansion of our existing product lines into new market areas where appropriate. We also continue to evaluate opportunities for the introduction of new and/or complementary product offerings into new and/or existing market areas where appropriate. In the near term, we expect to continue to grow our business and further enhance our market position through the investment opportunities that exist within our core businesses, though we may evaluate acquisition opportunities that have the potential to strengthen or expand our business.
RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES Our major metallurgical raw materials consist of tungsten ore concentrates and scrap carbide, which is used to make tungsten oxide, as well as compounds and secondary materials such as cobalt. Although an adequate supply of these raw materials currently exists, our major sources for raw materials are located abroad and prices fluctuate at times. We have entered into extended raw material supply agreements and expect to implement product price increases as necessary to mitigate rising costs. For these reasons, we exercise great care in selecting, purchasing and managing availability of raw materials. We also purchase steel bars and forgings for making toolholders and other tool parts, as well as for producing rotary cutting tools and accessories. We purchase products for use in manufacturing processes and for resale from thousands of suppliers located in the U.S. and abroad. Our internal capabilities provide access to additional sources of raw materials and offer tungsten carbide recycling capabilities, and therefore, help mitigate our reliance on third parties. Although the trade environment is evolving, we currently do not expect tariffs to have a material effect on our sales or cost structure.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Our product development efforts focus on providing solutions to our customers’ manufacturing challenges and productivity requirements. Our product development program provides discipline and focus to the product development process by establishing “gateways,” or sequential tests, during the development process to remove inefficiencies and accelerate improvements. This program speeds and streamlines development into a series of actions and decision points, combining efforts and resources to produce new and enhanced products faster. It is designed to assure a strong link between customer requirements and corporate strategy, and to enable us to gain the full benefits of our investment in new product development. 
We hold a number of patents and trademarks which, in the aggregate, are material to the operation of our businesses. The duration of our patent protection varies throughout the world by jurisdiction. 
Research and development expenses included in operating expense totaled $38.9 million, $38.0 million and $39.4 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
SEASONALITY Our business is affected by seasonal variations to varying degrees by traditional summer vacation shutdowns of customers’ plants and holiday shutdowns that affect our sales levels during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year.
BACKLOG Our backlog of orders generally is not significant to our operations.
COMPETITION As one of the world’s leading producers of metalworking tools and specialty wear-resistant components and coating solutions, we maintain a leading competitive position in major markets worldwide. We continually strengthen our competitive position by developing new and innovative metalworking and earth cutting products and services, innovative surface and wear solutions and innovative products for mining, construction and road milling applications among many others. We actively compete in the sale of all our products with several large global competitors and with many smaller niche businesses offering various capabilities to customers around the world. While several of our competitors are divisions of larger corporations, our industry remains largely fragmented, containing several hundred fabricators, toolmakers and niche specialty coating businesses. Many of our competitors operate relatively small facilities, producing a limited selection of tools while buying cemented tungsten carbide components from original producers of cemented tungsten carbide products, including Kennametal. We also supply coating solutions and other engineered wear-resistant products to both larger corporations and smaller niche businesses. Given the fragmentation, opportunities for consolidation exist from both U.S.-based and internationally-based firms, as well as among thousands of industrial supply distributors.
The principal competitive differentiators in our businesses include customer focused support and application expertise, custom and standard product innovation, product performance and quality, as well as service, pricing and productivity delivered ascribed to our brands. We derive competitive advantage from our premium brand positions, global presence, application expertise and ability to address unique customer needs with new and improved tools, innovative surface and wear solutions, highly engineered components, consistent quality, traditional and digital customer service and technical assistance capabilities, state-of-the-art manufacturing and multiple sales channels. With these strengths, we are able to sell products based on the value-added productivity we deliver to our customers, rather than competing solely on price.
REGULATION From time to time, we are a party to legal claims and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, which may relate to our operations or assets, including real, tangible, or intellectual property assets. While we currently believe that the amount of ultimate liability, if any, we may face with respect to these actions will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain. Were an unfavorable outcome to occur or if protracted litigation were to ensue, the impact on us could be material.
Compliance with government laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials or pollutants into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position for the years covered by this Annual Report, nor is such compliance expected to have a material effect on us in the future.
Among other environmental laws, we are subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (Superfund), under which we have been designated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as a potentially responsible party (PRP) with respect to environmental remedial costs at certain Superfund sites. We have evaluated our claims and potential liability associated with these Superfund sites based upon the best information currently available to us. We believe our environmental accruals will be adequate to cover our portion of the environmental remedial costs at those Superfund sites where we have been designated a PRP, to the extent these expenses are probable and reasonably estimable.
6

Reserves for other potential environmental liabilities at June 30, 2018 and 2017 were $12.5 million and $12.4 million, respectively. The reserves that we have established for our potential environmental liabilities represent our best current estimate of the costs of addressing all identified environmental situations, based on our review of currently available evidence, taking into consideration our prior experience in environmental remediation and the experiences of other companies, as well as public information released by the USEPA, other governmental agencies, and by the PRP groups in which we are participating. Although our reserves currently appear to be sufficient to cover our potential environmental liabilities, there are uncertainties associated with environmental remediation matters, and we can give no assurance that our estimate of any environmental liability will not increase or decrease in the future. Our reserved and unreserved liabilities for environmental matters could change substantially due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination, changes in remedial requirements, technological changes, discovery of new information, the financial strength of other PRPs, the identification of new PRPs and the involvement of and direction taken by the U.S. government on these matters.
We maintain a Corporate Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Department to monitor our compliance with environmental regulations and to oversee our remediation activities. In addition, we have designated EHS coordinators who are responsible for each of our manufacturing facilities. Our financial management team periodically meets with members of the Corporate EHS Department and the Corporate Legal Department to review and evaluate the status of environmental projects and contingencies. On a quarterly basis, we review financial provisions and reserves for environmental contingencies and adjust these reserves when appropriate.
EMPLOYEES We employed approximately 10,500 people at June 30, 2018, of which approximately 3,400 were located in the U.S. and 7,100 were located in other parts of the world, principally Europe, Asia Pacific and India. At June 30, 2018, approximately 3,200 of our employees were represented by labor unions. We consider our labor relations to be generally good.

RISK FACTORS
This section describes material risks to our business that are currently known to us. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially affected by a number of factors. Our management regularly monitors the risks inherent in our business, with input and assistance from our Enterprise Risk Management department. In addition to real time monitoring, we periodically conduct a formal enterprise-wide risk assessment to identify factors and circumstances that might present significant risk to the Company. Many of these risks are discussed throughout this report. The risks below, however, are not exhaustive. We operate in a rapidly changing environment. Other risks that we currently believe to be immaterial could become material in the future. We are also subject to legal and regulatory changes. New factors could emerge, and it is not possible to predict the outcome of all such risk factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The following discussion details the material risk factors and uncertainties that we believe could cause Kennametal’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.

Downturns in the business cycle could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Our business has historically been cyclical and subject to significant impact from economic downturns. Global economic downturn coupled with global financial and credit market disruptions have had a negative impact on our sales and profitability historically. These events could contribute to weak end markets, a sharp drop in demand for our products and services and higher costs of borrowing and/or diminished credit availability. Although we believe that the long-term prospects for our business remain positive, we are unable to predict the future course of industry variables or the strength and pace or sustainability of economic development. 
Our restructuring efforts may not have the intended effects. We recently completed our legacy multi-year restructuring programs, and in the future may implement additional programs to improve our manufacturing costs and operating expenses. However, there is no assurance that these efforts, or that any other actions that we have taken or may take, will be sufficient to counter any future economic or industry disruptions. We cannot provide assurance that we will not incur additional restructuring charges or impairment charges, or that we will achieve all of the anticipated benefits from the restructuring actions we have taken or plan to take in the future. If we are unable to effectively restructure our operations in the light of evolving market conditions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our modernization initiative began in fiscal 2017. The purpose of this initiative is to invest in our plants, equipment and processes to automate and lower our overall labor cost. These capital investments are expected to result in substantial savings from reduced labor, maintenance and supply costs, while at the same time improving the quality of our products. We cannot provide any assurances that we will achieve all of the anticipated savings from these planned actions. These initiatives are expected to put pressure on our cash flows for the near-term. Further, as demand has grown faster than initially expected, it is possible that we may not be able to modernize fast enough to keep up with demand in select locations, causing us to keep direct hourly employment in certain circumstances somewhat higher than previously anticipated. If we are unable to effectively execute our plans, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our international operations pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings. We have manufacturing operations and assets located outside of the U.S., including but not limited to those in Western Europe, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Israel and South Africa. We also sell our products to customers and distributors located outside of the U.S. During the year ended June 30, 2018, 59 percent of our consolidated sales were derived from non-U.S. markets. These international operations are subject to a number of special risks, in addition to the risks of our domestic operations, including currency exchange rate fluctuations, differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulations, labor unrest, risk of governmental expropriation, domestic and foreign customs and tariffs, current and changing regulatory environments (including, but not limited to, the risks associated with the importation and exportation of products and raw materials), risk of failure of our foreign employees to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust laws, trade regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, difficulty in obtaining distribution support, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differences in the availability and terms of financing, political instability and unrest and risks of increases in taxes. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. To the extent we are unable to effectively manage our international operations and these risks, our international sales may be adversely affected, we may be subject to additional and unanticipated costs, and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory action. As a consequence, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.
Changes in the regulatory environment, including environmental, health and safety regulations, could subject us to increased compliance and manufacturing costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Health and Safety Regulations. Certain of our products contain hard metals, including tungsten and cobalt. Hard metal dust is being studied for potential adverse health effects by organizations in several regions throughout the world, including the U.S., Europe and Japan. Future studies on the health effects of hard metals may result in our products being classified as hazardous to human health, which could lead to new regulations in countries in which we operate that may restrict or prohibit the use of, and/or exposure to, hard metal dust. New regulation of hard metals could require us to change our operations, and these changes could affect the quality of our products and materially increase our costs.
8

Environmental Regulations. We are subject to various environmental laws, and any violation of, or our liabilities under, these laws could adversely affect us. Our operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges to air and water, handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for noncompliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or exposure to, hazardous materials. We could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under these laws. We may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future. If more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Regulations affecting the mining and drilling industries or utilities industry. Some of our principal customers are mining and drilling companies and utility companies. Many of our mining and drilling customers supply coal, oil, gas or other fuels as a source of energy to utility companies in the U.S. and other industrialized regions. The operations of these mining and drilling companies are geographically diverse and are subject to or affected by a wide array of regulations in the jurisdictions where they operate, such as applicable environmental laws and regulations governing the mining and drilling industry and the utilities industry. As a result of changes in regulations and laws relating to these industries, our customers’ operations could be disrupted or curtailed by governmental authorities. The high cost of compliance with these regulations may also induce customers to discontinue or limit their operations, and may discourage companies from developing new opportunities. As a result of these factors, demand for our mining- and drilling-related products could be substantially affected by regulations adversely impacting the mining and drilling industries or altering the consumption patterns of utilities. 
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives could result in a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. At June 30, 2018, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $319.4 million, or 11 percent of our total assets. Goodwill results from acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. We assess at least annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our continued success depends on our ability to protect and defend our intellectual property. Our future success depends in part upon our ability to protect and defend our intellectual property. We rely principally on nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements and trade secret laws and, to a lesser extent, trademark and patent laws, to protect our intellectual property. However, these measures may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property from infringement by others or prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. If one of our patents is infringed upon by a third party, we may need to devote significant time and financial resources to defend our rights with respect to such patent. We may not be successful in defending our patents. Similarly, while we do not knowingly infringe on the patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others, we may be required to spend a significant amount of time and financial resources to resolve any infringement claims against us, and we may not be successful in defending our position or negotiating alternative remedies. Our inability to protect our proprietary information and enforce or defend our intellectual property rights in proceedings initiated by us or brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Failure of, or a breach in security of, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. We rely on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives. Any disruption of our infrastructure could negatively impact our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Any disruption could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate.
In recent years, cybersecurity attacks have become more sophisticated and more prevalent. A security breach of our information technology systems could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation. In addition, we could be subject to liability if confidential information relating to customers, employees, vendors and the extended supply chain or other parties is misappropriated from our computer system. We do not believe we have been the target of a material successful cyber attack. While we have dedicated increased resources to fortify our security measures, our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, human error, programming errors or similar disruptive problems. Therefore, we cannot assure that our system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any cyber attack or network disruption.
9

We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our domestic and foreign operations are subject to significant competitive pressures. We compete directly and indirectly with other manufacturers and suppliers of metalworking tools, engineered components and advanced materials. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater access to financial resources or be less leveraged than us. In addition, the industry in which our products are used is a large, fragmented industry that is highly competitive.
If we are unable to retain our qualified management and employees, our business may be negatively affected. Our ability to provide high quality products and services depends in part on our ability to retain our skilled personnel in the areas of management, product engineering, servicing and sales. Competition for such personnel is intense, and our competitors can be expected to attempt to hire our management and skilled employees from time to time. In addition, our restructuring activities and strategies for growth have placed, and are expected to continue to place, increased demands on our management’s skills and resources. If we are unable to retain our management team and professional personnel, our customer relationships and level of technical expertise could be negatively affected, which may materially and adversely affect our business.
Any interruption of our workforce, including interruptions due to our restructuring initiatives, unionization efforts, changes in labor relations or shortages of appropriately skilled individuals could impact our business. 
Our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the prices and availability of raw materials. The raw materials we use for our products include tungsten ore concentrates and scrap carbide, which is used to make tungsten oxide, as well as compounds and secondary materials such as cobalt. A significant portion of our raw materials is supplied by sources outside of the U.S. The raw materials industry as a whole is highly cyclical and at times pricing and supply can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including natural disasters, general economic and political conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs and currency exchange rate fluctuations. This volatility can significantly affect our raw material costs. In an environment of increasing raw material prices, competitive conditions can affect how much of these price increases we can recover in the form of higher sales prices for our products. To the extent we are unable to pass on any raw material price increases to our customers, our profitability could be adversely affected. Furthermore, restrictions in the supply of tungsten, cobalt and other raw materials could adversely affect our operating results. If the prices for our raw materials increase or we are unable to secure adequate supplies of raw materials on favorable terms, our profitability could be impaired. If the prices for our raw materials decrease, we could face product pricing challenges.
Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business. The sale of metalworking, mining, highway construction and other tools and related products as well as engineered components and advanced materials entails an inherent risk of product liability claims. We cannot give any assurances that the coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate or that our policies will cover any particular loss. Insurance can be expensive, and we may not always be able to purchase insurance on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Claims brought against us that are not covered by insurance or that result in recoveries in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may not be able to complete, manage or integrate acquisitions successfully. We have acquired companies in the past and we may continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that have the potential strengthen or expand our business. We can give no assurances, however, that any acquisition opportunities will arise or if they do, that they will be consummated, or that additional financing, if needed, will be available on satisfactory terms. In addition, acquisitions involve inherent risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with our expectations. We may not be able to achieve the synergies and other benefits we expect from the integration of acquisitions as successfully or rapidly as projected, if at all. Our failure to consummate an acquisition or effectively integrate newly acquired operations could prevent us from realizing our expected strategic growth and rate of return on an acquired business and could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Natural disasters or other global or regional catastrophic events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect results. Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions to us through business continuity planning, we still may be exposed to interruptions due to catastrophe, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism or acts of war, which are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and stock price could be adversely affected.
