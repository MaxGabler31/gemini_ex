Item 1.    Business
Overview
CVR Energy, Inc. is a diversified holding company formed in September 2006 which is primarily engaged in the petroleum refining and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing industries through its holdings in CVR Refining, LP, which was a publicly traded limited partnership prior to January 29, 2019 (the “Petroleum Segment” or “CVR Refining”), and CVR Partners, LP, a publicly traded limited partnership (the “Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment” or “CVR Partners”). CVR Refining is an independent petroleum refiner and marketer of high value transportation fuels. CVR Partners produces and markets nitrogen fertilizers in the form of UAN and ammonia. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “CVR Energy”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our” generally include CVR Refining, CVR Partners, and their respective subsidiaries, as consolidated subsidiaries of the Company, subject to certain exceptions where there are transactions or obligations between and among CVR Refining, CVR Partners, and CVR Energy, including their respective subsidiaries. Refer to “Petroleum” and “Nitrogen Fertilizer” below for further details on our two business segments.
Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “CVI,” and CVR Partners’ common units are listed on the NYSE under the symbol “UAN.” As of December 31, 2021, Icahn Enterprises L.P. and its affiliates (“IEP”) owned approximately 71% of our outstanding common stock. 
As of December 31, 2021, we owned the general partner and approximately 36% of the outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in CVR Partners, with the public owning the remaining outstanding common units of CVR Partners.
As of December 31, 2021, we owned the general partner and all outstanding common units of CVR Refining, including the common units of CVR Refining that we or our subsidiaries purchased on January 29, 2019 from unaffiliated common unitholders following the assignment by CVR Refining’s general partner to us of its right to purchase all such common units (the “Public Unit Purchase”) and from IEP pursuant to an agreement containing substantially similar terms as the Public Unit Purchase (the “Affiliate Unit Purchase” and together with the Public Unit Purchase, the “CVRR Unit Purchase”). As a result of the CVRR Unit Purchase, CVR Refining’s common units were delisted effective January 29, 2019, and its reporting obligations under Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act were suspended as of February 8, 2019. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 1 (“Organization and Nature of Business”) of this Report for further discussion of the CVRR Unit Purchase. 
Our History
The following graphic depicts the Company’s history and key events that have occurred since the Company’s formation.
Petroleum
Our Petroleum Segment is composed of the assets and operations of CVR Refining, including two refineries located in Coffeyville, Kansas and Wynnewood, Oklahoma and supporting logistics assets in the region. 
December 31, 2021 | 



Facilities
Coffeyville Refinery - We own a complex full coking, medium-sour crude oil refinery in southeast Kansas, approximately 100 miles from Cushing, Oklahoma (“Cushing”) with a name plate crude oil capacity of 132,000 bpd (the “Coffeyville Refinery”). The major operations of the Coffeyville Refinery include fractionation, catalytic cracking, hydrotreating, reforming, coking, isomerization, alkylation, sulfur recovery, and propane and butane recovery operating units. The Coffeyville Refinery benefits from significant refining unit redundancies, which include two crude oil distillation and vacuum towers, two sulfur recovery units, and five hydrotreating units. These redundancies allow the Coffeyville Refinery to continue to receive and process crude oil even if one tower requires maintenance without having to shut down the entire refinery. In addition, Coffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing, LLC (“CRRM”), a subsidiary of CVR Refining, has a hydrogen sale agreement with Coffeyville Resources Nitrogen Fertilizer, LLC (“CRNF”), a subsidiary of CVR Partners, where a fixed monthly volume of hydrogen is sold as part of the Coffeyville Master Service Agreement (the “Coffeyville MSA”). 
In May 2021, CVR Energy’s board of directors (the “Board”) approved the completion of the design for a potential conversion of an existing hydrotreater at our Coffeyville Refinery to renewable diesel service.
Wynnewood Refinery - We own a complex crude oil refinery in Wynnewood, Oklahoma approximately 65 miles south of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and approximately 130 miles from Cushing with a name plate crude oil capacity of 74,500 bpd capable of processing 20,000 bpd of light sour crude oil (the “Wynnewood Refinery” and together with the Coffeyville Refinery, the “Refineries”). The major operations of the Wynnewood Refinery include fractionation, hydrocracking, hydrotreating, reforming, solvent deasphalting, alkylation, sulfur recovery, and propane and butane recovery operating units. Similar to the Coffeyville Refinery, the Wynnewood Refinery benefits from unit redundancies, including two crude oil distillation and vacuum towers and four hydrotreating units. 
In December 2020, the Board approved a renewable diesel project at our Wynnewood Refinery, which would convert the Wynnewood Refinery’s hydrocracker to an RDU capable of producing 100 million gallons of renewable diesel per year and approximately 170 to 180 million RINs annually. Currently, total estimated cost for the project is $170 million. Mechanical completion and startup of the RDU is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2022. As a result of the conversion of the hydrocracker to an RDU, the crude oil capacity of the Wynnewood Refinery would be reduced by approximately 4,500 bpd to 70,000 bpd. However, we may continue to choose to operate the Wynnewood Refinery in conventional hydrocracking mode instead of renewable diesel mode depending on which is most favorable economically.
In May 2021, CVR Energy’s board of directors (the “Board”) approved a $10 million capital expenditure for the completion of the design and ordering of certain long-lead equipment relating to a potential project to add pretreating capabilities for the RDU at our Wynnewood Refinery. In November 2021, the Board approved a project to install a renewable feedstock pretreatment unit at the Wynnewood Refinery, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 at an estimated cost of $60 million. The pretreatment unit should enable us to process a wider variety of renewable diesel feedstocks at the Wynnewood Refinery, most of which have a lower carbon intensity than soybean oil and currently generate additional low carbon fuel standard credits.

Supply
December 31, 2021 | 



The Coffeyville Refinery has the capability to process a variety of crude oils ranging from heavy sour to light sweet crude oil. Currently, the Coffeyville Refinery crude oil slate consists of a blend of mid-continent domestic grades and various Canadian medium and heavy sours and other similarly sourced crudes. Other blendstocks include ethanol, biodiesel, normal butane, natural gasoline, alkylation feeds, naphtha, gas oil, and vacuum tower bottoms. The Wynnewood Refinery has the capability to process a variety of crude oils ranging from medium sour to light sweet crude oil. Isobutane, gasoline components, and normal butane blendstocks are also typically used. 
In addition to the use of third-party pipelines, we have an extensive gathering system consisting of logistics assets that are owned, leased, or part of a joint venture operation. These assets include the following:

 | | As of December 31, 2021
 | Pipeline Segment | Length (miles) | Capacity (bpd)

(1)CVR Refining owns a 50% interest in the Midway JV and a 40% interest in the Enable JV. While CVR Refining has the ability to exercise influence through its participation on the board of directors of each of the Midway JV and the Enable JV, it does not serve as the day-to-day operator. We have determined that these entities should not be consolidated and apply the equity method of accounting. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 3 (“Equity Method Investments”) of this Report for further discussion of these investments.
(2)In support of our Coffeyville Refinery, we own and operate a tank storage facility in close proximity to the Coffeyville Refinery (the “East Tank Farm”).
For the acquisition of crude oil within close proximity of the Refineries, we operate a fleet of approximately 127 trucks and have contracts with third-party trucking fleets to acquire and deliver crude oil to our pipeline system or directly to the Refineries for consumption or resale. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the gathering system, which includes the pipelines outlined above and our trucking operations, supplied approximately 38% and 92% of the Coffeyville and Wynnewood Refineries’ crude oil demand, respectively. Regionally sourced crude oils delivered to the Refineries usually have a transportation cost advantage compared to other domestic or international crudes given the Refineries’ proximity to the producing areas. However, sometimes slightly heavier and more sour crudes may offer improved economics to the Refineries, 
December 31, 2021 | 9



notwithstanding the higher transportation costs. The regionally-sourced crude oils we purchase are light and sweet enough to allow the Refineries to blend higher percentages of lower cost crude oils, such as heavy Canadian sour, to optimize economics within operational constraints.
Crude oils sourced outside of our gathering system are delivered to Cushing by various third-party pipelines, including the Keystone and Spearhead pipelines on which we can be subject to proration, and subsequently to the Broome Station facility via the Midway JV pipeline. From the Broome Station facility, crude oil is delivered to the Coffeyville Refinery via the Petroleum Segment’s 170,000 bpd proprietary pipeline system. Crude oils are delivered to the Wynnewood Refinery through third-party and joint venture pipelines and received into storage tanks at terminals located within or near the refinery. We also lease tank storage totaling 2.2 million barrels, including 2.0 million barrels at Cushing.
We acquired the Blueknight Energy Partners, LP pipelines (the “BKEP / CRCT Pipeline System”) in February 2021, which complemented the Petroleum Segment’s existing refineries and pipeline systems. The BKEP / CRCT Pipeline System is based in the Wynnewood area. This new system consists of gathering pipelines, which provide the ability to deliver local crude oil to the Wynnewood Refinery. In addition to the gathering capability, the BKEP / CRCT Pipeline System also provides the optionality to deliver and/or receive crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma on two separate lines.
The Coffeyville Refinery is connected to the mid-continent natural gas liquid commercial hub at Conway, Kansas by the inbound Enterprise Pipeline Blue Line. Natural gas liquid blendstocks, such as butanes and natural gasoline, are sourced and delivered directly into the refinery. In addition, Coffeyville Refinery’s proximity to Conway provides access to the natural gas liquid and liquid petroleum gas fractionation and storage capabilities.
Through the crude oil and other feedstock supply operations outlined above, and the associated markets available to us, we are able to source and refine crude oils from different locations and of different compositions when it is economically advantageous to do so. The tables below present the total crude throughput by refinery for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:

Marketing and Distribution
Our Coffeyville product marketing efforts are focused in the central mid-continent area through rack marketing, which is the supply of product through tanker trucks and railcars directly to customers located in close geographic proximity to the refinery and to customers at terminals on third-party refined products distribution systems; and bulk sales into the mid-continent markets and other destinations utilizing third-party product pipeline networks. 
The Wynnewood Refinery ships its finished product via pipeline, railcar, and truck, focusing its efforts in Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, as well as eastern Missouri. The pipeline system used by the Wynnewood Refinery is capable of multi-directional flow, providing access to Texas markets as well as adjoining states with pipeline connections. The Wynnewood Refinery also sells jet fuel to the U.S. Department of Defense via its segregated truck rack.
Customers
Customers for the Refineries’ petroleum products primarily include retailers, railroads, farm cooperatives, and other refiners/marketers in Group 3 of the PADD II region because of their relative proximity to the Refineries and pipeline access. We typically sell bulk products to long-standing customers at spot market prices based on a Group 3 basis differential to prices quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) subject to other terms or adjustments, which are reported by industry market-related indices such as Platts and Oil Price Information Service (“OPIS”).
Rack sales are at posted prices that are influenced by the competitive forces in Group 3 of the PADD II region among other factors. In addition, the Coffeyville Refinery sells hydrogen and by-products of its refining operations, such as pet coke, to an affiliate, CRNF, which is wholly owned by CVR Partners, pursuant to multi-year agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Petroleum Segment’s top customer accounted for 16% of its net sales. 
Competition
Our Petroleum Segment competes primarily on the basis of price, reliability of supply, availability of multiple grades of products, and location. The principal competitive factors affecting its refining operations are cost of crude oil and other 
December 31, 2021 | 



feedstocks, refinery complexity, refinery efficiency, refinery product mix, product distribution and transportation costs, and costs of compliance with government regulations, including the Renewable Fuel Standards (“RFS”). The locations of the Refineries provides us with a reliable supply of crude oil and a transportation cost advantage over our competitors. We primarily compete against CHS Inc.’s McPherson Refinery; Holly Frontier Corporation’s El Dorado Refinery, Tulsa East and West Refineries; Phillips 66 Company’s Ponca Refinery; and Valero Energy Corporation’s Ardmore Refinery in the mid-continent region. In addition to these refineries, we compete against trading companies, as well as other refineries located outside the region that are linked to the mid-continent market through product pipeline systems, including those near the Gulf Coast, the Great Lakes, and the Texas panhandle regions. 
Seasonality
Our Petroleum Segment operations experience seasonal fluctuations as demand for gasoline products is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and road construction work. Demand for diesel fuel is higher during the planting and harvesting seasons. As a result, our results of operations for the Petroleum Segment for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower compared to our results for the second and third calendar quarters. In addition, unseasonably cool weather in the summer months and/or unseasonably warm weather in the winter months in the markets in which we sell petroleum products can impact the demand for gasoline and diesel fuel. 
Nitrogen Fertilizer
Our Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment is composed of the assets and operations of CVR Partners, including two nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities located in Coffeyville, Kansas and East Dubuque, Illinois.
Facilities
Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility - We own and operate a nitrogen fertilizer production facility in Coffeyville, Kansas that includes a gasifier complex having a capacity of 89 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen, a 1,300 ton per day capacity ammonia unit, and a 3,000 ton per day capacity UAN unit (the “Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility”). The Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility is the only nitrogen fertilizer plant in North America that utilizes a pet coke gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer. The Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility’s largest raw material expense used in the production of ammonia is pet coke, which it purchases from our Coffeyville Refinery and third parties. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility purchased approximately $23 million, $18 million, and $20 million, respectively, of pet coke, which equaled an average cost per ton of $44.69, $35.25, and $37.47, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we upgraded approximately 87%, 87%, and 90%, respectively, of our ammonia production into UAN, a product that generated greater profit than ammonia for both 2021 and 2019 but, did not for 2020. When the economics are favorable, we expect to continue upgrading substantially all of our ammonia production into UAN. 
East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility - We own and operate a nitrogen fertilizer production facility in East Dubuque, Illinois that includes a 1,075 ton per day capacity ammonia unit and a 1,100 ton per day capacity UAN unit (the “East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility”). The East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility has the flexibility to vary its product mix, enabling it to upgrade a portion of ammonia production into varying amounts of UAN, nitric acid, and liquid and granulated urea, depending on market demand, pricing, and storage availability. The East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility’s largest raw material expense used in the production of ammonia is natural gas, which it purchases from third parties. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility incurred approximately $32 million, $20 million, and $20 million for feedstock natural gas used in production, respectively, which equaled an average cost of $3.95, $2.31, and $2.88 per MMBtu, respectively.
Commodities
The nitrogen products we produce are globally traded commodities and are subject to price competition. The customers for CVR Partners’ products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. The selling prices of its products fluctuate in response to global market conditions, feedstock costs, and changes in supply and demand.
December 31, 2021 | 



Agriculture 
The three primary forms of nitrogen fertilizer used in the United States are ammonia, urea, and UAN. Unlike ammonia and urea, UAN can be applied throughout the growing season and can be applied in tandem with pesticides and herbicides, providing farmers with flexibility and cost savings. As a result of these factors, UAN typically commands a premium price to urea and ammonia, on a nitrogen equivalent basis. However, during 2020, UAN commanded a discount price to urea and premium to ammonia, on a nitrogen equivalent basis.
Nutrients are depleted in soil over time and, therefore, must be replenished through fertilizer application. Nitrogen is the most quickly depleted nutrient and must be replenished every year, whereas phosphate and potassium can be retained in soil for up to three years. Plants require nitrogen in the largest amounts, and it accounts for approximately 59% of primary fertilizer consumption on a nutrient ton basis, per the International Fertilizer Industry Association (“IFIA”).
Demand
Global demand for fertilizers is driven primarily by grain demand and prices, which, in turn, are driven by population growth, farmland per capita, dietary changes in the developing world and increased consumption of bio-fuels. According to the IFIA, from 1976 to 2019, global fertilizer demand grew 2% annually. Global fertilizer use, consisting of nitrogen, phosphate and potash, is projected to increase by 1% through 2023 to meet global food demand according to a study funded by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. Currently, the developed world uses fertilizer more intensively than the developing world, but sustained economic growth in emerging markets is increasing food demand and fertilizer use. In addition, populations in developing countries are shifting to more protein-rich diets as their incomes increase, with such consumption requiring more grain for animal feed. As an example, China’s wheat and coarse grains production is estimated to have increased 40% between 2011 and 2021, but still failed to keep pace with increases in demand, prompting China to grow its wheat and coarse grain imports by more than 1,452% over the same period, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”).
The United States is the world’s largest exporter of coarse grains, accounting for 29% of world exports and 27% of world production for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, according to the USDA. A substantial amount of nitrogen is consumed in production of these crops to increase yield. Based on Fertecon Limited’s (“Fertecon”) 2021 estimates, the United States is the world’s third largest consumer of nitrogen fertilizer and the world’s largest importer of nitrogen fertilizer. Fertecon is a reputable agency which provides market information and analysis on fertilizers and fertilizer raw materials for fertilizer and related industries, as well as international agencies. Fertecon estimates indicate that the United States represented 12% of total global nitrogen fertilizer consumption for 2021, with China and India as the top consumers representing 22% and 15% of total global nitrogen fertilizer consumption, respectively. 
North American nitrogen fertilizer producers predominantly use natural gas as their primary feedstock. Over the last five years, U.S. oil and natural gas reserves have increased significantly due to, among other factors, advances in extracting shale oil and gas, as well as relatively high oil and gas prices. More recently, European and Asian natural gas prices have increased significantly since 2020 due to reduced production volumes and higher global demand, as economies began to recover from the global COVID-19 pandemic. In Europe, the increase in natural gas prices as a feedstock has caused multiple fertilizer plant shut-ins, and certain European countries have curtailed industrial natural gas usage, resulting in deteriorated economics for producing fertilizers in the region. In addition, China and Russia have restricted exports of fertilizers in order to ensure domestic availability. In North America, natural gas prices also increased throughout 2021, but higher nitrogen fertilizer prices more than offset the rise in natural gas costs. As a result, North America continues to be the low-cost region for nitrogen fertilizer production.
Raw Material Supply
Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility - During the past five years, just under 48% of the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility’s pet coke requirements on average were supplied by our adjacent Coffeyville Refinery pursuant to a multi-year agreement. Historically, the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility has obtained the remainder of its pet coke requirements through third-party contracts typically priced at a discount to the spot market. In 2021, 2020, and 2019, our supply of pet coke from the Coffeyville Refinery declined to approximately 43%, 33%, and 40%, respectively, generally attributable to increased processing of shale crude oil, which reduced the amount of pet coke produced by the refinery and increased the amount of third-party purchases made at spot prices. 
December 31, 2021 | 



With increased reliance on third-party pet coke, we have contracts with four vendors, which could be delivered by truck, railcar or barge.
Additionally, our Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility relies on a third-party air separation plant at its location that provides contract volumes of oxygen, nitrogen, and compressed dry air to the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility gasifiers. The reliability of the air separation plant can have a significant impact on our Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility operations. In 2020, to mitigate future impacts, we executed a new product supply agreement that obligates the counterparty to invest funds to upgrade its facility to reduce downtime over the next several years. Should the oxygen volume fall below a specified level, the on-site vendor will provide excess oxygen through its own mechanism or through third-party purchases.
East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility - The East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility uses natural gas to produce nitrogen fertilizer. We are generally able to purchase natural gas at competitive prices due to the facility’s connection to the Northern Natural Gas interstate pipeline system, which is within one mile of the facility, and a third-party owned and operated pipeline. The pipelines are connected to a third-party distribution system at the Chicago Citygate receipt point and at the Hampshire interconnect from which natural gas is transported to the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility. As of December 31, 2021, we had commitments to purchase approximately 1 million MMBtus of natural gas supply for planned use in our East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility in both January and February of 2022 at a weighted average rate per MMBtu of approximately $5.96 and $5.95, respectively, exclusive of transportation cost.
Marketing and Distribution
Our Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment primarily markets UAN products to agricultural customers and ammonia products to agricultural and industrial customers. UAN and ammonia, including freight, accounted for approximately 65% and 28%, respectively, of our Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment’s net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
UAN and ammonia are primarily distributed by truck or railcar. If delivered by truck, products are most commonly sold on a free-on-board (“FOB”) shipping point basis, and freight is normally arranged by the customer. We operate a fleet of railcars for use in product delivery. If delivered by railcar, products are most commonly sold on a FOB destination point basis, and we typically arrange the freight. 
The nitrogen fertilizer products leave the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility either in railcars for destinations located principally on the Union Pacific or Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroads or in trucks for direct shipment to customers. The East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility primarily sells product to customers located within 200 miles of the facility. In most instances, customers take delivery of nitrogen products at the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility and arrange to transport them to their final destinations by truck. Additionally, the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility has direct access to a barge dock on the Mississippi River, as well as a nearby rail spur serviced by the Canadian National Railway Company.
Customers
Retailers and distributors are the main customers for UAN and, more broadly, the industrial and agricultural sectors are the primary recipients of our ammonia products. Given the nature of our nitrogen fertilizer business, and consistent with industry practice, we sell our products on a wholesale basis under a contract or by purchase order. Contracts with customers generally contain fixed pricing and most have terms of less than one year. Some of our industrial sales include long-term purchase contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment’s top customer represented 13% of the its net sales. 
Competition
Our Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment produces globally traded commodities and has competitors in every region of the world. The industry is dominated by price considerations, which are driven by raw material and transportation costs, currency fluctuations and trade barriers. Our Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment has experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant levels of competition from domestic and foreign nitrogen fertilizer producers, many of whom have significantly greater financial and other resources. During the spring and fall fertilizer application periods in the United States, farming activities intensify and geographic proximity to these activities is also a significant competitive advantage for domestic producers. We manage our manufacturing and distribution operations to best serve our customers during these critical periods.

Subject to location and other considerations, our major competitors in the nitrogen fertilizer business include CF Industries Holdings, Inc., including its majority owned subsidiary Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P.; LSB Industries, Inc.; Koch Fertilizer Company, LLC; and Nutrien Ltd. Domestic competition is intense due to customers’ sophisticated buying tendencies and competitor strategies that focus on cost and service. We also encounter competition from producers of fertilizer products manufactured in foreign countries, including the threat of increased production capacity. In certain cases, foreign producers of fertilizer who export to the United States may be subsidized by their respective governments. 
Seasonality
Because the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment primarily sells agricultural commodity products, its business is exposed to seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products in the agricultural industry. In addition, the demand for fertilizers is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers who make planting decisions based largely on the prospective profitability of a harvest. The specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like crop prices, farmers’ current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns, and the types of crops planted. The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment typically experiences higher net sales in the first half of the calendar year, which is referred to as the planting season, and its net sales tend to be lower during the second half of each calendar year, which is referred to as the fill season.
Environmental Matters
Our petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations governing the emission and release of regulated substances into the environment, the transportation, storage, and disposal of waste, the treatment and discharge of wastewater and stormwater, the storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum and nitrogen products, and the characteristics and composition of gasoline, diesel fuels, UAN, and ammonia. These laws and regulations and the enforcement thereof impact our segments and their operations by imposing:
•restrictions on operations or the need to install enhanced or additional control and monitoring equipment;
•liability for the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at current and former facilities (if any) and for off-site waste disposal locations; and
•specifications for the products marketed by the Petroleum and Nitrogen Fertilizer Segments, primarily gasoline, diesel fuel, UAN, and ammonia.
Our operations require numerous permits, licenses, and authorizations. Failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties, or other sanctions or a revocation of our permits, licenses, or authorizations. In addition, the laws and regulations to which we are subject are often evolving and many of them have or could become more stringent or have or could become subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement by federal or state agencies. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating, and compliance costs.
The Federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”)
The CAA and its implementing regulations, as well as corresponding state laws and regulations governing air emissions, affect the Petroleum and Nitrogen Fertilizer Segments both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts may occur through the CAA’s permitting requirements and/or emission control and monitoring requirements relating to specific air pollutants, as well as the requirement to maintain a risk management program to help prevent accidental releases of certain regulated substances. The CAA affects the Petroleum and Nitrogen Fertilizer Segments by extensively regulating the air emissions of sulfur dioxide (“SO2”), volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and other substances, including those emitted by mobile sources, which are direct or indirect users of our products. Some or all of the regulations promulgated pursuant to the CAA, or any future promulgations of regulations, may require the installation of controls or changes to the petroleum facilities and/or the nitrogen fertilizer facilities (collectively referred to as the “Facilities”) to maintain compliance. If new controls or changes to operations are needed, the costs could be material.
The regulation of air emissions under the CAA requires that we obtain various construction and operating permits and incur capital expenditures for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at our operations. Various standards and programs specific to our operations have been implemented, such as the National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants, the New Source Performance Standards, and the New Source Review.

The EPA regulates greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions under the CAA. In October 2009, the EPA finalized a rule requiring certain large emitters of GHGs to inventory and report their GHG emissions to the EPA. In accordance with the rule, our Facilities monitor and report our GHG emissions to the EPA. In May 2010, the EPA finalized the “Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule,” which established GHG emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources, such as the Refineries and the nitrogen fertilizer facilities, must obtain permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V programs of the CAA. Under the rule, facilities already subject to the PSD and Title V programs that increase their emissions of GHGs by a significant amount are required to undergo PSD review and to evaluate and implement air pollution control technology, known as “best available control technology,” to reduce GHG emissions. 
The Biden Administration has signaled that it will take steps to address climate change. On January 20, 2021, the White House issued its Executive Order titled “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis,” as well as a formal notification re-accepting entry of the United States into the Paris Agreement. On January 27, 2021, the White house issued another climate-related Executive Order, titled “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad.” On April 22, 2021, the Biden Administration announced a new target for the United States to achieve a 50 to 52 percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG emissions in 2030.
The EPA’s approach to regulating GHG emissions may change, including under future administrations. Therefore, the impact on our Facilities due to GHG regulation is unknown.
Recent Greenhouse Gas Footprint Reduction Efforts
In October 2020, the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment announced that it generated its first carbon offset credits from voluntary nitrous oxide abatement at its Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility. The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment has similar nitrous oxide abatement efforts at its East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility. According to the EPA, nitrous oxide represents approximately 7% of carbon dioxide-equivalent (“CO2e”) emissions in the United States.
The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment previously entered into a Joint Development Agreement with ClimeCo, a developer of emission-reduction projects for nitric acid plants, to jointly design, install and operate a tertiary abatement system at one of its nitric acid plants in Coffeyville. The system was designed to abate 94% of all N2O in the unit while preventing the release of approximately 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent on an annualized basis. The N2O abatement systems at the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility’s two nitric acid plants have abated, on average, the annual release of approximately 265,000 metric tons of CO2e during the past five years. 
CVR Partners’ N2O abatement projects are registered with the Climate Action Reserve (the “Reserve”), a carbon offset registry for the North American market. The Reserve employs high-quality standards and an independent third-party verification process to issue its carbon credits, known as Climate Reserve Tonnes.
The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment also sequesters carbon dioxide that is not utilized for urea production at its Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility by capturing and purifying the CO2 as part of its manufacturing process and then transfers it to its partner, CapturePoint LLC (formerly Perdure Petroleum LLC), that compresses and ships the CO2 for sequestration through Enhanced Oil Recovery (“EOR”). In January 2021, the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations under Section 45Q which provides tax credits to encourage CO2 sequestration. We believe that our process for CO2 sequestration would qualify for tax credits under Section 45Q and intend to pursue a claim of those credits starting in 2022.
Combining our nitrous oxide abatement and CO2 sequestration activities should reduce our CO2e footprint by over 1 million metric tons per year. In addition, our Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility is uniquely qualified to produce hydrogen and ammonia that could be certified ‘blue’ to a market that is increasingly demanding reduced carbon footprints. These greenhouse gas footprint reduction efforts support our core Values of Environment and Continuous Improvement, and our goal of continuing to produce nitrogen fertilizers that feed the world’s growing population in the most environmentally responsible way possible.
Renewable Fuel Standard
Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (“EISA”), the EPA has promulgated the RFS, which requires refiners to either blend “renewable fuels,” such as ethanol and biofuels, into their 
December 31, 2021 | 



transportation fuels or purchase renewable fuel credits, known as renewable identification numbers (“RINs”), in lieu of blending. Under the RFS, the volume of renewable fuels that refineries like Coffeyville and Wynnewood are obligated to blend into their finished transportation fuel is adjusted annually by the EPA based on expected fuel demand and other conditions to meet the statutory mandates that increase annually, but which may be waived by the EPA under certain conditions. The volume of renewable fuels required by EISA increased from 9 billion gallons in 2008 to 33 billion gallons in 2021. The EPA has statutory authority to determine RFS volumes after 2022. In addition to the total renewable fuel volume mandate, the regulation includes sub-mandates for advanced biofuel, cellulosic biofuel, and biomass-based diesel. Under the cellulosic waiver authority provided to the EPA by the CAA, if the EPA’s projected volume of cellulosic biofuel production for a calendar year is less than its statutory mandate, the EPA must reduce the required volume of cellulosic biofuel accordingly and provide obligated parties the opportunity to purchase cellulosic waiver credits. The EPA also has the discretion to reduce the total renewable fuel and advanced biofuel requirements by the same amount as it reduced the cellulosic biofuel volume. The Petroleum Segment (like many refiners) is not able to meet its annual renewable volume obligation (“RVO”) through blending, so it has had to purchase RINs on the open market as well as obtain cellulosic waiver credits from the EPA, in order to comply with the RFS. The cost of purchasing RINs and cellulosic waiver credits fluctuates and can be significant. The price of RINs became extremely volatile when the EPA’s proposed renewable fuel volume mandates approached and exceeded the “blend wall.” The blend wall refers to the point at which the amount of ethanol required to be blended into the gasoline supply exceeds the level at which most engines can safely run on gasoline blended with ethanol. The blend wall is generally considered to be reached when more than 10 percent ethanol by volume (“E10”) is blended into gasoline. The volatility of RIN prices also increased significantly in response to a number of uncertainties regarding the implementation of the RFS program in 2020, 2021, and has continued into 2022.
In May 2019, the EPA finalized regulatory changes to allow gasoline blended with up to 15 percent ethanol (“E15”) to take advantage of a waiver during the summer months that previously only applied to E10, which meant that E15 could be sold year-round rather than just eight months of the year. However, in June 2019, the rule was challenged in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”). The D.C. Circuit ultimately overturned the E15 rule in July 2021, after which ethanol industry groups appealed the decision in the U.S. Supreme Court. On January 10, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the appeal, upholding the D.C. Circuit’s vacatur of the E15 rule.
On December 7, 2021, the EPA proposed a package of actions setting renewable blending volumes for 2020, 2021, and 2022 (the “2020-2022 Volumes Proposal”). First, the 2020-2022 Volumes Proposal includes proposed renewable blending volumes for 2021 and 2022, after the EPA failed to meet its statutory deadlines to set the 2021 and 2022 renewable volume obligations by November 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The proposed volume requirements are 18.52 billion gallons for 2021 and 20.77 billion gallons for 2022. Second, the 2020-2022 Volumes Proposal would lower the previously established renewable fuel volume requirements for 2020 from 20.09 billion gallons to 17.13 billion gallons. The D.C. Circuit consolidated cases challenging various aspects of the previously established renewable fuel volume requirements for 2020, and the biomass-based diesel volume for 2021, remains active, but it is unknown at this time how those cases will be resolved in light of the EPA’s proposed modifications to the 2020 renewable volume requirements.
Third, the proposal also partially reissues the 2016 renewable fuel volumes in response to a July 2017 D.C. Circuit decision (1) vacating the EPA’s decision to reduce the 2016 volumes under its “inadequate domestic supply” waiver authority and (2) remanding to the EPA for reissuance of the 2016 renewable fuels volumes. Specifically, the EPA proposes a supplemental volume of 250 million gallons in 2022 and states its intention to propose an additional supplemental volume of 250 million gallons for 2023 in a subsequent action. 
Finally, the proposal utilizes the CAA “reset” authority to reduce volumes for each 2020, 2021, and 2022. Under the reset provision, if the EPA waives the statutory volumes for any of the four fuel categories by at least 20% for two consecutive years or by at least 50% for a single year, then the EPA must modify the statutory volumes for all subsequent years for that fuel category. The reset has been triggered in previous years for both advanced biofuel and cellulosic biofuel, but this is the first time the EPA has applied the reset authority.
The final 2020-2022 volumes might differ from the proposal, and will determine the Coffeyville Refinery’s and, unless exempted, the Wynnewood Refinery’s renewable volume obligations. 
On February 2, 2022, the EPA issued a final rule to extend the 2019 RFS compliance deadline for small refineries and the 2020 and 2021 RFS compliance deadlines for all obligated parties. The deadlines are tied to the date on which the 2021 renewable blending volumes are finalized. The EPA also issued a new method for determining RFS compliance deadlines for 
December 31, 2021 | 



2022 and beyond, under which the deadlines would automatically be extended in the event the EPA fails to promulgate the annual renewable fuel volumes by the deadline provided in the CAA. Unless overturned, this new rule alters the deadlines by which the Coffeyville Refinery and, unless exempted, the Wynnewood Refinery must comply with the RFS obligations. CRRM and WRC filed a Petition for Review of this final rule with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on February 4, 2022, which Petition for Review remains pending. 
Additional RFS-related rulemakings and administrative actions may occur and, if finalized, would impact the Coffeyville Refinery’s and Wynnewood Refinery’s obligations under the RFS. First, the EPA issued a document entitled Proposed RFS Small Refinery Exemption Decision (“Proposed Denial”), announcing that the EPA is changing its statutory interpretation of the CAA and, applying this new interpretation, proposing to deny 65 SRE petitions currently pending before the agency. Second, on January 3, 2022, the EPA informed small refineries (including WRC’s Wynnewood Refinery) that the Agency is considering including the 2018 small refinery hardship petitions in the Proposed Denial. The EPA’s review of the 2018 petitions follows the D.C. Circuit’s December 8, 2021, order granting the EPA’s motion for voluntary remand of all of the 2018 hardship decisions, and imposing a deadline of April 7, 2022, for the EPA to act on remand. The EPA requested comments on the Proposed Denial by February 7, 2022. The EPA’s action on the pending 2019, 2020, and 2021 hardship petitions, and its review of the 2018 hardship petition, will impact the Wynnewood Refinery’s renewable volume obligations.
The Federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”)
The CWA and its implementing regulations, as well as the corresponding state laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the water, affect the Petroleum and Nitrogen Fertilizer Segments. The CWA’s permitting requirements establish discharge limitations that may be based on technology standards, water quality standards, and restrictions on the total maximum daily load of pollutants allowed to enter a particular water body based on its use. In addition, water resources are becoming more scarce, and many refiners, including us, are subject to use restrictions in the event of low availability conditions. Our Refineries and the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility have contracts in place to receive water during certain water shortage conditions, but these conditions could change over time depending on the scarcity of water.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (“EPCRA”)
The release of hazardous substances or extremely hazardous substances into the environment is subject to release reporting requirements under federal and state environmental laws. Our Facilities also periodically experience releases of hazardous and extremely hazardous substances from their equipment and periodically have excess emission events. From time to time, the EPA has conducted inspections and issued information requests to us with respect to our compliance with reporting requirements under the CERCLA and the EPCRA. If we fail to timely or properly report a release, or if a release violates the law or our permits, we could become the subject of a governmental enforcement action or third-party claims. Government enforcement or third-party claims relating to releases of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances could result in significant expenditures and liability.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”)
Our Facilities are subject to the RCRA requirements for the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. When feasible, RCRA-regulated materials are recycled instead of being disposed of on-site or off-site. RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides governing current waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal practices, the recycling of wastes, and the regulation of underground storage tanks containing regulated substances. 
Impacts of Past Manufacturing - In March 2004, two of our subsidiaries entered into a Consent Decree (“2004 Consent Decree”) with the EPA and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (the “KDHE”) that required us to assume two RCRA corrective action orders issued to Farmland, the prior owner of the Coffeyville Refinery. Until January 21, 2021, we were subject to a 1994 EPA administrative order related to investigation of possible past releases of hazardous materials to the environment at the Coffeyville Refinery. In accordance with the order, we have conducted the required investigation and interim remediation projects and documented existing soil and groundwater conditions. In June 2017, the Coffeyville Refinery submitted an amended RCRA post-closure permit application to the KDHE to complete closure of former hazardous waste management units at the Coffeyville Refinery and to perform corrective action at the site. The KDHE approved the post-closure permit application in July 2019, and the RCRA permit was issued in December 16, 2020. The EPA terminated the 1994

administrative order on January 21, 2021. On January 13, 2021, the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility entered into an agreement with the KDHE to address certain historical releases of UAN located on property held by CRNF that comingled with legacy groundwater contamination from the adjacent Coffeyville Refinery. The cleanup provisions of the agreement with the KDHE are held in abeyance so long as the Coffeyville Refinery conducts corrective action for these comingled historical releases in accordance with CRRM’s RCRA permit. The now-closed Phillipsburg terminal is subject to a 1996 EPA administrative order related to investigation of releases of hazardous materials to the environment at the Phillipsburg terminal, which operated as a refinery until 1991. The Phillipsburg terminal investigation is complete and corrective measures are in place implementing the EPA’s Statement of Basis and Final Remedy Decision issued in July 2018. The Wynnewood Refinery operates under a RCRA permit. A RCRA facility investigation has been completed in accordance with the terms of the permit. Based on the facility investigation and other available information, Wynnewood Refining Company, LLC (“WRC”) entered into a consent order with the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (the “ODEQ”) requiring further investigations of groundwater conditions and enhancements of existing remediation systems. We have completed the groundwater investigation at the Wynnewood Refinery and the ODEQ has approved our ongoing corrective actions. The consent order was terminated by the ODEQ in July 2019.
Financial Assurance - We are required under the 2004 Consent Decree, as modified by a 2010 agreement between CRRM, Coffeyville Resources Terminal, LLC (“CRT”), the EPA, and the KDHE, to establish financial assurance to secure the current projected clean-up cost for the now-closed Phillipsburg terminal. This financial assurance is currently provided by a bond in the amount of $2 million. The $2 million bond amount is reduced each year based on actual expenditures for corrective actions. Additional financial assurance of approximately $6 million and $3 million is required to meet our RCRA financial obligations for the Coffeyville Refinery and Phillipsburg terminal, respectively. Current RCRA financial assurance requirements for the Wynnewood Refinery total $0.3 million for hazardous waste storage tank closure and post-closure monitoring of a closed storm water retention pond. These RCRA financial assurance obligations are currently being satisfied by a surety bond. The Company’s financial assurance mechanisms are re-evaluated and adjusted on an annual basis. In preparation for renewal of its RCRA permit, the Wynnewood Refinery supplied the ODEQ an estimate of the monitoring and clean-up costs anticipated under the reissued RCRA permit. Additional financial assurance of approximately $3 million will be required for the Wynnewood Refinery when the ODEQ issues the renewed RCRA permit. 
Waste Management - There are fourteen closed hazardous waste units at the Coffeyville Refinery. There is one closed hazardous waste unit and one active hazardous waste storage tank at the Wynnewood Refinery. In addition, 30 years of long-term post-closure care was completed at one closed, interim status, hazardous waste landfarm located at the now-closed Phillipsburg terminal and is no longer subject to monitoring.
Environmental Remediation
As is the case with all companies engaged in similar industries, we face potential exposure from claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters, including soil and water contamination and personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by crude oil or hazardous substances that we processed, handled, used, stored, transported, spilled, disposed of, or released. There is no assurance that we will not become involved in future proceedings related to the release of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances or crude oil for which we have potential liability or that, if we were held responsible for damages in any existing or future proceedings, such costs would be covered by insurance or would not be material. 
Environmental Insurance
We are covered by a site pollution legal liability insurance policies, which include business interruption coverage. The policies insure any location owned, leased, rented, or operated by the Company, including the Refineries and the nitrogen fertilizer facilities. The policies insure certain pollution conditions at or migrating from a covered location, certain waste transportation and disposal activities, and business interruption.
In addition to the site pollution legal liability insurance policy, we maintain umbrella and excess casualty insurance policies which include sudden and accidental pollution coverage. This insurance provides coverage due to named perils for claims involving pollutants where the discharge is sudden and accidental and first commences at a specific day and time during the policy period.
The site pollution legal liability policy and the pollution coverage provided in the casualty insurance policies are subject to retentions and deductibles and contain discovery requirements, reporting requirements, exclusions, definitions, conditions, and 
December 31, 2021 | 



limitations that could apply to a particular pollution claim, and there can be no assurance such claim will be adequately insured for all potential damages.
Health, Safety and Security Matters
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to health and safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes, the purposes of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. We also are subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. We are committed to safe, reliable operations of our facilities to protect the health and safety of our employees, our contractors, and the communities in which we operate. Our health and safety management system provides a comprehensive approach to injury, illness and incident prevention, risk assessment and mitigation, and emergency management. Despite our efforts to achieve excellence in our health and safety performance, there can be no assurances that there will not be accidents resulting in injuries or even fatalities.
Our Refineries and the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility are subject to the Chemical Facility Anti-terrorism Standards (“CFATS”), a regulatory program designed to ensure facilities have security measures in place to reduce the risk that certain hazardous chemicals are weaponized by terrorists. In addition, the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility is regulated under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (“MTSA”). We implement and maintain comprehensive security programs designed to comply with regulatory requirements and protect our assets and employees.

We routinely assess risk and conduct audits of our programs and seek to continually improve our health, safety, and security management systems.
