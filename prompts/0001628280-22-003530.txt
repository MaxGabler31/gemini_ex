ITEM 1. Business.
Corporate Overview and Strategy
Chesapeake Utilities Corporation is a Delaware corporation formed in 1947 with operations primarily in the Mid-Atlantic region, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Ohio. We are an energy delivery company engaged in the distribution of natural gas, electricity and propane; the transmission of natural gas; the generation of electricity and steam, and in providing related services to our customers. Our strategy is focused on growing earnings from a stable regulated energy delivery foundation and investing in related businesses and services that provide opportunities for returns greater than traditional utility returns. We seek to identify and develop opportunities across the energy value chain, with emphasis on midstream and downstream investments that are accretive to earnings per share, consistent with our long-term growth strategy and create opportunities to continue our record of top tier returns on equity relative to our peer group. The Company’s growth strategy includes the continued investment and expansion of the Company’s regulated operations that provide a stable base of earnings, as well as investments in other related non-regulated businesses and services including sustainable energy initiatives. By investing in these related business and services, the Company creates opportunities to sustain its track record of higher returns, as compared to a traditional utility.

 (1) Delmarva Natural Gas consists of Delaware division, Maryland division, Sandpiper Energy and Elkton Gas.
 (2) Florida Natural Gas consists of Chesapeake Utilities CFG Division and FPU, and FPU's Ft. Meade and Indiantown divisions. 
Revenues in the Regulated Energy segment are based on rates regulated by the PSC in the states in which we operate or, in the case of Eastern Shore, which is an interstate business, by the FERC. The rates are designed to generate revenues to recover all prudent operating and financing costs and provide a reasonable return for our stockholders. Each of our distribution and transmission operations has a rate base, which generally consists of the original cost of the operation's plant, less accumulated depreciation, working capital and other assets. For Delmarva Natural Gas and Eastern Shore, rate base also includes deferred income tax liabilities and other additions or deductions. Our Regulated Energy operations in Florida do not include deferred income tax liabilities in their rate base.
Our natural gas and electric distribution operations bill customers at standard rates approved by their respective state PSC. Each state PSC allows us to negotiate rates, based on approved methodologies, for large customers that can switch to other fuels. Some of our customers in Maryland receive propane through underground distribution systems in Worcester County. We bill these customers under PSC-approved rates and include them in the natural gas distribution results and customer statistics. 
Our natural gas and electric distribution operations earn profits on the delivery of natural gas or electricity to customers. The cost of natural gas or electricity that we deliver is passed through to customers under PSC-approved fuel cost recovery mechanisms. The mechanisms allow us to adjust our rates on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to recover changes in the cost of the natural gas and electricity that we purchase for customers. Therefore, while our distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of natural gas or electricity we purchase, our distribution adjusted gross margin (which we define as operating revenues less purchased gas or electricity cost) is generally not impacted by fluctuations in the cost of natural gas or electricity. 
Our natural gas transmission operations bill customers under rate schedules approved by the FERC or at rates negotiated with customers. 
Acquisition of Elkton Gas
In July 2020, we closed on the acquisition of Elkton Gas, which provides natural gas distribution service to approximately 7,000 residential and commercial customers within a franchised area of Cecil County, Maryland. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Note 4, Acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements) for further information. The results of Elkton Gas are now included within our Delmarva Natural Gas distribution operations.

In October 2018, Hurricane Michael passed through FPU's electric distribution operation's service territory in Northwest Florida and caused widespread and severe damage to FPU's infrastructure resulting in the loss of electric service to 100 percent of its customers in the Northwest Florida service territory. FPU expended more than $65.0 million to restore service, which was recorded as new plant and equipment, charged against FPU’s accumulated depreciation or charged against FPU’s storm reserve. 
In late 2019, the Florida PSC approved an interim rate increase, subject to refund, effective January 1, 2020, associated with the restoration effort following Hurricane Michael. We fully reserved these interim rates, pending a final resolution and settlement of the limited proceeding. In September 2020, the Florida PSC approved a settlement agreement between FPU and the Office of the Public Counsel regarding final cost recovery and rates associated with Hurricane Michael. The settlement agreement allowed us to: (a) refund the over-collection of interim rates through the fuel clause; (b) record regulatory assets for storm costs in the amount of $45.8 million including interest which will be amortized over six years; (c) recover these storm costs through a surcharge totaling $7.7 million annually; and (d) collect an annual increase in revenue of $3.3 million to recover capital costs associated with new plant investments and a regulatory asset for the cost of removal and unrecovered plant costs. The new base rates and storm surcharge were effective on November 1, 2020. 
In September 2019, FPU filed a petition, with the Florida PSC, for approval of its consolidated electric depreciation rates. The petition was joined to the Hurricane Michael docket, and was approved at the Florida PSC Agenda in September 2020. The approved rates were retroactively applied effective January 1, 2020. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Note 19, Rates and Other Regulatory Activities, in the consolidated financial statements) for further information.

Weather
Weather variations directly influence the volume of natural gas and electricity sold and delivered to residential and commercial customers for heating and cooling and changes in volumes delivered impact the revenue generated from these customers. Natural gas volumes are highest during the winter months, when residential and commercial customers use more natural gas for heating. Demand for electricity is highest during the summer months, when more electricity is used for cooling. We measure the relative impact of weather using degree-days. A degree-day is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls above or below 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Each degree of temperature below 65 degrees Fahrenheit is counted as one heating degree-day, and each degree of temperature above 65 degrees Fahrenheit is counted as one cooling degree-day. Normal heating and cooling degree-days are based on the most recent 10-year average.
Competition
Natural Gas Distribution
While our natural gas distribution operations do not compete directly with other distributors of natural gas for residential and commercial customers in our service areas, we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and alternative fuel providers for sales to industrial customers. Large customers could bypass our natural gas distribution systems and connect directly to intrastate or interstate transmission pipelines, and we compete in all aspects of our natural gas business with alternative energy sources, including electricity, oil, propane and renewables. The most effective means to compete against alternative fuels are lower prices, superior reliability and flexibility of service. Natural gas historically has maintained a price advantage in the residential, commercial and industrial markets, and reliability of natural gas supply and service has been excellent. In addition, we provide flexible pricing to our large customers to minimize fuel switching and protect these volumes and their contributions to the profitability of our natural gas distribution operations. 
Natural Gas Transmission
Our natural gas transmission business competes with other interstate and intrastate pipeline companies to provide service to large industrial, generation and distribution customers, primarily in the northern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula and in Florida. Our transmission business in Ohio, Aspire Energy Express, services one client, Guernsey Power Station, to which it is the sole supplier.
Electric Distribution
While our electric distribution operations do not compete directly with other distributors of electricity for residential and commercial customers in our service areas, we do compete with other electricity suppliers and alternative fuel providers for sales to industrial customers. Some of our large industrial customers may be capable of generating their own electricity, and we structure rates, service offerings and flexibility to retain these customers in order to retain their business and contributions to the profitability of our electric distribution operations. 
 Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2021 Form 10-K Page 7


Supplies, Transmission and Storage
Natural Gas Distribution
Our natural gas distribution operations purchase natural gas from marketers and producers and maintain contracts for transportation and storage with several interstate pipeline companies to meet projected customer demand requirements. We believe that our supply and capacity strategy will adequately meet our customers’ needs over the next several years and we will continue to adapt our supply strategy to meet projected growth in customer demand within our service territories. 
The Delmarva natural gas distribution systems are directly connected to Eastern Shore’s pipeline, which has connections to other pipelines that provide us with transportation and storage. These operations can also use propane-air and liquefied natural gas peak-shaving equipment to serve customers. In March 2020, our Delmarva Peninsula natural gas distribution operations entered into asset management agreements with a third party to manage their natural gas transportation and storage capacity. The agreements were effective as of April 1, 2020 and expire on March 31, 2023. Our Delmarva operations receive a fee, which we share with our customers, from the asset manager, who optimizes the transportation, storage and natural gas supply for these operations.
Our Florida natural gas distribution operation uses Peninsula Pipeline and Peoples Gas to transport natural gas where there is no direct connection with FGT. In November 2020, FPU natural gas distribution and Eight Flags entered into separate 10-year asset management agreements with Emera Energy Services, Inc. to manage their natural gas transportation capacity. An agreement with Florida Southeast Connection LLC commenced in June 2020 for additional service to Palm Beach County for an initial term through December 2044.
A summary of our pipeline capacity contracts follows:

(1) Transco, Columbia Gas and TETLP are interstate pipelines interconnected with Eastern Shore's pipeline
(2) Pursuant to a capacity release program approved by the Florida PSC, all of the capacity under this agreement has been released to various third parties. Under the terms of these capacity release agreements, Chesapeake Utilities is contingently liable to Gulfstream should any party, that acquired the capacity through release, fail to pay the capacity charge. 
Eastern Shore has three agreements with Transco for a total of 7,292 Dts/d of firm daily storage injection and withdrawal entitlements and total storage capacity of 288,003 Dts. These agreements expire in March 2023. Eastern Shore retains these firm storage services in order to provide swing transportation service and firm storage service to customers requesting such services. 
Aspire Energy Express, our Ohio intrastate pipeline subsidiary, entered into a precedent agreement for firm transportation capacity with Guernsey Power Station, who is currently constructing a power generation facility. Aspire Energy Express will provide firm natural gas transportation service to this facility. Guernsey Power Station commenced construction of the project in October 2019. Aspire Energy Express completed construction of the gas transmission facilities to the power generation facility in the fourth quarter of 2021 and expects to begin billing for transportation services in the first quarter of 2022.

Propane Operations 
Our propane operations sell propane to residential, commercial/industrial, wholesale and AutoGas customers, in the Mid-Atlantic region, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida, through Sharp Energy, Inc., Sharpgas, Inc., Diversified Energy, FPU and Flo-gas. We deliver to and bill our propane customers based on two primary customer types: bulk delivery customers and metered customers. Bulk delivery customers receive deliveries into tanks at their location. We invoice and record revenues for these customers at the time of delivery. Metered customers are either part of an underground propane distribution system or have a meter installed on the tank at their location. We invoice and recognize revenue for these customers based on their consumption as dictated by scheduled meter reads. As a member of AutoGas Alliance, we install and support propane vehicle conversion systems for vehicle fleets and provide on-site fueling infrastructure.

Competition
Our propane operations compete with national and local independent companies primarily on the basis of price and service. Propane is generally a cheaper fuel for home heating than oil and electricity but more expensive than natural gas. Our propane operations are largely concentrated in areas that are not currently served by natural gas distribution systems.
Supplies, Transportation and Storage
We purchase propane from major oil companies and independent natural gas liquids producers. Propane is transported by truck and rail to our bulk storage facilities in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida which have a total storage capacity of 8.9 million gallons. Deliveries are made from these facilities by truck to tanks located on customers’ premises or to central storage tanks that feed our underground propane distribution systems. While propane supply has traditionally been adequate, significant fluctuations in weather, closing of refineries and disruption in supply chains, could cause temporary reductions in available supplies.
Weather
Propane revenues are affected by seasonal variations in temperature and weather conditions, which directly influence the volume of propane used by our customers. Our propane revenues are typically highest during the winter months when propane is used for heating. Sustained warmer-than-normal temperatures will tend to reduce propane use, while sustained colder-than-normal temperatures will tend to increase consumption.
Unregulated Energy Transmission and Supply (Aspire Energy)
Aspire Energy owns approximately 2,800 miles of natural gas pipeline systems in 40 counties in Ohio. The majority of Aspire Energy’s revenues are derived from long-term supply agreements with Columbia Gas of Ohio and Consumers Gas Cooperative ("CGC"), which together serve more than 22,000 end-use customers. Aspire Energy purchases natural gas to serve these customers from conventional producers in the Marcellus and Utica natural gas production areas. In October 2021, Aspire Energy completed construction of its Noble Road Landfill RNG pipeline project, which began transporting RNG generated from the landfill to Aspire Energy’s pipeline system in January of 2022, displacing conventionally produced natural gas. The RNG volume is estimated to represent nearly 10 percent of Aspire Energy’s gas gathering volumes in the future. In addition, Aspire Energy earns revenue by gathering and processing natural gas for customers.

Human Capital Initiatives 
Our success is the direct result of our employees and our strong culture that fully engages our team and promotes equity, diversity, inclusion, integrity, accountability and reliability. We believe that a combination of diverse team members and an inclusive culture contributes to the success of our Company and to enhanced societal advancement. Each employee is a valued member of our team bringing a diverse perspective to help grow our business and achieve our goals. Our tradition of serving employees, customers, investors, partners and communities is at the core of our culture. Among the ongoing initiatives across our enterprise, we highlight below the importance of our team, as well as our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our culture of safety, and our environmental, social and governance stewardship. 
Our Team Drives Our Performance
Our employees are the key to our success. Our leadership and human resources teams are responsible for attracting and retaining top talent. In 2021, the Company hired a new Chief Human Resources Officer, with expertise in diverse candidate recruitment, to ensure that we continue to expand our candidate pools to better reflect the diverse demographics of the communities we serve. 
Throughout our organization, we seek to promote from within, reviewing strategic positions regularly and identifying potential internal candidates to fill those positions, evaluating critical job skill sets to identify competency gaps and creating developmental plans to facilitate employee professional growth. We provide training and development programs as well as tuition reimbursement to promote continued professional growth.
As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 1,007 employees, 110 of whom are union employees represented by two labor unions: the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. The 
 Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2021 Form 10-K Page 11


collective bargaining agreements with these labor unions expire in 2022. We consider our relationships with employees, including those covered by collective bargaining agreements, to be in good standing. We provide a competitive Total Rewards package for our employees including health insurance coverage, wellness initiatives, retirement savings benefits, paid time off, employee assistance programs, educational and tuition reimbursement, competitive pay, career growth opportunities, paid volunteer time, and a culture of recognition. In 2021, the Company was recognized as a Top Workplace for the tenth consecutive year. These honors were based entirely on feedback from employees who were surveyed by the research firm ‘Energage’. In early 2022, the Company was recognized nationally as a 2022 Top Workplace USA recipient among mid-sized companies for the second consecutive year. These recognitions are a testament to our employees’ commitment to excellence. Our employees are the backbone of our continued growth and success.
In 2020, we enhanced our diversity initiatives and established an Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (“EDI”) Council. The Council recommends and promotes our EDI strategy, advises employee resource groups (“ERGs”) and works with our operating units and support teams on EDI initiatives. The EDI Council’s charter includes the following objectives: 
•Build a more diverse and inclusive workforce 
•Promote a culture of understanding, equality and inclusion 
•Educate employees about the benefits of diversity at Chesapeake Utilities 
•Support community programs and organizations that are diverse and inclusive 
•Provide guidance on EDI matters for the Company
The Chesapeake Utilities EDI Council includes members of our leadership team, the chairs of each of our ERGs and other individuals in key support roles. The CEO receives a regular report on the achievements of the EDI Council, strategic direction of initiatives, resource needs and issues that require policy decisions or other actions. 
In 2021, there were six active ERGs meeting throughout the Company. Early in 2022, two new ERGs were added. ERGs are voluntary, employee-led groups that focus on shared identities, affinities and experiences and seek to apply those perspectives to initiatives that create value throughout the Company. The ERGs support the members' personal growth and professional development, and help develop learning programs and community service opportunities throughout the Company. ERGs also help foster a sense of belonging by creating a deep and intentional community that extends beyond an employee’s day-to-day team and colleagues into a companywide network.
COVID-19 Response
In March 2020, the United States declared a national emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to this declaration and the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the United States, federal, state and local governments throughout the country imposed varying degrees of restrictions on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the illness. These restrictions significantly impacted economic conditions in the United States in 2020 and continued into 2021. Chesapeake Utilities is considered an “essential business,” which has allowed us to continue operational activities and construction projects while adhering to the social distancing restrictions that were in place. 
Throughout 2021, restrictions continued to be lifted as vaccines have become widely available in the United States. For example, the state of emergency in Florida was terminated in May 2021 followed by Delaware and Maryland in July 2021, resulting in reduced restrictions. The expiration of the states of emergency in our service territories, along with the settlement of our limited proceeding in Florida, has concluded our ability to defer incremental pandemic related costs for consideration through the applicable regulatory process.
We have been closely following the legal process related to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) mandating that all employers, with 100 or more employees, require COVID-19 vaccinations or weekly testing, which made its way to the United States Supreme Court. While OSHA has withdrawn the ETS as a temporary standard following the Supreme Court’s ruling, we will continue to monitor its status as a proposed rule. In light of the continued emergence and growing prevalence of the new variants of COVID-19, such as the Omicron variant, we continue to operate under our pandemic response plan, monitor developments affecting employees, customers, suppliers, and stockholders and take all precautions warranted to operate safely and to comply with the CDC and OSHA standards, in order to protect our employees, customers and the communities we serve. We continue to hold regular companywide all employee calls and leadership meetings with our President and CEO to discuss, among other things, matters pertaining to COVID-19, in addition to distributing frequent, routine communications updates. The Company’s Board met regularly and virtually, throughout 2021, and received updates on the Company’s actions related to COVID-19, the Company’s safety 
Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2021 Form 10-K Page 12


protocols, and ongoing monitoring, including updates on the Company’s COVID-19 Human Resources Taskforce’s priorities and current employee health statistics, and the Company’s risk posture. 
Workplace Safety
We believe that there is nothing more important than the safety of our team, our customers and our communities. We are committed to ensuring safety is at the center of our culture and the way we do business. The importance of safety is exhibited throughout the entire organization, with the direction and tone set by both our Board and our President and CEO, and including required attendance at monthly safety meetings, routine safety training and the inclusion of safety moments at key team meetings. 
To maintain safety as a priority, our employees remain committed and work together to ensure that our plans, programs, policies and behaviors are aligned with our aspirations as a Company. The achievement of superior safety performance is both an important short-term and long-term strategic initiative in managing our operations. In November 2020, we announced the completion of our state-of-the art training facility in Dover, Delaware. ‘Safety Town’ now serves as a resource for training our employees who build, maintain and operate our natural gas infrastructure, offering hands-on training and fully immersive, on-the-job field experiences. First responders and other community partners also benefit from the simulated environment and conditions they could encounter as they enter homes in the community. We are excited to start construction of a second ‘Safety Town’ facility in Florida in 2022. 
Environmental, Social and Governance Stewardship ("ESG") 
Consistent with our culture of teamwork, the broad responsibility of ESG stewardship is supported across our organization by the dedication and efforts of our Board of Directors and its Committees, as well as the entrepreneurship and dedication of our team. As stewards of long-term enterprise value, the Board of Directors is committed to overseeing the sustainability of the Company and its safety and operational compliance practices, and to promoting equity, diversity and inclusion that reflects the diverse communities we serve. The Corporate Governance Committee oversees our ESG activities and initiatives to continue enhancing our culture of sustainability and corporate governance practices. The Audit Committee oversees the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process, our risk exposure, and implementation and effectiveness of our risk management programs. The Compensation Committee promotes a culture of equity, diversity and inclusion and contributes to the ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate both at the executive level and throughout the organization. Finally, the Investment Committee assists the Board of Directors with evaluating investments pursuant to or in support of our growth strategy, both organically and through acquisitions, including renewable natural gas and other sustainable initiatives.
