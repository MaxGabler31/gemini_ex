Mission Statement
Our mission is to deliver high-speed solutions to break bandwidth barriers on every wired connection in the data infrastructure market.
Company Overview
Credo is an innovator in providing secure, high-speed connectivity solutions that deliver improved power and cost efficiency as data generation and corresponding bandwidth requirements increase exponentially throughout the data infrastructure market.
Our innovations ease system bandwidth bottlenecks while simultaneously improving on power, security and reliability. Our connectivity solutions are optimized for optical and electrical Ethernet applications, including the emerging 100G (or Gigabits per second), 200G, 400G and 800G markets. Our products are based on our Serializer/Deserializer (SerDes) and Digital Signal Processor (DSP) technologies. Our product families include integrated circuits (ICs), Active Electrical Cables (AECs) and SerDes Chiplets. Our IP solutions consist primarily of SerDes IP licensing. 
Data generation has increased dramatically over the past ten years, creating new and complicated challenges in both circuit and system design. Our proprietary SerDes and DSP technologies enable us to disrupt competition in existing markets, lead the way into emerging markets and innovate to create new market opportunities. While many others in the data infrastructure industry struggle to meet customers’ increasing performance and energy efficiency requirements, we continue to innovate to deliver groundbreaking solutions. A recent example is the announcement of our HiWire Switch AEC and open-source implementation with Microsoft that helps realize Microsoft’s vision for a highly reliable network-managed dual-Top-of-Rack (ToR) architecture (a network architecture design in which computing equipment located within the same or an adjacent rack are, for redundancy, connected to two in-rack network switches, which are, in turn, connected to aggregation switches via fiber optic cables), overcoming complex and slow legacy enterprise approaches, simplifying deployment and improving connection reliability in the datacenter.
The multibillion dollar data infrastructure market that we serve is driven largely by hyperscale data centers (hyperscalers), high performance computing (HPC) and 5G infrastructure. The demands for increased bandwidth, improved power and cost efficiency and heightened security have simultaneously and dramatically expanded as work, education and entertainment have rapidly digitized across myriad endpoint users. 
Within the data infrastructure ecosystem, we target the wired connectivity market as it relates to communication electronics, which Gartner forecasts will grow from $12 billion in 2020 to $17 billion in 2025.1 650 Group forecasts that within this market, hyperscalers will be one of the primary drivers of growth for connectivity solutions and that higher speed 400G and 800G ports in the datacenter in particular will grow at a 49% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2020 to 2025. Additionally, we estimate that the market for high-speed connectivity products will grow from $2 billion in 2022 to $5 billion in 2025. Our core technology is standard-agnostic, and any high-speed connectivity environment, such as the enterprise, HPC or consumer environment, could be a target for our disruptive solutions. We believe our market opportunity will continue to grow as the technical challenges of delivering higher speeds create increasingly challenging technical or cost hurdles for incumbent providers.
We design, market and sell both product and IP solutions. We help define industry conventions and standards within the markets we target by collaborating with technology leaders and standards bodies.

We contract with a variety of manufacturing partners to build our products based on our proprietary SerDes and DSP technologies. We develop standard solutions we can sell broadly to our end markets and also develop tailored solutions designed to address specific customer needs. Once developed, these tailored solutions can generally be broadly leveraged across our portfolio and we are able to sell the part or license the IP into the broader market. 
We have global sales, marketing and business development teams responsible for identifying and building our customer relationships. We sell our products to hyperscalers and cloud infrastructure providers, as well as 5G wireless, enterprise networking and HPC customers. We are engaged with five of the top seven hyperscalers (measured by their total capital expenditures across all vendors for the twelve months ended April 30, 2022), and our customer base includes over 20 blue chip clients, including more than 10 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs), over 10 optical module manufacturers, and other leading enterprises.
During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we generated $106.5 million and $58.7 million in total revenue, respectively. Product sales and product engineering services revenue comprised 77% and 63% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, and IP license and IP license engineering services revenue represented 23% and 37% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Geographically, 36% and 75% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, was generated from customers in North America, and 64% and 25% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, was generated from customers in the rest of the world, primarily in Asia. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we generated $22.2 million and $27.5 million in net loss, respectively.
Industry Overview
We believe we are well positioned to benefit from the strong secular tailwinds driving the data infrastructure market, which is being driven by several factors, including:
Explosion of Data Generation and Network Traffic: Cloud workloads, already vast and expanding, the proliferation of streaming video, 5G wireless deployment, expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and growing adoption of artificial intelligence are creating an explosion of data, which is straining existing data infrastructure and forcing paradigm shifts from transistor to system level. According to International Data Corporation, the amount of data created, captured, copied and consumed in the world is expected to increase by approximately 2.8 times, from 64 Zettabytes (ZB)2 in 2020 to more than 179ZB in 2025, reflecting a projected CAGR of 23%. This rapid growth in data and the related data traffic across networks is leading to bandwidth barriers and bottlenecks, creating the need for solutions that can enable faster connectivity speeds while addressing power constraints and security requirements. 
Demand from All Corners of Digital Infrastructure: Increased data traffic requires increased data bandwidth. Participants across the data infrastructure ecosystem require higher performance connectivity solutions. We see this demand led by hyperscalers, whose position at the nexus of data infrastructure aggregates the incremental increases at the network edge, quickly followed by demand from 5G carriers. Furthermore, as the industry develops and bandwidth requirements proliferate, we expect to see these same dynamics extend more broadly, driving increased adoption in enterprise, HPC and consumer applications.
Hyperscalers, which are companies with the ability to seamlessly provision and add compute, memory, networking, and storage resources to a given node or set of nodes that make up a larger computing, distributed computing or grid computing environment, are one of the primary drivers of demand for high-speed, low-power connectivity solutions. By 2025, 650 Group forecasts that hyperscalers will purchase 39% of the Ethernet switches sold to the data center market, up from approximately 25% today. We expect hyperscalers to increase their bandwidth requirements as technological advances enable single-lane data rates to accelerate from 25G to 50G to 100G and beyond, powering link speeds of 100G, 200G/400G and 800G+. 650 Group estimates that total Ethernet 
2 One Zettabyte is equal to one trillion Gigabytes.
ports in the datacenter will grow at a 6% CAGR from 2020 to 2025 with higher speed switches capturing a greater share of overall ports. 650 Group further estimates that 400G and 800G switches together are expected to grow at a 49% CAGR over the same period.
The following chart from the industry research group LightCounting illustrates the projected Ethernet IC chipset shipments by speed, illustrating the evolution of data transmission rates and the resulting bandwidth. According to LightCounting, shipments of 50G or slower Ethernet IC chipsets is expected to decline from 36.2 million shipments in 2020 to 23.9 million shipments in 2025, a CAGR of (8%), while shipments of 100G Ethernet IC chipsets is expected to grow from 11.5 million shipments in 2020 to 25.6 million shipments in 2025, a CAGR of 17%. Projected growth for the fastest chips is even higher. 
LightCounting projects that shipments of 200G or faster Ethernet IC chipsets will grow from 1.1 million in 2020 to 20.2 million in 2025, a CAGR of 78%. 
As data transfer speeds increase, there are other implications for hyperscaler infrastructure. To achieve the benefits of higher bandwidth, every link in the hyperscaler data infrastructure must be accelerated, from the electrical connections on the switch ICs and packages, to the electrical connections on the switch and server printed circuit boards (PCBs) and ultimately to the electrical and optical connections in the cables and transceivers. In addition, given limited power budgets, there is a strong need for better power efficiency per bit transferred.
Similarly, with the global deployment of 5G networks, wireless carriers are also increasingly seeking higher performance connectivity solutions. According to Qualcomm, 5G is designed to support a 100x increase in traffic capacity and network efficiency. 5G basebands require ICs that support higher volumes of data traffic as compared to previous generations, causing 5G carriers to demand high-speed connectivity. The deployment of 5G networks will immediately require 50G ports for the infrastructure. We expect to address such demand with our 50G per lane and 100G per lane solutions. Coupled with the growth in data traffic and the desire to minimize latency and maximize uptime, we expect that 5G expansion will drive increased demand for faster connectivity. 
Beyond hyperscalers and 5G networking, the evolution of connectivity standards for servers such as Peripheral Component Interconnect Express and consumer devices such as Universal Serial Bus (USB) present an additional long-term opportunity. As these connectivity standards move to higher-speed data rates and higher order modulation, innovation in power efficiency and cost efficiency will be required to deliver competitive connectivity solutions. We expect that demand for increasingly sophisticated connectivity solutions will grow alongside the evolution of these standards. We estimate that the combined PCIe and USB markets will increase from $1 billion in 2022 to almost $3 billion in 2025.
Increasing Shift to DDC: Hyperscalers and 5G network operators are rapidly evolving their network topology architectures as they move towards higher speeds. Increasingly, these customers are looking to Distributed, Disaggregated Chassis (DDCs), which separate the traditional, proprietary chassis used for 
switching and routing into its building blocks so it can more efficiently scale. The move to DDCs enables the use of standards-based hardware, a choice in software and the ability to avoid vendor lock-in. However, legacy connectivity options are poorly suited to address this evolution. Optical transceivers and Active Optical Cables (AOCs) suffer from high power consumption, high costs and poor longevity, and passive DACs are too thick and short-reaching to route at the required densities. This is leading to increasing interest in AEC technology as a key enabling technology for DDC architectures, as AECs reduce DDC power consumption, improve reliability and enable density levels not achievable with legacy solution.
Historically, the connection between server Network Interface Cards (NICs) and ToR ports has been dominated by passive Direct Attach Cables (DAC) technology. For example, according to estimates by 650 Group, 94% of ToR Ports in U.S. and China-based hyperscalers were connected to NICs by DACs in 2020. However, hyperscalers are increasingly looking to active cables, such as AECs, because, at higher data rates, DACs cannot attain the reach necessary for certain datacenter layouts. But AECs also augment ToR and NIC functions by integrating additional system-level features into the cables. Unlike DACs, they are active components in the network, but unlike most other components of the network they can be integrated at any time, without significant downtime. This enables, for example, upgrades to dual-ToR redundancy, or extended life for older servers through in-cable speed shifting. 650 Group believes that active cables for U.S. and Chinese hyperscalers will grow from 3% of NIC-ToR connections in 2021 to 49% of NIC-ToR by 2025, as illustrated in the table below.
Our Market Opportunity
We believe we are in the early stages of penetrating a massive opportunity. We benefit from the strong secular tailwinds in the data infrastructure market. Within the large and growing data infrastructure ecosystem, our offerings target the wired connectivity market as it relates to communication electronics. According to Gartner, the wired connectivity market for communication electronics is expected to grow from $12 billion in 2020 to $17 billion in 2025.3 650 Group forecasts that within this market, hyperscalers will be one of the primary drivers of growth for connectivity solutions and that higher speed 400G and 800G switches in the datacenter in particular will grow at a 49% CAGR from 2020 to 2025. Additionally, we estimate that the market for high-speed connectivity products will grow from $2 billion in 2022 to $5 billion in 2025.

Our Products and Solutions
We are pioneering comprehensive Ethernet connectivity solutions that deliver high bandwidth, scalability and end-to-end signal integrity for next-generation platforms. Today, we offer the following products and solutions: HiWire AECs, Optical PAM4 DSPs, Line Card PHYs, SerDes Chiplets and SerDes IP.
HiWire AECs: HiWire AECs are copper interconnect cables designed for affordable, low-power operation at 100G, 200G, 400G, and 800G data speeds. HiWire AECs enable hyperscalers and 5G architects to accelerate the transition to DDC by offering a high-performance alternative to short, thick DACs and high-power, high-cost AOCs. DDCs allow providers to pair hardware from ODMs with open source and third-party software to address issues surrounding operating expenses, flexibility and cost in traditional chassis applications. Our ToR to NIC AEC solutions enable hardware architects to pair commodity NIC and ToR hardware with value-added AECs to address needs related to redundancy and racking plans. Our HiWire AEC solutions include SWITCH, SPAN, SHIFT and CLOS AECs: 
•Credo HiWire SWITCH AEC enables a NIC to connect to two ToRs in an Active/Standby configuration for sub-millisecond failover that is fully network operating system managed. This 
enables the simplicity of a single NIC-ToR connector for the server and user with reliability and convergence times that are superior to legacy link aggregation structures.
•Credo HiWire SPAN AECs are a plug and play replacement of AOC for high-speed interconnects. Intended for rack-to-rack connectivity, these cables support up to 7-meter reach, consume up to 50% less power than AOCs, cost up to 50% less than AOCs and offer a 10-year service life.
•Credo’s HiWire SHIFT AECs are a lower power, lower cost replacement to optical transceivers for high-speed interconnects that provides connectivity between PAM4 (a modulation scheme that doubles a network’s data rate by combining two bits into a single symbol with four amplitude levels) and non-return-to-zero (NRZ) ports with speed shifting and forward error correction (FEC) termination in-cable.
•Credo HiWire CLOS AECs are specifically designed for high density in-rack or HPC rack-to-rack interconnect to support CLOS architectures, a type of non-blocking, multistage switching architecture that reduces the number of ports required in an interconnected fabric. With up to 50% less power than optical solutions and up to 75% less volume than DACs, these AECs enable CLOS cabling densities up to 1,000 cables per rack. 
Optical DSPs: We provide high-performance, low-power and cost-effective 50G to 400G PAM4 optical DSPs across a broad spectrum of use cases, speeds and bandwidths. The DSPs enable optical interconnect for cloud-scale, hyperscale and enterprise data center build-outs with 100G to 800G PAM4 optical modules and build-outs for 5G wireless service providers with 50G optical modules. These full-featured DSPs utilize our industry-leading transmitters and low bit error rate (BER) receivers, and are optimized for cost-effective production. 
Our extensive optical product portfolio comprising our Dove and Seagull product families includes PAM4 DSPs for 50G, 100G, 200G, 400G and 800G PAM4 optical interconnects. Our proprietary DSP technology and equalization techniques help compensate for optical impairments to achieve optimal overall system performance, signal integrity and power efficiency. We introduced 50G PAM4 DSPs to operate over the full industrial temperature range of -40°C to +85°C module case and that are ideal for use in 5G wireless / enhanced Common Public Radio Interface front-, mid- and back-haul applications. The integrated DSP technology is critical in 5G wireless applications where cost-effective solutions are required, enabling wider use of Directly Modulated Lasers and un-cooled optics.
Line Card PHYs: We are enabling data connectivity and security in hyperscale and enterprise data centers with leading edge, low-power line card PHY solutions. Our Retimers, Gearboxes and MACsec / IPSEC devices support PAM4 / NRZ backplane and line card connectivity up to 112G per lane, supporting platforms up to 25.6 Terabits per second (Tbps) with 800G ports. Dedicated and multi-mode Retimers, Gearboxes and MACsecs, built around our low-power, high-performance SerDes IP, enable our customers to meet performance, power and price objectives.
Our Line Card PHY product families include our Black Hawk and Bald Eagle products for Retimers and Gearboxes, as well as our Owl series for MACsec / IPSEC applications.
SerDes Chiplets: SerDes technology enables data transmission at high rates while minimizing the number of interconnects required. As the bandwidth of interconnects increase, the complexity of the design for signal transmission increases. Our SerDes architecture has made it possible to deliver cost- and power-effective SerDes solutions in mature process nodes and make them available in chiplet form (multiple SerDes lanes in a single die) for integration with MCM System-on-Chips (SoCs), overcoming the need for matching core logic and SerDes IP in the same process node. Our SerDes Chiplets are designed for high performance and low power from mature processes, allowing customers to fabricate their core logic in advanced processes and combine them in their MCM SoC.
SerDes IP: SerDes IP is designed for the easy SoC integration of tens to hundreds of SerDes lanes. We designed our SerDes IP to optimally balance performance, power and manufacturing process costs and risks. Our patented mixed signal and DSP architectures are the foundation of our high-performance 
and low-power SerDes technology. Our architectural approach enables design in a mature fabrication process while delivering leading-edge performance and power efficiency, which has led to our more than 30 IP licensing engagements. Nevertheless, as part of our commitment to long-term innovation, we continuously develop technology in cutting-edge fabrication processes such as 5nm in order to enhance our competitive position, and to serve the market of IP licensing customers whose logic requires cutting-edge fabrication processes. 
Our Customers
We sell our products to hyperscalers, OEMs, ODMs and optical module manufacturers, as well as into the enterprise and HPC markets. We work closely and have engagements with industry-leading companies across these segments. 
We currently rely and expect to continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant part of our revenue. In fiscal 2022, we had four customers that each accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue. Each of the four customers accounted for 30%, 18%, 11% and 10%, respectively, of our fiscal 2022 revenue. In fiscal 2022, 36% of our revenue was derived from customers based in North America, and 64% was derived from customers based in Asia and other regions. The percentages in the preceding sentence are calculated based on destination of shipment and location of contracting entity, which may differ from the end customer’s principal offices.
Sales and Marketing
We employ a two-pronged sales strategy targeting both the end users of our products, as well as the suppliers of our end users. By engaging directly with the end user, we are able to better understand the needs of our customers and cater our solutions to their most pressing connectivity requirements.
This strategy has enabled us to become the preferred vendor to a number of our customers across the world who, in turn, require their suppliers, OEMs, ODMs and optical module manufacturers, to utilize our solutions. For example, five optical suppliers are currently designing products with our 200G Optical DSPs, and multiple optical suppliers are designing products with us for unrelated platforms due to performance, power and price advantages.
We sell our solutions worldwide through our direct sales force. We have a sales presence in North America, Asia and Europe. Our direct sales force is supported by marketing, business development and Field Application Engineer teams across our regions. These teams are organized to align with our product verticals. 
Manufacturing & Suppliers
We utilize a fabless business model, working with a network of third parties to manufacture, assemble, and test our connectivity products. This approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our core competencies and to control and reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures. 
We subject our third-party manufacturing contractors to qualification requirements to meet the high quality and reliability standards required of our products. We qualify our contractors and their processes before applying technology to our products. Our engineers work closely with our third-party foundry vendor and other contractors to increase yield, lower manufacturing costs and improve product quality.
•Wafer Fabrication: We currently utilize a wide range of semiconductor process generations to develop and manufacture our products. For all of our products, we use TSMC for semiconductor wafer production.
•Package, Assembly and Testing: Upon the completion of processing at the foundry, we use third-party contractors for packaging, assembly and testing, including Amkor and ASE for 
packaging our IC products, KYEC and TeraPower for testing our IC products and BizLink and Foxlink for manufacturing our AEC products.
Research and Development
We view our technology as a competitive advantage and devote substantial resources to the research and development of new products and the improvement of existing products. We have committed, and plan to continue to commit significant resources to technology and product innovation and development. We have assembled a team of highly skilled engineers with deep signal processing expertise who are located in San Jose, California, mainland China and Taiwan. As of April 30, 2022, we employed 310 engineers. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2022 and 2021 were $47.9 million and $34.8 million, respectively.
Intellectual Property (“IP”)
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our brand and technology, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties and prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, and contractual protections, to protect our core technology.
As of April 30, 2022, we owned 51 issued patents and 24 pending patent applications in the United States, and 17 issued patents and 37 pending patent applications in mainland China. Our patent and patent application portfolio primarily relates to four main areas: Ethernet standard, network cable technology, chip manufacturing and MCM and SerDes cores. These issued patents, and any patents granted from such applications, are expected to expire between 2029 and 2042, without taking potential patent term extensions or adjustments into account. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent. It may also be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications that we have filed or may file in the future will result in issued patents, and we can give no assurance that any patents that have issued or might issue in the future will protect our current or future products, will provide us with any competitive advantage, and will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.
Moreover, we rely, in part, on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. While we take steps to protect and preserve our trade secrets, including by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors and by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
Competition
We believe we are the only company in our industry offering a complete suite of high-performance connectivity solutions. Our competitors typically compete with us with respect to some, but not all, of our solutions. Our principal competitors with respect to our products include Broadcom and Marvell, as well 
as various DAC suppliers. Our principal competitors with respect to IP licensing include Synopsys, Cadence and Alphawave. The principal competitive factors in our market include:
•success in identifying new and emerging markets, applications and technologies;
•product performance, power efficiency and cost-effectiveness;
•ability to provide a broad range of connectivity products and solutions;
•ability to deliver products in large volume on a timely basis at a competitive price;
•ability to offer products and features previously not available in the marketplace; and
•extent of IP protection and enforcement of rights.
We believe competition will increase as our market grows and connectivity technology advances. New entrants could enter our market, creating additional competition in the future. Although we believe we compete favorably with respect to the above factors, our future competitiveness will depend upon our ability to continue to design, develop and market compelling solutions.

Our company-wide compensation structure is intended to align incentives with the success of Credo. This includes our executives, whose incentives are generally the same as the rest of our employees. We believe that this fosters harmony within the company, as all teams are working together towards the same goals.
Our ongoing focus on workplace safety and compliance to applicable regulations has enabled us to preserve business continuity while ensuring a safe work environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
including work-from-home arrangements for a substantial portion of our workforce and reduced capacity for those that have returned to the office, adhering to local health authority guidelines. We also comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding workplace safety and are subject to audits by entities such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the United States. We rely on third parties to manufacture our products and require our suppliers to maintain a safe work environment, as described in further detail under “—Manufacturing & Suppliers.”
Facilities
We lease 87,608 square feet of office space in San Jose, California under a lease expiring on October 31, 2030. We also lease approximately 56,348 square feet of office space in Shanghai, mainland China under leases expiring November 30, 2024 (with an option to extend), and approximately 18,537 square feet of office space in Zhubei City, Taiwan, under a lease expiring June 30, 2023. We lease additional small spaces in mainland China and the United States to support local staff. 
We believe that our existing facilities are sufficient for our current needs. We intend to add new facilities and expand our existing facilities as we continue to add employees and grow our business. We believe that new spaces will be available at reasonable terms in the future in order to meet our needs.

Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business.

The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
