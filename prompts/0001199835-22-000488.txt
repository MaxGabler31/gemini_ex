Item 1. Description of Business
Overview
 
Treasure Shipwreck & Recovery, Inc. (TSR, us, we,, the Company) is focused, through its wholly owned subsidiary TSR Holdings, Inc., on the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks. The Company has acquired various assets including a research vessel and specialized sensing equipment to be utilized to attempt to locate and eventually recover artifacts and treasure from historic shipwrecks, generally from the colonial era. The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary TSR Media Group, Inc., seeks to develop media and gaming based revenue streams based on the treasure salvage operations.
Corporate History
 
TSR was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 24, 2016. The Company was originally incorporated as Beliss Corp. On June 26, 2019, the Company changed its name to Treasure & Shipwreck Recovery, Inc. The Company was originally in the search engine optimization (SEO), Internet marketing and web development business. Although TSR does not believe that it will generate any significant new business for its Internet marketing and website development services, the Company is prepared to fulfill any obligations related to customer deposits that were received in prior years. 
Exploration and Salvage of Historic Shipwrecks
 
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has estimated that there are as many as three million shipwrecks on the floors of the worlds oceans. Although it is a fact that many of these shipwrecks were not carrying any items of significant value, historic research documentation shows that it is likely that a percentage of these shipwrecks contained valuable artifacts and treasure, such as gold and silver coins, other precious metals and gems, such as emeralds.
 
While the 2021 Summer Season was successful, and numerous objects were recovered, including numerous coins, capsules called onion jars, ships parts, and many objects were recovered, they were taken into possession by the main contractors, we are awaiting disposition of the contents with the State of Florida and Federal Court through the main place holder of rights. TSR expects that distribution to occur in the short term, when TSR will gain its part of the recoveries for sale and keeping as assets which we expect to be appreciable for sale, NFT and other sales on a set up area for sales through our Media Group, and partner on line brokers.

For the 2022 Summer Season TSR has again contracted with entities for recoveries on 1715 fleet and other or ancient wreck sites along the coast of Florida. Thus far this has been a successful season that will be more updated in the next quarter. As well as news being released on our social media Facebook page and other arenas. TSR is educating the public and some 24,000 followers on ancient shipwrecks and recoveries from around the world, and from shipwrecks off of Florida.
 
TSR, through its wholly owned subsidiary TSR Media Group, Inc. is actively pursuing the media coverage opportunities and expanding its social media presence across the globe with an agreement with a public relations firm that will have the Facebook page, Twitter account, TikTok account, and numerous other sites that will be interactive for the anticipated millions of followers that we will seek to gain to follow the story of TSR as it goes forward. During this same time, TSR has acquired media equipment such as drones and underwater cameras for use in documenting the Companys operations. TSR has teamed with a renowned Media Group to maintain the TSR Facebook and Instagram accounts, as well as setting up sales and auction sites for sales of items recovered or otherwise under control for public sale worldwide.
 
The treasure related search and recovery business is highly specialized and requires special research and recovery capabilities. The industry and opportunity may have significant potential. For three hundred years, Spain and other European colonial powers pillaged the new world of treasure, shipping riches in thousands of ships over time back to Europe for the enjoyment and funding of those who never earned it. Along the way, an estimated one out of ten never made it home. Estimates of lost treasure from these ships in the Caribbean and the coast of Florida alone is conservatively placed at $60 billion.
 
Locating, exploring and salvaging historic shipwrecks involves a very lengthy and expensive process. It may take several years to successfully locate and salvage treasure or other valuable artifacts from viable shipwrecks. Moreover, the costs to operate in the historic shipwreck salvage industry can be excessive. These costs and expenses may exceed the economic value of any treasure that is successfully located.
 
Even if TSR is able to successfully locate historic shipwrecks, there are additional challenges to successfully recovering treasure. There are also various laws and regulations, both internationally and domestically, that must be complied with. These laws and regulations could further hamper or delay the Company in successfully locating and recovering treasure. There have been legal cases where shipwrecks were located and valuable treasure was successfully salvaged by one group only to have government or other private entities assert rights to the treasure. Such a situation could cause extensive delays in monetizing the treasure due to legal proceedings. There may also be environmental related laws and regulations for the areas where we conduct shipwreck salvage operations. However, in order to alleviate many of these concerns we are now operating in subcontractor situations where these permits and grants are in place and TSR is avoiding situations where governments would deny permitting and actions due to our responsible conduct with our partners on these locations. So therefore, we are not suffering from delays and oversights of other governmental agencies that are occurring with other treasure related commercial salvage businesses.
 
Furthermore, working in an underwater environment can be hazardous. Difficult weather conditions can significantly delay operations. The condition of wrecks and other natural hazards can impede salvage efforts for long periods of time, potentially many years in some cases. The maintenance and repair issues with salvage vessels and equipment can be continuous and very expensive which may lead to excessive down time. 
 
Even if the Company is able to locate viable shipwrecks that theoretically may contain valuable treasure, there is the possibility that they may have already been stripped of anything of value. They may also not have been carrying anything valuable on board at the time that they were lost at sea. It is the Companys intent to find shipwrecks where available research suggests there were not any previous recovery efforts or past recovery efforts failed or were not completed. In the event that valuable artifacts are located and recovered, it is possible that the cost of recovery will exceed the value of the artifacts recovered. It is also possible that other entities, including both private parties and governmental entities, will assert conflicting claims and challenge the Companys rights to the recovered artifacts.
 
Salvage of historic shipwrecks is both very speculative and risky. Only those investors who do not require liquidity and who can afford the loss of their entire investment should consider an investment into TSRs securities. Investors should also seek advice from a professional financial adviser before purchasing the securities of TSR. The Company was able to secure the immediate bridge financing that was necessary for the complete build out of our vessels, the purchase of state of the art dive equipment, multiple GPS systems that are super accurate, sonar systems as well as detection devices and the maintenance of capable treasure salvage vessels being used to obtain our goals off the East Coast of Florida primarily in the Sebastian area.

Treasure Search and Salvage Gaming App
 
The Company hired an app developer to create a gaming app based on treasure search and salvage. TSR believes that there potentially will be significant consumer interest in a downloadable gaming app based on the search for treasure from historic shipwrecks. TSR is currently working with its core in house development side to have a totally on line gaming experience that can be published worldwide. While TSR canceled its previous agreement with a developer that had been contracted, the Company now has the game being explored through TSR Media Group, Inc. to be developed.
Revenue Sources
 
TSR believes that it has numerous potential revenue routes. Assuming that the Company is able to successfully locate and recover treasure from a historic shipwreck, one revenue opportunity is to keep many artifacts and treasure as assets, to be shown in a planned TSR museum or public display. Second is sale of treasure and artifacts through certain auction houses and arranged product sales for coins, etc. Third is private collector sales. Fourth is road show and museum show fees. Finally, holding rights to television and future gaming revenues from its treasure search and salvage gaming app. for use on phones and other devices. Although the Company is actively working to develop revenue streams from its core treasure recovery business and ancillary business opportunities, it is challenging to project when revenues will be realized, if ever. The Company does expect that sales of some ancient items in the forms of coins, gem stone pieces and shipwreck objects may anticipate generating any revenues for the foreseeable future from the treasure recovery business or associated businesses via website or other sales.
Competition
 
There are various entities who are working to salvage historic shipwrecks. There are a few small publicly traded companies and numerous private mostly mom and pop companies, as well as individuals, who could be considered competitors to locate and salvage treasure from historic shipwrecks. A few of these entities may have access to financing or greater resources than TSR. The Company is evaluating partnerships and joint ventures that it believes would be beneficial for financial or strategic reasons with other industry participants. TSR does not see these other ventures as competitive necessarily except for the fact that if large amounts of gold, silver and jewels are found it could have a liquidity effect on the market place for sale of such items. As well the media and gaming side of matters gives TSR a different business plan then others who are in the business. In fact, TSR looks to partner with certain other companies and technologies that are in the treasure business to use such technologies to define down the actual spots where gold, silver, jewelry and other items can be found using their breakthrough technologies.
Research and Development Activities and Costs
 
During the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, we incurred $8,000 and $20,000, respectively, of research and development costs related to the development of our treasure search and salvage gaming app.
COVID-19 Pandemic Threat and Continuity Plan
 
Due to current events involving the global COVID-19 pandemic, TSR, under the guidance of its President, is reviewing procedures to monitor current events as they relate to our business and to be prepared to respond to any potential threats or issues in order to protect the Company and its assets. We are also in the process of reviewing plans to locate a back office for our corporate records and information at a location to be designated so that in the event that access to the Companys offices are restricted, the Company is able to continue with its business and operations. 
 
The Companys operations may be adversely affected by the ongoing outbreak of the COVID-19 which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. The ultimate disruption which may be caused by the outbreak is uncertain; however, it may result in a material adverse impact on TSRs financial position, operations and cash flows.
 
Possible effects may include, but are not limited to, disruption to the Companys operations, inability of management team members and other key personnel and consultants to provide services in a timely manner, unavailability of equipment, parts and supplies used in operations, lack of access to maintenance and repair facilities for the Companys salvage vessel, and a decline in the value of the Companys assets including its salvage vessel, equipment and its digital properties.
 
Additionally, it is possible that the Company is not able to obtain financing due to COVID-19s effects on the general economy and the capital markets. If the Company is not able to obtain financing due to COVID-19 then it is highly likely that it will be forced to cease its operations. The impact of smaller companies such as TSR having to cease operations due to effects of COVID-19 would likely result in the Company not being able to survive and would cause a complete loss of all capital invested in the Company.
