Business Growth Strategy
 
Our mission is to provide excellence in multi-disciplinary primary healthcare assessment, diagnosis, treatment, pain management and prevention through the integration of technology and rehabilitative science. Key elements of our business growth strategy include:

1. | Increase Market Share in Canada. We intend to expand our market share in Canada through strategic acquisitions of additional multi-disciplinary primary healthcare providers and clinics in markets that we currently populate, as well as in new geographic markets. In addition, we expect to continue increasing our market share in existing eldercare services, occupational therapy services, physiotherapy services and speech language pathology services through network affiliation growth and new contract awards. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Launch our Exclusive Cannabidiol (“CBD”) Medical Cannabis Product Platform in Canada. Our platform is expected to include CBD manufacturing, sales and distribution. We expect that our CBD products will be specifically focused on CBD for use (i) as a treatment aid; (ii) to provide relief for a large array of neurological and musculoskeletal system disorders; and (iii) as an alternative option for healthcare providers in place of prescribing opioids to patients. Offering our patients access to non-hallucinogenic and non-addictive natural remedies, under required clinical oversight policies and procedures as they relate to medicinal cannabis and CBD, combined with our existing clinic-based treatment protocols allows us to enter this market segment with a unique integration model not readily available in the marketplace.

3. | Expand Operations into the United States. We plan to expand operations into the U.S. through: 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The introduction of a customized version of our multi-disciplinary primary healthcare service model, with emphasis on pain prevention, treatment and management, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The strategic acquisition of targeted U.S. operating clinics in key geographical areas, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establishment of strategic corporate alliances and partnerships with existing U.S. healthcare provider facilities, including certain of our current Canadian clients with U.S.-based facilities, allowing us immediate access to their client base; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Integration of specific specialized multi-disciplinary services and products that are a direct compliment to the existing healthcare related products and services already provided by brand-recognized, established retail entities such as grocers, pharmacies and clinics. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Introduction of “Micro-clinics” in Certain Underserved Population Centers. We plan to leverage our expertise in the interface of technology and patient engagement to introduce our multi-disciplinary primary healthcare services and products through “micro-clinics” located in certain underserved population centers. Rather than relying on the traditional centralized model of bringing people to healthcare, our “micro-clinic” model allows for people in urban, rural and remote population centers to have greater access and availability to a wide range of healthcare products and services. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. | Expand our Posture, Stride, and Kinetic Body Movement Scanning Technologies and Protocols. When combined with decades of data harvesting and analysis, we believe these specialized technologies and protocols provide our clinics with the ability to deliver better care, early diagnosis and preventative healthcare strategies. 
6. | Continue to Develop and Expand our Virtual Physician Access System. We expect to continue development and expansion of our virtual physician access system, sometimes referred to in the industry as “telemedicine” or “virtual medicine.” Our telemedicine system provides patients with real-time access to third-party primary care physicians and specialists in various medical disciplines. Telemedicine is transforming traditional approaches to healthcare by providing ease of access and reduced costs for patients, particularly in areas with limited access to primary care general practitioners and specialists. Our advanced telemedicine platform integrates certain medical devices, such as a blood pressure reading device, a derma scope and an ophthalmoscope otoscope, each of which can provide the doctor with real-time diagnostic data, greatly enhancing the doctor’s ability to provide the patient with an accurate diagnosis. Our telemedicine platform is designed to allow any healthcare clinic or location to install and utilize our telemedicine platform at a relatively low-cost point of entry. 
7. | Launch our occupational therapy Motor Vehicle Accident (“MVA”) service in Canada. Our MVA service is expected to provide certain occupational therapy, assessment, analysis, rehabilitation, mobility aids and counseling. 
8. | Launch our Independent Medical Evaluation Service in Canada. Our independent medical evaluation service will be available for corporate and insurance clients. 
9. | Launch our Rehabilitative Clinical Practice Management Support Program. This program is designed to assist purchasers of a proprietary revenue enhancement software franchise.

Eldercare Centric Homes
 
We provide rehabilitation, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and assistive devices to eldercare clients located at various long-term care homes, retirement homes and community clients across Ontario, Canada. We provide our eldercare clients an integrated approach to rehabilitative strategies and continued education for the clients, their caregivers and the clients’ family members through its two major multi-dimensional primary healthcare offerings: physiotherapy (“PT”) and occupational therapy (“OT”).
 
As a result of NHL’s asset acquisition of Peak Health LTC Inc., which was formed in 2006, we have a long history of providing PT services to the eldercare community. Because PT and OT have similar philosophies and there is an overlap and synchronicity between the two services, there was a natural progression of demand that led us to commence offering our eldercare OT services in 2017.
 
Additionally, our proprietary Electronic Rehabilitation Record and Management Reporting software solution provides us the ability to provide each eldercare facility client with PT and OT reports that identify cost and optimization possibilities, a wide variety of client outcome measurements, overall contract effectiveness and much more.
 
Our eldercare PT services are provided as follows:
 

1. | Long-Term Care Homes. NHL contracts with client homes to provide individualized onsite PT and group exercise classes to the residents living in the long-term care homes. Registered physiotherapists are assisted by on-site support personnel to deliver individualized care based on assessed needs. These services are primarily funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (“MOHLTC”). The NHL team assists in providing assistive device assessments, enabling residents access to varying mobility aides. In addition to providing PT services, our team assists the long-term care home’s interdisciplinary team in annual care conferences for residents in the home, education regarding nursing restorative programming, back education, falls prevention and many other subjects related to PT or physical health and wellness. The NHL team works together with the interdisciplinary team to assist with mandatory coding of Canada’s Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set (“RAI-MDS”), which is the standardized assessment tool required for the home to access payment from the MOHLTC for each resident. Additionally, through NHL’s proprietary software, the homes have access to abundant reporting solutions to help provide objective and quantitative measures for their continuous quality improvement program. Additionally, we have been able to offer licensing rights for our proprietary software to client homes which desire to self-manage the in-facility therapy services provided to its residents. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Retirement Homes. We contract with client homes to provide individualized PT and group exercise classes to the retirement homes’ residents. Registered physiotherapists are assisted by the onsite support personnel to deliver individualized care based on assessed needs. These services are partly privately funded and partly funded by the MOHLTC. Similar to the long-term care sector, our team assists with education of the nursing/interdisciplinary team and provides in depth service reports to the homes to measure desired service delivery. In addition to the services above, some of the residents in the retirement homes (or their family members) desire to have an increased level of service and opt to pay for additional private services. This is available on a fee-for-service basis and is most often in the form of individualized PT. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Community Care Access Centres and Home Care. The MOHLTC operates community care access centres to serve as contact points, information clearinghouses, assessment services, referral resources, and care coordinators for eligible residents who need healthcare assistance at home, or a safer place to live. The community care access centres are managed by the local health integration networks (“LHINs”), which are health authorities responsible for regional administration of public healthcare services in the province of Ontario, Canada. There are 14 LHINs in Ontario. Third parties known as “cluster providers” have service contracts with the community care access centre or LHIN, funded by the MOHLTC, to provide multi-disciplinary services to clients living in the community, clients living at-home or clients in a retirement home. We act as a subcontractor with the cluster provider to provide services for the North East LHIN, which is one of the largest of 14 LHINs in Ontario, responsible for planning, integrating and funding health care services for more than 565,000 people across 400,000 square kilometres and five sub-regions. Through this subcontract arrangement, we provide in-home one-on-one PT assessment and treatment, as well as group exercise classes to these clients who cannot access outpatient services due to mobility challenges. Primarily, these clients are elderly, although some are post-operative with mobility challenges. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. | Exercise & Falls Prevention. We also contract with two companies who are directly contracted by the MOHLTC to provide exercise and falls prevention classes in the community at large. We offer these classes in three LHINs (Central, Toronto Central and Central East), with an estimated aggregate population of 4.4 million people. A new community group exercise class initiative, released in 2013 and funded by the MOHLTC, is delivered by exercise instructors over a 48-week period each year. The goal of these classes is to assist seniors in maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle while still living at home. In addition, another component of the 2013 MOHLTC initiative is the delivery of fall prevention classes taught by specialized registered providers, such as kinesiologists and physiotherapists, with the assistance of exercise instructors. The goal of these classes is to assess seniors’ general health status, identify defined levels of risk pertaining to balance and falling, and educate seniors about fall prevention through a combination of increased knowledge and teaching exercises designed to improve strength and balance. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Community-based Outpatient Clinics. In addition, we provide outpatient PT services through two community-based clinics, one of which has been in operation for years. The other clinic is a new start-up in Northwestern Ontario and is affiliated with a local hospital/health network. One of the clinics also provides chiropractic and laser technology services. A portion of the services provided at both clinics is funded by the MOHLTC. The remainder of our services provided at these clinics is funded by MVA treatment plans, extended health benefits insurance coverage, or private payment. These services are specifically targeted to be delivered to clients who meet the following criteria: 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Aged 65 years of age and older or aged 18 years of age and younger, and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Are post-operative, or 
● | Have just been discharged from a hospital, or 
● | Are receiving services from the Ontario Disability Services Program or Ontario Works. 

 
Our eldercare OT services are provided, through 2 separate sectors, as follows:
 

1. | Long-Term Care Sector. We contract with client homes to provide the following OT services: 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Assessments and interventions to support maintenance and restoration of function related to seating, mobility, positioning for self-care, prevention of pressure ulcers, falls and use of restraints, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Speech language and pathology services, including evaluation and treatment, 
● | Swallowing and eating assessments and interventions, 
● | Cognitive behavioral assessments and care planning, 
● | Our occupational therapists have specialized training in mobility providing assistive device assessments when required. This service is funded primarily by the MOHLTC. 


2. | Retirement Home & Community. We provide the following OT services through individual contracts with private payers: 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Home safety assessments, 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Functional assessments, 
● | In-home activities of daily living assessments, 
● | Assessment and completion of applications for assistive devices (mobility aids), 
● | Custom seating and mobility consultations, 
● | Case management services, and 
● | Speech language and pathology services, including evaluation and treatment. 

About Our Affiliate Clinics
 
In order to strengthen our position within the Canadian Preferred Provider Network (“PPN”), we have built a contracted affiliate relationship with 88 clinics across Canada, including 76 clinics in Ontario province and 12 clinics located throughout Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Alberta. The PPN is a network of three major insurance companies and their subsidiaries, totaling 16 insurance companies. PPN member insurance companies in need of specific primary healthcare solutions for their patients send referrals to specific clinics registered through the PPN. We, as one of five major providers to the PPN, receive referrals through the PPN. This subset of business is a continuous source of referrals, from the insurance company payer to the approved group of clinics meeting the insurance companies’ pre-determined set of criteria for what they believe to be an appropriate clinical setting. Affiliate clinics pay us a mix of a flat fee and a percentage-based fee upon receipt of a payment for a service referred through the PPN.

-


The services provided by our affiliate clinics are consistent with the multi-disciplinary primary healthcare services provided by our own corporate clinics. While each affiliate clinic may provide additional unique healthcare solutions, all affiliate clinics must meet specific criteria established under the PPN, creating a single standard of excellence across all clinics within our network.
 
Contracts
 
Certain contracts held with client homes and client companies follow standard formats and include generally accepted terms of reference. Specific clauses within the NHL contracts for services contain language are intended to (1) clarify which entity is the health information custodian of the medical files (usually held by the client home or company), (2) define release of liability, (3) ensure privacy and confidentiality of proprietary information or private health information, (4) define provisions of worker’s compensation clearance or benefits for employees and/or contractors, (5) detail provisions of value-added items, services or programs, (6) set out terms and conditions of the contract (often for a set number of years with an option to a renew), (7) provide for termination conditions, and (8) detail invoicing and billing procedures.
Competition
 
In Canada, the specialized multi-disciplinary primary healthcare service sector in which we operate is highly competitive. With a finite number of patients and corporate clients, companies providing multi-disciplinary primary healthcare services operate within an overlapping patient and client landscape.
 
Our business strategy includes pursuing selective acquisitions of additional multi-disciplinary primary healthcare providers and clinics in markets that we currently populate, as well as in new geographic markets. There is additional competition from non-traditional multi-disciplinary healthcare providers, such as holistic and Eastern medicine-based clinics. We believe that we can successfully compete based on our large service offerings, competitive pricing, solid reputation and our clinicians’ devotion to maintaining high quality care and patient satisfaction.
 
Additionally, our ability to effectively compete for patients is impacted by commercial and managed care payor programs that influence patient choice by offering health insurance plans that restrict patient choice of provider.
 
Employees
 
As of August 31, 2018, we employed 86 full-time employees. We believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees and have not experienced any labor disputes.
