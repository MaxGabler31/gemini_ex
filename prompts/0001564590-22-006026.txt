Our Market Opportunities 
 Technology revolution and environmental impact is driving a swift pace of change, resulting in ongoing societal transformation, complicated geopolitical dynamics, a shifting threat landscape and the globalization of commerce. To address this evolving landscape, our customers are actively seeking technology-enabled solutions at the speed of relevancy to upgrade and transform assets and operations. The below trends are key growth drivers in both our Federal Solutions and Critical Infrastructure segments.
 Defense Spending Remains a Priority of the national agenda due to the reemergence of long-term strategic peer competition, which has been cited in the National Defense Strategy as the primary concern for U.S. national prosperity and security. This reemergence has resulted in increased global disorder and a security environment, defined by rapid technological change, which may be more complex than ever before. We believe the U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence community will continue to invest in cyber, space, C5ISR, and missile defense. 
 Cybersecurity is Mission Critical to U.S. National Security and cybersecurity threats are increasing in volume and sophistication as global connectivity and the rise of social media have led to an explosion in the amount of available and exploitable data. The recent SolarWinds hacking incident is a noteworthy example, and attacks on our critical infrastructure continue to rise.  The Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates that threats from hacks, cyber criminals, foreign governments, malicious insiders and corporate espionage have a $600 billion annual global cost impact. The proliferation of mobile devices, smart devices and cloud computing has vastly increased the need for enterprise-wide risk-based cybersecurity programs and governments have become increasingly aware of the need for a proactive approach to the risk of cyber-attacks. We believe that this market will continue to grow in response to the shifting threat landscape and recent high-profile attacks, including SolarWinds. 
 Consistent Need for Actionable Intelligence to Support U.S. Priorities is driving a shifting threat landscape that necessitates a greater need for collaboration and cooperation between intelligence agencies. There is a new demand for joint all-domain command and control systems that are optimized to function cohesively across a spectrum of domains. This in turn drives a need for sophisticated data analytics to aggregate data into useful formats in real-time. To respond, we believe the United States intelligence community and Department of Defense will need continued focus on information sharing and collaboration for improved intelligence accuracy and timeliness encompassing multiple forms of intelligence collection. 
 Global Infrastructure Needs Significant Replacements and Technology-Driven Upgrades. Aging physical infrastructure is strained by the swift pace of technological change combined with heightened new expectations for sustainability and environmental impact.  Furthermore, modernized infrastructure is important to recover from unexpected disasters caused by climate change.  The United States infrastructure needs exceed $2 trillion according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, for roads, highways, bridges, water/wastewater and other infrastructure needs.  The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IJJA) has increased funding for roads and highways, bridges, rail and transit, and aviation.  Additionally, global infrastructure is aging and there is demand in other regions, including Canada, the Middle East and Europe.  Critical infrastructure, specifically transportation infrastructure that is essential to national economic and security concerns including airports, bridges, and rail and transit systems, is particularly vulnerable. We believe that a focus on safety, sustainability and environmental impacts will continue to drive replacement of aging infrastructure with newer, smarter and more sustainable infrastructure with an increased focus on connectivity. 
 Urbanization Creates Demand for Smart Cities with Connected Populations. Cities around the globe increasingly demand new more sustainable capabilities, such as sensor networks and communication strategies to connect streetlights, security cameras and emergency systems, to provide 
 7


important real-time information and better serve their citizens and reduce carbon emissions. Integrated corridor management solutions, intelligent transportation systems, advanced rail systems and updated telecommunication networks will keep cities around the world functioning as smart and sustainable cities and serve as engines for economic growth. 
 Transformation of Legacy Service Delivery Models through Technology and Digital Transformation. Historical capital project management is changing with the introduction of cloud-connected computer-aided design, automation, big data, machine learning and other technologies. The introduction of these new technologies allows industry participants to reimagine existing value chains, address integrated lifecycle objectives, assure human rights are observed in their supply chains, provide environmentally sensitive and sustainable solutions, boost productivity and streamline project management. Industry participants that have the capability to embrace these new technologies to enhance their capability and service offering to higher value solutions will be well positioned to assist governments and communities in their transformation. 
 Change equals opportunity, and Parsons is well-positioned to serve a large array of diverse global customers. Across a broad set of industries, we provide smart and agile solutions that create the future for our national security and critical infrastructure customers as they adapt to the rapid changes of a more interconnected and technology-driven world.

 We maintain a robust acquisition pipeline and are continually evaluating potential opportunities for disciplined growth by acquisition to further transform our business. 
 Our Strategy for Growth 
 Our growth strategy is to create the future of national security and critical infrastructure, while moving up the value chain as a solutions integrator and software provider.  The future is full of possibility, and the defense, intelligence, and critical infrastructure markets are where we can collectively shape what tomorrow will look like.  Our goal is to help create a safer, healthier, more sustainable, more connected and more secure world.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Top Positions in High-Growth, Sustainable Markets 
 We have a balanced portfolio between national security and critical infrastructure and diverse range of end markets.  We recognize the importance of driving business focus and will resource/invest in areas where we believe Parsons can have a top position in markets that are high-growth, profitable, and enduring.  These include cybersecurity, C5ISR, space, missile defense, transportation, environmental remediation, and water/wastewater treatment.  We utilize the following strategies, among others, towards achieving this goal:

• | We continuously evaluate and shape our portfolio to divest, exit and de-emphasize lower-performing businesses and markets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We invest in critical, differentiated technology areas, including remote sensing, joint all domain operations, space operations, cybersecurity, data analytics, command and control, environmental remediation and smart mobility.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We seek continuous expansion in our focused high-growth markets:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


o | Cybersecurity – Continue our growth momentum by offering end-to-end solutions, tools, operations and platforms for our U.S. Department of Defense and Intelligence Community customers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Space - Extend our space situational awareness, small satellite integration and payload, command and control and enterprise ground systems to our current space customers and to new space and geospatial customers in the government and commercial space markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | C5ISR – Move up the value chain to a large-scale integrator of C5ISR systems and diversify our customer base.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mergers and Acquisitions
 
We continue to pursue the acquisition and integration of high growth, technology driven companies which meet the following criteria: 
  
• | Financial performance goals: >10% top line growth, >10% Adjusted EBITDA margin, and strong cash flow
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Align to our focused markets
--+-----------------------------


• | Technology differentiation: fill technology gaps, drive end-to-end solutions, move up the value chain, scale within and across our businesses and add valuable intellectual property rights
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our objective is to continue to transform our business into an integrated, full life-cycle systems integrator that delivers scalable solutions and drives revenue growth, expanded margins, and strong cash flows.
 Backlog 
 We view growth in total backlog as a key measure of our business growth. We define backlog to include the following two components: 
  
• | Funded—Funded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenue previously recognized on these contracts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Unfunded—Unfunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenue previously recognized on these contracts.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Backlog includes (i) unissued task orders and unexercised option years, to the extent their issuance or exercise is probable, as well as (ii) contract awards, to the extent we believe contract execution and funding is probable. 
 Our backlog includes orders under contracts that can extend for several years, and in some cases, contracts that extend for more than 10 to 15 years. For example, the U.S. Congress generally appropriates funds for our U.S. federal government customers on a yearly basis, even though their contracts with us may call for performance that is expected to take a number of years to complete. As a result, our federal contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term.  All or some of the work to be performed under the contracts may remain unfunded unless and until the U.S. Congress makes subsequent appropriations and the procuring agency allocates funding to the contract.
 As of December 31, 2021, our total backlog was approximately $8.3 billion, consisting of $4.3 billion of funded backlog and $4.0 billion of unfunded backlog. We expect to recognize $2.9 billion of our funded backlog as of December 31, 2021 as revenues in the following twelve months. However, our government customers may cancel their contracts with us at any time through a termination for convenience or may elect to not exercise option periods under such contracts. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would not receive anticipated future revenues, but would generally be permitted to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed. 
 Competition 
 13


The industries we operate in consist of a large number of enterprises ranging from small, niche-oriented companies to multi-billion-dollar corporations that serve many governmental and commercial customers. We compete on the basis of our technical expertise, technological innovation, our ability to deliver cost-effective multi-faceted services in a timely manner, our reputation and relationships with our customers, qualified and/or security-clearance personnel, and pricing. Our main competitors in Federal Solutions are U.S. federal systems integrators and service providers such as Booz Allen Hamilton, CACI International Inc, Leidos Holdings, Inc., ManTech International Corporation, Science Applications International Corporation, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Peraton, and Raytheon Technologies. Our main competitors in Critical Infrastructure include AECOM, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Stantec, Tetra Tech, Inc., and WSP, as well as Kapsch and Opus in the Connected Communities market.  
Seasonality 
 Our results may be affected by variances as a result of weather conditions and contract award seasonality impacts that we experience across our businesses. The latter issue is typically driven by the U.S. federal government fiscal year-end, September 30. While not certain, it is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award task orders or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of the U.S. federal government fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended U.S. federal government fiscal year funds. Furthermore, many U.S. state governments with fiscal years ending on June 30 tend to accelerate spending during their first quarter, when new funding becomes available. We may continue to experience this seasonality in future periods, and our results of operations may be affected by it. 
Human Capital Management
 We are committed to enhancing our position as a leading employer in our industry. Our culture and reputation as a leading provider of technology-driven solutions in the defense, intelligence and critical infrastructure markets enables us to recruit and retain some of the best available talent across the globe.  We believe that we are stronger and smarter when we work together and celebrate our diverse backgrounds.  We believe in doing right by the communities we serve, and we have policies prohibiting discrimination (age, race or ethnicity, gender/gender identity, religion, sexual orientation or disability), child labor and human trafficking.  We believe that Parsons is the place for our diverse employees to make a difference. In 2021, we set a goal to enhance our gender diversity in the North America workforce and to enhance ethnic diversity in the U.S. workforce. We increased our diversity representation in the U.S. by 1.8% and continue to make progress for our female representation across Parsons.  This improvement was largely attributed to strong hiring in 2021 globally and lower overall attrition.  A high level of engagement among employees is reflected in our 2021 culture and engagement scores, which had over 40% participation and reflected significant improvements gained in survey areas such as overall employee satisfaction and collaboration among teams to achieve company goals and strong engagement scores with regard to managers supporting growth and development of employees, fostering a collaborative team environment where information and ideas are shared, and accountability from managers for high performance. 
 Our principal asset is our team of diverse employees.  A large percentage of our employees have technical and professional backgrounds and undergraduate and/or advanced degrees, with our employees holding more than 17,000 degrees and professional credentials, including registrations and certifications in technical areas such as Agile Methodology, Project Management, Engineering, Architecture, Green Building/Sustainability, Technology, and Security as of December 31, 2021.  Approximately 21% of our employees, including 57% of the employees in our Federal Solutions business segment, hold security clearances as of that date.  Of those holding such clearances in Federal Solutions, approximately 63% are Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information Level clearances, which often require the completion of a polygraph.
 14


In 2021, we focused on retaining and developing our employees on highly sought-after key programs as part of the knitting of our success.   Such programs include the mentoring program, Parsons Distinguished Recognition and Incentive Program (DRIVE), and the Parsons’ Fellows Program.
 Mentoring: The Parsons mentoring program allows employees to cultivate skills, seek guidance and share professional experiences.  The program is open to all employees at all levels worldwide and is voluntary. The program launched in 2020 is designed to:

• | Increase a sense of connection, engagement and retention of key diverse talent
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sustain promotion and retention rates of diverse leadership talent
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand networks and enhance career development opportunities
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 In 2021, Parsons recognized a 12.5% increase over 2020 mentor/mentee parings and increased the number of vice presidents participating in the program by 60% as compared to 2020 participation.
 Recognition:  Understanding recognition at all levels is key to management and retention.  We expanded Parsons Distinguished Recognition and Incentive (DRIVE) Program that celebrates employees who go above and beyond their work.  Launched in 2019, the program now has eight different award levels and is designed to reward employees who have made exceptional contributions to a program or project, or who have provided outstanding leadership or support to their teams, our clients, or our company as a whole, and serves to reinforce our commitment to our core values.  Over 4,500 awards were issued to employees in 2021, representing a nearly 33% increase over 2020 and the program continues to grow.  The DRIVE Program is open to all employees at all levels worldwide
 Development: The Parsons’ Fellows Program recognizes our top technical experts and promotes innovation in solving our customers’ most difficult technical challenges.  It is a collaborative network of over forty selected motivated and passionate subject matter experts working to solve technical challenges through either strategic research and development or through the development of long-term technical policies and best practices.  The program defines its success through engagement, mentorship, and retention.  Every benefit that collaboration among the Fellows offers is expressed by the idea that the individual is brilliant, but a group of brilliant individuals acting as one can be more powerful and enable Parsons to accomplish even more in our quest to deliver a better world.
 In addition to the Fellows Program, Parsons has a wealth of training and development opportunities that cover topics such as ethics and integrity, safety, inclusion and diversity, information security, program management, agile methodology and more.
 Inclusion Inspires Innovation
 Embracing inclusion, diversity and equality in all aspects of our business is fundamental to our corporate culture and vital to our continued growth and success.  Our employees work across 25 countries and collectively speak over 80 languages.  Diversity is one of our core values, and we pursue it in our workforce, our markets, our suppliers, and our services because we recognize that optimum solutions require different backgrounds, new perspectives, and open minds.  We leverage diversity and equality through the inclusion of employees, empowering them to shape the future of the corporation through collaboration and innovation.
 In 2017, we launched our Inclusion and Diversity (I&D) Task Force with executive sponsorship from the Board, our CEO, our President and COO, and our Chief Human Resources Officer.  The task force’s objectives are to support the attraction, inclusion, promotion, development, and retention of talent.  In 2021, we changed the name from Inclusion and Diversity to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), adding equity to the name to ensure we also have a focus on the fair treatment of all employees.  The overall DEI Council consists of 44 diverse members serving as committee members, ambassadors and employee business resource group leaders throughout the organization, who demonstrate leadership and infuse their passion for inclusion, equity and diversity into our corporate culture and engage all employees 
 15


through ongoing awareness communications and training, activities, and events.  Within the task force, subcommittees support the development and implementation of initiatives identified by the Board, the Executive Leadership Team and employee business resource groups that continue to advance our inclusion and diversity objectives.  The task force has the following subcommittees:
  
• | Metrics – Measure the success of inclusion and diversity
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | Mentoring/Training – Drive improved awareness and engagement
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ambassadors – Bring inclusion and diversity to the local level to create inclusion and diversity awareness
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Communications – Promote inclusion and diversity awareness through messaging and celebration
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Executive/Intern Diversity – Drive improved diversity at the intern and executive levels
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Policy Review – Improve inclusion and diversity through policy change
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Social Justice and Equality – Advance social justice and equality inside and outside of Parsons
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Military and Veterans Affairs – Attract veterans and cultivate their careers and success
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pride Alliance – Advocate for the LGBTQ+
--+-----------------------------------------

 With recent social justice and equality awakening, we launched seven new Employee Business Resource Groups (EBRG): Asian American/Pacific Islander; Black; HOLA-Hispanic Origin and Latino Association; Middle Eastern/North African; MilVet; Parsons Pride Alliance; and Parsons Women’s Roundtable.   Through our Listen Learn Action campaign launched in 2020, we continue to drive an action plan that holds us accountable to doing more to increase the representation of historically underrepresented groups within our global workforce, and we are committed to taking action and ensuring Parsons is, and remains, an employer of choice.
 Employee Stock Ownership Plan
 At December 31, 2021, approximately 6,300 of our employees participated in our Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).  Thus, our employees own approximately 40% of the total outstanding shares in the ESOP.  In December 2020, the board of directors approved an amendment to the ESOP to provide greater diversification rights to participants.  The amendment provides that, with respect to all diversifications elected or processed after January 1, 2021, the definition of a qualified participant shall mean a participant who has attained the age of 50 and who has completed at least three years of participation in the ESOP and other criteria.  Each qualified participant shall generally be permitted to direct the ESOP as to the diversification of 50% of the value of the eligible vested portion of the participant’s ESOP account.  Further, in January 2021, the board of directors approved an amendment to the ESOP whereby distributions to participants in the Plan were modified as follows: (1) the threshold amount of an ESOP participant’s balance to be eligible for a single lump sum distribution was increased from $20,000 or less to $500,000 or less; (2) the threshold balance for a participant to be eligible to receive payment in two annual installments was increased from $40,000 or less to $750,000 or less; and (3) the threshold balance for a participant to be eligible to receive payment in three annual installments was increased to greater than $750,000.  This change was made to facilitate greater flexibility for certain eligible participants to receive their balances in fewer installments and to accelerate the increase in publicly traded float for the Company’s common stock.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
 At the 2020 Annual Meeting of Parsons’ Shareholders, the shareholders approved the implementation of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).  The ESPP provides an opportunity for eligible employees (as defined in the ESPP) to purchase Parsons’ stock.  By participating in the ESPP, an eligible employee may purchase Parsons’ shares at a 5% discount from the New York Stock Exchange closing price at the end date for each offering period (June 30th and December 31st of each year).  In 2021, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Parsons’ Board of Directors approved a special three-month offering period for eligible employees of BlackHorse Solutions and its 
 16


eligible subsidiary companies.  During 2021 and 202, our employees purchased approximately 161,000 and 127,000 shares, respectively, of Parsons’ stock.
 Stock Repurchase Plan
       On August 9, 2021, the board of directors authorized Parsons Corporation to acquire a number of shares of common stock having an aggregate market value of not greater than $100,000,000 from time to time, commencing on August 12, 2021.  The Board authorized management to execute any agreements providing for the repurchase of the Company’s stock, subject to such conditions, on behalf of the company in such lots, blocks or other amounts, from such persons or entities, from such sources, on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, on such terms and conditions, from time to time, in accordance with applicable federal and state regulations.  As of December 31, 2021, the company had repurchased 618,533 shares of common stock at an average price per share of $35.06 for a total amount of $21.7 million.

Intellectual Property 
 Our intellectual property portfolio consists of issued and pending patents as well as trademarks for many of our technologies. In addition, we maintain a number of trade secrets that we endeavor to protect to ensure their continuing availability to us. Our technical expertise is vital to our growth strategy, and we believe they are a core competitive advantage.  We have 35 registered patents and 22 pending patents in the United States and 12 pending patents internationally.  We have 85 trademarks and 7 pending trademark applications in the United States, and 126 trademarks and 30 pending trademark applications internationally. We also currently offer 25 products for sale to our global customers.
 We rely upon a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements, as well as copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary information. We also enter into proprietary information and intellectual property agreements with employees, which require them to disclose any inventions created during employment, to convey such rights to inventions to us and to restrict any disclosure of proprietary information. While protecting trade secrets and proprietary information is important, we are not materially dependent on maintenance of any specific trade secret or group of trade secrets. 
 During the normal course of business, we perform research and development and technology consulting services and related products in support of our customers. Typically, these services do not depend on patent protection. In accordance with applicable law, our government contracts often provide government agencies certain license rights to our inventions, copyrights, and other intellectual property. Government agencies may in turn sublicense to other contractors (including our competitors) the right to utilize our intellectual property. In addition, in the case of our work as a subcontractor, our prime contractor may also have certain rights to data, information and products we develop under the subcontract. At the same time, our government contracts often license to us patents, copyrights and other intellectual property owned by third parties.
 Regulation 
 Our business is impacted by government procurement, anti-bribery, international trade, environmental, health and safety and other regulations and requirements. Below is a summary of some of the significant regulations that impact our business. 
 Government Procurement.    The services we provide to the U.S. Government are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, the Truthful Cost and Pricing Data Act, Cost Accounting Standards, or CAS, the Services Contract Act, the False Claims Act, export controls rules and U.S. Department of Defense security regulations, as well as government agency policies and many other laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. A violation of specific laws and regulations 
 17


could lead to fines, contract termination or suspension of future contracts. Generally, our government clients can also terminate, renegotiate, or modify any of their contracts with us at their convenience, and many of our government contracts are subject to renewal or extension annually.
 In 2019, the U.S. Department of Defense announced the development of Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (“CMMC”) as a framework to assess and enhance the cybersecurity posture of the Defense Industrial Base (“DIB”), particularly as it relates to controlled unclassified information within the supply chain. CMMC is designed to ensure that contractors providing services to the U.S. Department of Defense have implemented cybersecurity controls and processes to adequately protect information that resides on DIB systems and networks.  The U.S. Department of Defense issued an interim rule on September 29, 2020 to amend the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to include one new provision and two new contract clauses.  It became effective on November 30, 2020.   We collaborated with other companies to provide feedback following the 60-day public comment period.  In December 2020, the U.S. Department of Defense identified seven approved pilots of the expected fifteen for fiscal year 2021 that are new Requests for Proposals which will be incorporated into CMMC requirements.  All offerors are expected to undergo appropriate third-party CMMC assessment and achieve certification of Level 3 and below at the time of contract award.  We are currently in compliance and are preparing for future certification and assessments.
  Anti-Bribery and other regulations.    We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. In addition, an organization that “fails to prevent bribery” committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the U.K. Bribery Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented “adequate procedures” to prevent bribery. 
 International Trade.    We are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, and the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, as well as U.S. economic and trade sanctions, including those administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. To the extent we export items and provide services outside of the United States (or to certain parties in the United States), we must do so in compliance with these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose export licensing requirements, and we may not be successful in obtaining necessary licenses and other authorizations. Further, these laws and regulations restrict our ability to export items or provide services to certain countries and certain persons, including those that are the target of OFAC sanctions. Noncompliance with these or similar laws could lead to government investigations, penalties, reputational harm, and other negative consequences, and thereby could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Further, any change in these laws and regulations, or any shift in the approach to their enforcement or scope, or change to the countries, persons, or items targeted by such regulations, could potentially result in our decreased ability to export or sell items or services to existing or potential customers. 
 Environmental, Health and Safety.    We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental, health and safety matters, including, among other things, the handling, transport and disposal of regulated substances and wastes, including hazardous and radioactive materials; contamination by regulated substances and wastes; the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; the acquisition of a permit or other approval before conducting regulated activities; the maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees, state and local government authorities and the public; and employee health and safety. Our previous ownership and current and previous operation of real property may subject us to liability pursuant to these laws or regulations. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and related state laws, certain persons may be liable at sites where or from a release or threatened release of hazardous substances has occurred or is threatened. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where a release or threatened release occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the release occurred, and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the 
 18


transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability under CERCLA is strict, retroactive and, under certain circumstances, joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, regulates the generation, treatment, storage, handling, transportation and disposal of solid waste and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. Under RCRA, persons may be liable at sites where the past or present storage, handling, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where disposal occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the disposal occurred, and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability under RCRA is strict and, under certain circumstances, joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances. Violations and liabilities with respect to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could result in significant administrative, civil, or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups, natural resource damages, permit modifications or revocations, operational interruptions or shutdowns and other liabilities. Additionally, Congress, state legislatures, local governing bodies and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes could result in more stringent or costly requirements for our operations. Our costs related to complying with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations have not been material in the past and are not currently material to our total operating costs or cash flows. However, if we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations in the future, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, in the unlikely event that we are required to fund remediation of a contaminated site, the statutory framework might allow us to pursue rights of contribution from other potentially responsible parties. 
 We maintain a compliance program designed to ensure compliance with the various regulations and requirements applicable to us. The compliance program, managed by our Chief Ethics and Compliance Counsel and overseen by our Chief Compliance Officer, includes an annual audit of performance with respect to our codes of ethics and business conduct and the adequacy of our compliance program, among other initiatives. 
 Executive Order 14042 and OSHA Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS).  In September 2021, President Joseph R. Biden issued Executive Order 14042 requiring federal government contractors to ensure that their employees are vaccinated, subject to certain medical or religious exceptions.  Further, the Occupational Safety and Health Authority published an ETS on vaccination and testing on November 5, 2021 requiring companies with more than 100 employees to ensure that their employees are vaccinated or require unvaccinated employees to get a negative COVID test at least once per week. However, based upon a decision by the United States Supreme Court staying enforcement of the OSHA ETS, OSHA withdrew the ETS on January 24, 2022. The enforcement of Executive Order 14042 was preliminarily enjoined by an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia.  The preliminary injunction currently remains in effect.  Parsons Corporation is closely following the legal status of Executive Order 14042 and has implemented plans to ensure compliance with both based upon the final legal determinations.
