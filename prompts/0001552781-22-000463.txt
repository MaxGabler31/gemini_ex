ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Organization
 
We were incorporated in the state of Nevada on July 8, 2015. On November 4, 2015, we conducted the Share Exchange with Rent Pay, which became our wholly owned subsidiary
Industry Background

Recent Developments
 

(a) | We have previously Embarked on a Proof of Concept, web development project with LEWFIN AMERICA for their operations in Texas. We have a December 12, 2018, titled Proof of Concept (POC) to Supply and Develop Software Systems Agreement with LEWFIN AMERICA LLC to develop an online lending website for them and to further customize and develop our loan management system to the industry needs and the needs of LEWFIN in Texas. The POC would run for a period of 12 months and expire on January 7, 2020, however, we decided to continue with the agreement on a month-to-month basis because the input and feedback received from the LEWFIN group has been valuable. LEWFIN has since gone live with some of their branches on our software system. In exchange for the industry knowledge and input supplied by LEWFIN during this POC, UPAY will continue to make the website and loan management system available to LEWFIN free of charge on a month-to-month basis, following the expiration of the POC period. All new development and customization will remain our sole property. We plan to renegotiate with LEWFIN the terms of our arrangement with them, including LEWFINS paying for services rendered, including software rental, transaction fees and software development.

(b) | Completed software integrations with two US payment systems, namely Loan Payment Pro and Repay. We also integrated with a US credit bureau, Factor Trust, Clarity, and a Global document verifying company, Decision Logic. We completed integrations with Payliance, a payment system, Dot818 and Lead Envy who are lead providers in the US. We have also signed a Master Services Agreement with Yodlee, a Global bank account and transaction verification company in order to integrate their services to access consumer bank account information for customers and to make better credit decisions.

(c) | Due to the cumbersome process and the difficulties and delays experienced by some new UPAY clients, during the course of their company registrations, including regulator registrations, opening of bank accounts and opening accounts with various third-party vendors, UPAY explored the opportunity to look at easier ways to assist new clients with these registrations and to help facilitate the process on behalf of potential new clients. We believe that a group model would address the cumbersome and lengthy application processes of new clients to assist smaller lenders in accessing the credit market and to minimize the risk and compliance issues. 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
With such a model, investors or businesses looking to enter the credit industry could theoretically easily join an existing group that already complies with the regulators and has other registrations in place, in its own capacity and in this way allow investors to access the existing infrastructure of the group to gain access to the consumer lending market much faster and with the guidance and know-how of the group, with the existing registrations and relationships of the group already in place.
 
Our Board of Directors approved the adoption of such a group business as a separate structure and independent business to our existing business.
 
MiWay Finance, Inc. (“MiWay”) was incorporated in Texas on May 26, 2020. On June 10, 2020, UPAY entered into a Stock Purchase agreement with MiWay Finance, Inc whereby UPAY acquired 20,000,000 shares in MiWay in exchange for an investment of $20,000. This investment represents 48.66% of the shareholding held in MiWay. MiWay will run separate and independent from us but use our software, services and integrations exclusively for all its clients. MiWay will sign a Service Level Agreement with UPAY for services to be rendered, with agreed level of service and fees.

South African Business Operation:
 
Our South African subsidiary, Rent Pay (Pty) Ltd, currently provides a web-based client and loan administration software platform, the Automated Credit Provider Administration System, to registered lenders in South Africa, which we market under the name ACPAS.
 
Our customer base consists of customers with physical branch outlets as well as online customers with lending websites. ACPAS was designed to bridge the gap between traditional standalone administration platforms, payment gateways, credit bureaus and other third-party service providers through this fully automated software platform.
 
We provide a cloud-based loan origination software system that is compliant with all applicable legislation and enables our customers to grant loans, sell products, pay bills or pay monthly subscriptions on terms, all within our software system. Our software platform features integrated third-party service providers are, for example, registered payment gateways, credit bureaus, two-way texting, credit protection insurance and decision-making platforms. We also develop tailor-made web sites for our customers that is fully integrated with our ACPAS system. Our system also includes basic accounting and bookkeeping functionality.
 
In an effort to reduce the cost of our US operations, in November 2021, we decided to close the sales office in Grapevine Texas and to only keep the registered Dallas office at this point in time. As of February 2022, we no longer pursue US sales and operations because of: (a) the resignation of our previous Chief Executive Officer, Wouter Fouche, in February 2022 who was to direct our planned US operations and the need to appoint new staff; (b) need to raise adequate funding to pursue and complete a successful US rollout; and (c) our current staff resources are restrained and the time difference between the US and South Africa and the location of all our staff resources in South Africa and the lingering effects of Covid presents difficulties. We will focus our entire sales effort in Southern Africa, first to expand in South Africa and then into Namibia and Botswana.

Government Regulation
 
Our customers products and services are subject to extensive US local, state and federal regulation and South African regulations. The regulation of the loan products and services industry is intended primarily for the protection of consumers and is constantly in flux as new regulations are introduced and existing regulations are repealed, amended, and modified.
South Africa Credit Regulations (The National Credit Act)
 
The National Credit Act (NCA) regulates the South Africa credit industry and was designed to protect consumer in the credit market and make credit and banking services more accessible. The Purpose of the NCA Act is to: promote a fair and non-discriminatory marketplace for access to consumer credit; regulate consumer credit and improve standards of Consumer information; prohibit certain unfair credit and credit marketing practices; promote responsible credit granting and use; prohibit reckless credit granting; provide for debt re-organization in case of over-indebtedness; to regulate credit information; and establish recourse for unfair credit practices. The NCA does this by simplifying and standardizing credit agreements and information disclosure; providing for the use of simple language that is easy to understand for comparing credit agreements from different credit providers; ensures all credit products are handled in the same way by credit providers; assisting over-indebted Consumers to restructure their debt with the help of a Debt Counselor (DC) and encourage responsible lending; regulates credit bureaus in terms of their Consumer information and records; establishing the National Credit Regulator (NCR) to regulate the entire credit market; and establishing the National Consumer Tribunal (CT) to adjudicate on Consumer complaints and disputes with credit providers, contraventions of The Act and decisions of the Regulator.
 
The NCA affects anyone dealing with the credit industry such as credit grantors, credit grantees and intermediaries. The NCA defines a credit agreement broadly as any installment purchase agreement of goods or services, as well as the extension of credit in the form of money i.e. home loans, personal loans, credit cards, store cards and short-term loans. Therefore, a credit agreement applies to any party involved in the credit agreement which is classified into three categories namely incidental credit agreements; intermediate agreements; and large credit agreements.
 
Credit Providers include banks, micro lenders, retailers such as furniture and clothing stores, all businesses, companies, close corporations, partnerships and individuals who do business on credit, provide loans or charge interest on overdue accounts. Consumers Include natural person, companies, close corporations, trusts (with more than three individual trustees), partnerships and an association of persons whose asset value or annual turnover, together with the combined asset value or annual turnover of all related juristic persons, at the time the agreement is made, equals or exceeds the threshold value of 1 million rands.
 
The NCA lists a number of consumer rights, which are protected by the Act. A party who breaches Consumer rights protected by the NCA commits an offence in terms of credit law, which enables Consumer recourse through the established dispute channels. The following are Consumer rights protected in the NCA:
 

○ | To apply for credit 
--+------------------------


○ | To be protected against discrimination in the granting of credit 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | To be informed why credit has not been granted, should you ask 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | To receive a free copy of your credit agreement 
--+----------------------------------------------------


○ | To receive a credit agreement in plain and simple language 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


○ | To have your personal and financial information treated confidential 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | To understand all fees, costs, interest rates, the total installment and any other details 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | To say no to increases on your credit limit 
--+------------------------------------------------


○ | To decide whether or not you want to be informed about products or services via telephone, SMS, mail or e-mail campaigns 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | To apply for debt counseling should you be overwhelmed by debt 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The key points of the NCA are:
 
1. Marketing
 
The NCA restricts and prohibits certain practices of loan canvassing such as door to door selling, uninvited canvassing at workplaces or homes. The NCA also increased control over marketing practices and advertisements such as automatic credit limit increases and negative option marketing i.e. if you do not decline, we will assume you agree. In addition, the National Credit Act provides for clear and understandable marketing communication. Consumers must receive a detailed written quote, which is valid for 5 business days, to enable quote comparisons from different credit providers.
  F-8

 
2. Capped Interest Rates and Other Fees and Charges
 
The NCA effectively caps the interest rates, fees and other charges, which credit providers, can charge, depending on the type of credit and when the credit was granted. The maximum interest rate, in most cases, is based on a formula, which is dependent on the SA Reserve Bank Repurchase (Repo) rate at the time that the credit was granted. Essentially, there are seven rate categories namely mortgage agreements; credit cards/facilities; unsecured credit transactions; short-term credit transactions; developmental credit agreements; other credit agreements and incidental credit agreements. The NCA places a cap on the maximum amount that a credit provider can charge for other fees such as initiation fees, monthly service, and default and collection costs. While a loan protection policy is permitted, the charges must be reasonable and the Consumer may use/cede an existing insurance cover.
3. Loan Application
 
The NCA requires credit providers to supply simple contracts that are easy to understand, in official languages and the Consumer must receive a free copy. Consumers are also entitled to a reason, on request, when the credit provider denies credit. The NCA requires credit providers to do due diligence to ensure the Consumer can afford the loan and all loans must be recorded on a register to prevent Consumers becoming over-indebted.
4. Reckless Lending
 
Credit providers are in contravention of the NCA and may be judged guilty of reckless lending if the Consumers ability to afford loan repayments is not assessed before granting credit. Credit providers may be subject to severe penalties and may even forfeit their right to recover the debt if they are judged guilty of reckless lending. However, Consumers who failed to fill in the loan application fully and honestly are not protected by the NCA.
5. Debt Counselor & Counseling
 
The NCA gives Consumers the right to apply for financial management and debt counseling assistance if he or she is unable to pay their debts. The Debt Counselor (DC) is registered by the NCR after successful course and exam completion. Debt counselors will help over-indebted Consumers restructure/rearrange their debt repayments, this process can be voluntary or made an order of the court.
 
All DCs must be registered with the National Credit Regulator and fees are prescribed in terms of the NCA. Consumers must understand and accept the process, charges and payments before undergoing debt counseling. Once the Consumer has signed for debt counseling, the credit bureau is notified, and the Consumer will be unable to obtain further credit for the duration of debt counseling until the process is finalized/withdrawn.
 
6. Credit Bureau
 
The NCA requires all credit bureau to be registered with and submit reports to the National Credit Regulator. Credit bureau are required to ensure data is accurate at all times and that inaccurate information is immediately removed without cost to the Consumer after the Consumer has lodged a complaint. The NCA regulations stipulate how Credit bureau information is obtained, used, and for how long it should remain on a Consumers profile.
 
In addition, Consumers are eligible for one free credit report from each credit bureau each year to effectively manage their credit profiles.
 
7. The National Credit Regulator and the Consumer Tribunal
 
The NCA established the NCR to regulate the credit industry and ensure that credit providers comply with the NCA. In addition, the NCR is responsible for investigating and evaluating Consumer complaints about alleged contraventions of the NCA by credit providers. All credit providers, credit bureau and debt counselors must register and report to the NCR.
 
In addition to the NCR, the NCA established the Consumer Tribunal with equal status to a court of law to hear and adjudicate on: applications made in terms of the NCA by consumers; credit providers and credit bureau; debt counselors and the NCR including applications for interim relief and a review of the NCRs decisions; matters referred to by the NCR or complaints related to allegations of prohibited
