Item 1. Business
THE COMPANY
We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT with in-house capabilities, including asset management, acquistion, credit, research, finance, IT and accounting functions. We primarily invest in single-tenant, operationally essential real estate throughout the U.S., which is generally acquired through sale-leaseback transactions and subsequently leased on a long-term, triple-net basis to high-quality tenants with business operations within predominantly retail, but also office and industrial property types.
We began operations through a predecessor legal entity in 2003, which became a public company in December 2004 and was subsequently taken private in August 2007 by a consortium of private investors. On September 25, 2012, we completed our initial public offering and on July 17, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Cole II through the Merger. The surviving entity, which was renamed Spirit Realty Capital, Inc., began trading on the NYSE under the symbol "SRC." Cole II was the "legal acquirer" in the Merger for certain legal and regulatory matters and the Corporation was deemed the "accounting acquirer" in the Merger for accounting and financial reporting purposes, including the financial information set forth herein. On May 31, 2018, the Company completed the Spin-Off of SMTA which included all of the assets that collateralize Master Trust 2014, all of the Company's properties leased to Shopko, and certain other assets.

In conjunction with the Spin-Off, the Company entered into the Asset Management Agreement with SMTA, pursuant to which the Company acts as external asset manager for SMTA and is entitled to an annual management fee of $20.0 million per annum. 
As of December 31, 2018, our undepreciated gross investment in real estate and loans totaled approximately $5.12 billion, representing investments in 1,514 properties, including properties securing our mortgage loans. Of this amount, 99.1% consisted of our gross investment in real estate, representing ownership of 1,462 properties, and the remaining 0.9% consisted primarily of commercial mortgage loans receivable secured by 52 real properties. See Item 2. "Properties - Our Real Estate Investment Portfolio" for further information on our properties and tenants. 
Our operations are carried out through the Operating Partnership. OP Holdings, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, is the sole general partner and owns approximately 1% of the Operating Partnership. We and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are the only limited partners and together own the remaining 99% of the Operating Partnership.
Although the Operating Partnership is wholly-owned by us, in the future, we may issue partnership interests in the Operating Partnership to third parties in exchange for assets owned by such third parties. In general, any partnership interests of the Operating Partnership issued to third parties would be exchangeable for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock at specified ratios set when partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are issued. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 89 employees, as compared to 87 employees as of December 31, 2017. None of these employees are represented by a labor union.
BUSINESS AND GROWTH STRATEGIES 
Our objective is to maximize stockholder value by seeking superior risk-adjusted returns with an emphasis on stable rental revenue, primarily by investing in and managing a portfolio of single-tenant, operationally essential real estate throughout the U.S. We generate revenue primarily by leasing our properties to our tenants. See Item 2. "Properties" for property information and Item 6. "Selected Financial Data" for additional financial and asset information. 
Single-tenant, operationally essential real estate consists of properties that are generally free-standing, commercial real estate facilities where our tenants conduct activities essential to the generation of their sales and profits. Under a triple-net lease, the tenant is typically responsible for all improvements and is contractually obligated to pay all property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, insurance premiums and repair and maintenance costs. In support of our primary business of owning and leasing real estate, we have also strategically originated or acquired long-term, commercial mortgage and other loans. We view our operations as one reporting segment consisting of net leasing operations. We intend to pursue our objective through the following business and growth strategies:
Enhanced Portfolio Management Using Proprietary Tools
When monitoring existing investments or evaluating new investments, we typically consider three broad categories of risk: (1) tenant financial distress risk, (2) lease renewal risk and (3) suboptimal lease structures. We seek to manage these risks by utilizing our Spirit Heat Map and Spirit Property Ranking Model, as well as our overall internal credit underwriting and risk management processes. Since our inception, our Occupancy, a measure of portfolio quality, has never fallen below 96.1%, despite the economic downturn of 2008 through 2010.

◦ | Focus on Diversified Assets in Target Industries. Our investment strategy will be to continue to increase our exposure to industries that we determine are attractive based on our proprietary Spirit Heat Map and where we believe we are underweight. On the disposition side, we intend to reduce industry concentration based on the Spirit Heat Map and where we believe we are overweight. The Spirit Heat Map is used to analyze tenant industries across Porter’s Five Forces and potential causes of technological disruption to identify tenant industries that we believe to have good fundamentals for future performance. The Spirit Heat Map is updated regularly to factor for changes in business and market conditions, changes in technology and other trends. Desirable tenants have attractive credit characteristics and stable operating histories. This strategy offers us the opportunity to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns when coupled with our intensive credit and real estate analysis, lease structuring and ongoing portfolio management.

We also monitor and manage the diversification of our real estate investment portfolio in order to reduce the risks associated with adverse developments affecting a particular tenant, property, or region. Our strategy emphasizes a portfolio that (1) derives no more than 10.0% of its annual rent from any single tenant and no more than 2.0% of its annual rent from any single property, (2) is leased to tenants operating in various industries aligned with our Spirit Heat Map and (3) is located across the U.S. without significant 
7

geographic concentration. While we consider the foregoing when making investments, we have made, and may make investments in the future that do not meet one or more of these criteria, and we may make additional investments that do not meet one or more of these criteria if we believe the opportunity is sufficiently attractive. 

◦ | Focus on Active Portfolio Management Decisions. We use our proprietary Spirit Property Ranking Model to rank all properties in our portfolio, across twelve factors and weightings consisting of both real estate quality scores and credit underwriting criteria, in order to benchmark property quality, identify asset recycling opportunities and to enhance acquisition and disposition decisions. The Spirit Property Ranking Model is a key component of both the acquisition and disposition process, as well as the process for identifying asset recycling opportunities.

We selectively make acquisitions that we believe will contribute to our business objectives. We believe there will be ample acquisition opportunities in the single-tenant market fitting our underwriting and acquisition criteria. This criteria includes, but is not limited to, evaluation of the rank from our Spirit Property Ranking Model and impact on our portfolio’s tenant, industry and geographic diversification. 
We typically retain and manage real estate assets that fit within our investment criteria, which criteria are subject to change without notice to or vote by our stockholders. Additionally, management may elect to dispose of assets when it believes appropriate in view of our business objective, considering criteria including, but not limited to, the Spirit Heat Map, the rank from the Spirit Property Ranking Model, tenant concentration, tenant credit quality, unit financial performance, associated indebtedness, and asset zoning, as well as potential capital appreciation, potential uses of proceeds and tax considerations, among others.
Execute Leases with Optimal Structures
We seek to maintain the stability of our rental revenue and the long-term return on our investments by entering into leases with structures we deem to be aligned with our business and growth strategies:

◦ | Leases for Operationally Essential Real Estate. We seek to own properties that are operationally essential to our tenants, thereby reducing the risk that the tenant would choose not to renew an expiring lease or reject a lease in bankruptcy.


◦ | Enhance Our Portfolio through Contractual Rental Growth. Approximately 85.3% of our single-tenant properties (based on Contractual Rent) contain contractual provisions that increase the rental revenue over the term of the lease. Generally, our rent escalators increase rent at specified dates by: (1) a fixed amount; or (2) the lesser of (a) 1 to 2 times any increase in the CPI over a specified period, (b) a fixed percentage, or (c) a fixed schedule.


◦ | Leases with Relatively Long Terms. We seek to enter into leases with relatively long terms, typically with non-cancelable initial terms of 15 to 20 years and tenant renewal options for additional terms with attractive rent escalation provisions.


◦ | Leases with a Master Lease Structure. Where appropriate, we seek to enter into master leases whereby we lease multiple properties to a single tenant on an “all or none” basis. In a master lease structure, a tenant is responsible for a single lease payment relating to the entire portfolio of leased properties, as opposed to separate lease payments relating to each individually leased property. The master lease structure hinders a tenant's ability to “cherry pick” locations, where it unilaterally gives up underperforming properties while maintaining its leasehold interest in well-performing properties.

FINANCING STRATEGY 
Our long-term financing strategy is to maintain a leverage profile that creates operational flexibility and generates superior risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders. We finance our operations and investments using a variety of methods, including available unrestricted cash balances, property operating revenue, proceeds from property dispositions, available borrowings under our credit facilities, common and preferred stock issuances, and debt securities issuances, including mortgage indebtedness and senior unsecured debt. We determine the amount of equity and debt financing to be used when acquiring an asset by evaluating our cost of equity capital, terms available in the credit markets (such as interest rate, repayment provisions and maturity) and our assessment of the particular asset’s risk. 
8

We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows the offering proceeds to be accretively invested into additional properties, to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facilities, or to repay outstanding debt at or before maturity. 
In September 2017, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which became immediately effective upon filing and will remain effective for a term of three years with an expiration in September 2020. Under this shelf registration statement, we may offer shares of our common or preferred stock or debt securities from time to time in amounts, at prices and on terms to be announced when and if such shares are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds from any such offerings, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of such offerings.
We have issued senior unsecured debt securities and have obtained other senior unsecured debt at the Operating Partnership level. In addition, our debt historically has also consisted of long-term borrowings secured by specific real estate assets or, more typically, pools of real estate assets. These secured borrowings include the issuance of non-recourse net-lease mortgage notes under Master Trust 2013, as well as non-recourse loans which have been securitized into CMBS debt. To the extent practicable, we expect to maintain a well-balanced debt profile with manageable and balanced maturities.
We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs, and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our available credit facilities and periodically through issuances of public securities.
We anticipate that we will continue to use a number of different sources to finance our acquisitions and operations going forward; however, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital and credit markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Financing Activities
2019 Facilities Agreement
On January 14, 2019, the Operating Partnership entered into a new 2019 Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and various lenders, comprised of the 2019 Credit Facility and the A-1 Term Loans. 
The 2019 Credit Facility is comprised of $800.0 million of aggregate revolving commitments with a maturity date of March 31, 2023. The outstanding loans under the 2019 Credit Facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.10% per annum and the aggregate revolving commitments incur a facility fee of 0.25% per annum, in each case, based on the Operating Partnership’s credit rating. The 2019 Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement includes an accordion feature providing for an additional $400.0 million of revolving borrowing capacity, subject to the satisfaction of certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments.
The A-1 Term Loans have an aggregate borrowing amount of $420.0 million with a maturity date of March 31, 2024. The A-1 Term Loans currently bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.25% per annum based on the Operating Partnership’s credit rating. The Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement includes an accordion feature providing for an additional $200.0 million of term loans, subject to satisfying certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments. 
In addition, on January 14, 2019, the Operating Partnership entered into new A-2 Term Loans with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and various lenders, comprised of $400 million of delayed draw term loans with a maturity date of March 31, 2022.

Real Estate Portfolio Activities
Concentration
During the month ended December 31, 2018, no tenant exceeded 5.0% of our Contractual Rent, and no one single property contributed more than 2.0% of our Contractual Rent. See Item 2. “Properties - Our Real Estate Investment Portfolio" for further information on our ten largest tenants and the composition of our tenant base.
Acquisitions and Dispositions
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased 17 properties which are included in continuing operations, representing an aggregate gross investment of $250.8 million, and invested $36.2 million in revenue producing capital expenditures to fund improvements on properties the Company currently owns. During the same period, we sold 29 properties from continuing operations for $103.3 million in gross sales proceeds. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of our investments. 
Other Activities
Haggen Settlement
In 2015, Haggen Holdings, LLC and a number of its affiliates, including Haggen Operations Holdings, LLC ("Haggen"), filed petitions for bankruptcy. At the time of the filing, Haggen leased 20 properties from a subsidiary of the Company under a master lease. The Company and Haggen restructured the master lease in an initial settlement agreement with approved claims of $21.0 million. In 2016, the Company entered into a second settlement agreement with both Haggen and Albertsons, LLC for $3.4 million and $3.0 million, respectively. Prior to 2018, the Company collected $5.5 million of the total claims. In December 2018, the Company received final settlement proceeds of $19.7 million and no other claims related to the Haggen settlement remain outstanding.
COMPETITION
We face competition for acquisitions from investors, including traded and non-traded public REITs, and private equity and institutional investment funds, some of which have greater financial resources than we do, a greater ability to borrow funds to acquire properties and the ability to accept more risk than we can prudently manage. This competition may increase the demand for the types of properties in which we typically invest and, therefore, reduce the number of suitable acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the prices paid for such. This competition will increase if investments in real estate become more attractive relative to other forms of investment.
As a landlord, we compete in the multi-billion dollar commercial real estate market with numerous developers and owners of properties, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. In operating and managing our portfolio, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors, including location, rental rates and flexibility. Some of our competitors have greater economies of scale, have lower cost of capital, have access to more resources and have greater name recognition than we do. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose our tenants or prospective tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates or to offer substantial rent abatements, tenant improvement allowances, early termination rights or below-market renewal options in order to retain tenants when our leases expire.
REGULATION
General 
Our properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that each of our properties has the necessary permits and approvals. 
Americans With Disabilities Act 
Pursuant to the ADA, our properties are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA, as well as a number of additional federal, state and local laws and regulations, may require modifications to properties we currently own and any properties we purchase, or may restrict renovations 
10

of those properties. Noncompliance with these laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants, as well as the incurrence of the costs of making modifications to attain compliance, and future legislation could impose additional financial obligations or restrictions on our properties. Although our tenants are generally responsible for all maintenance and repair costs pursuant to triple-net leases, including compliance with the ADA and other similar laws or regulations, we could be held liable as the owner of the property for a failure of one of our tenants to comply with such laws or regulations. 
Environmental Matters 
Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regulate, and impose liability for, releases of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. Under various of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner, operator or tenant of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances, hazardous wastes or petroleum product releases or threats of releases at the property, and may be held liable to a government entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred by those parties in connection with actual or threatened contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to fault, or whether or not the owner, operator or tenant knew of or caused the presence of the contamination. The liability under these laws may be joint and several for the full amount of the investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred or to be incurred or actions to be undertaken, although a party held jointly and severally liable may seek contributions from other identified, solvent, responsible parties for their fair share toward these costs. These costs may be substantial, and can exceed the value of the property. The presence of contamination, or the failure to properly remediate contamination, on a property may adversely affect the ability of the owner, operator or tenant to sell or rent that property or to borrow using the property as collateral and may adversely impact our investment in that property. 
Some of our properties contain, have contained, or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Similarly, some of our properties are or were used for commercial or industrial purposes that involve or involved the use of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or are adjacent to or near properties that have been or are used for similar commercial or industrial purposes. These operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, and we could potentially be required to pay to clean up any contamination. In addition, strict environmental laws regulate a variety of activities that can occur on a property, including the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, air emissions and water discharges. Such laws may impose fines or penalties for violations. As a result of the foregoing, we could be materially and adversely affected. 
Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of ACM. Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building’s management to identify and warn, through signs and labels, of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed ACM in their building. The regulations also have employee training, record keeping and due diligence requirements pertaining to ACM. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations. As a result of these regulations, building owners and those exercising control over a building’s management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits by workers and others exposed to ACM. The regulations may affect the value of a building containing ACM in which we have invested. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling and/or disposal of ACM when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release into the environment of ACM and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with ACM. 
When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. We are not presently aware of any material adverse indoor air quality issues at our properties that have not been previously addressed or remediated by us. 
11

Before completing any property acquisition, we obtain environmental assessments in order to identify potential environmental concerns at the property. These assessments are carried out in accordance with the Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments (ASTM Practice E 1527-05) as set by ASTM International, formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials, and generally include a physical site inspection, a review of relevant federal, state and local environmental and health agency database records, one or more interviews with appropriate site-related personnel, review of the property’s chain of title and review of historical aerial photographs and other information on past uses of the property. These assessments are limited in scope, however, if recommended in the initial assessments, we may undertake additional assessments such as soil and/or groundwater samplings or other limited subsurface investigations and ACM or mold surveys to test for substances of concern. A prior owner or operator of a property or historic operations at our properties may have created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the site assessments. Material environmental conditions may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future, and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability. If environmental concerns are not satisfactorily resolved in any initial or additional assessments, we may obtain environment insurance policies to insure against potential environmental risk or loss depending on the type of property, the availability and cost of the insurance and various other factors we deem relevant (i.e., an environmental occurrence affects one of our properties where our lessee may not have the financial capability to honor its indemnification obligations to us). 
Generally, our leases provide that the lessee will indemnify us for any loss or expense we incur as a result of the presence, use or release of hazardous materials on our property. However, our ultimate liability for environmental conditions may exceed the policy limits on any environmental insurance policies we obtain, if any. If we are unable to enforce the indemnification obligations of our lessees or if the amount of environmental insurance we carry is inadequate, our results of operations would be adversely affected. 
INSURANCE
Our tenants are generally required to maintain liability and property insurance coverage for the properties they lease from us pursuant to triple-net leases. Under such leases, our tenants are generally required to name us (and any of our lenders that have a mortgage on the property leased by the tenant) as additional insureds on their liability policies and additional insured and/or loss payee (or mortgagee, in the case of our lenders) on their property policies. Tenants are required to maintain casualty coverage and most carry limits at 100% of replacement cost. Depending on the location of the property, losses of a catastrophic nature, such as those caused by earthquakes and floods, may be covered by insurance policies that are held by our tenant with limitations such as large deductibles or co-payments that a tenant may not be able to meet. In addition, losses of a catastrophic nature, such as those caused by wind/hail, hurricanes, terrorism or acts of war, may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. In the event there is damage to our properties that is not covered by insurance and such properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we will continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties are irreparably damaged. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Properties - Insurance on our properties may not adequately cover all losses, which could materially and adversely affect us.”
In addition to being generally named as additional insureds on our tenants’ liability policies, we separately maintain commercial general liability coverage with limits of $1.0 million for each occurrence and $2.0 million general aggregate. We also maintain primary property coverage on (i) all unleased properties, (ii) all properties for which such coverage is not required to be carried by a tenant and (iii) all properties for which we obtain such coverage but the costs of which are reimbursed by tenants. In addition, we maintain excess property coverage on all remaining properties and other property coverage as may be required by our lenders.
