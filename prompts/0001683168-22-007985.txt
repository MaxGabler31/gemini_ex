Employees 
 
The management of the Company expects to use consultants, attorneys and accountants as necessary, and does not anticipate a need to engage any full-time employees so long as it is seeking and evaluating business opportunities. The need for employees and their availability will be addressed in connection with the decision whether or not to acquire or participate in specific business opportunities.
Smaller Reporting Company Status
 
We qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $75 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.
