Item 1. | Business

Company 

We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company, or "BDC", under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the “1940 Act.” We have also elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or "RIC", under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the "Code", and we intend to satisfy the Code requirements to receive RIC tax treatment annually. We provide customized financing solutions to small to mid-sized companies. We generally target companies with annual revenues of less than $100 million and annual EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) of less than $15 million. 

We were formed as a Delaware corporation on November 14, 2012. We completed our initial public offering on May 7, 2013. Immediately prior to the initial public offering, we acquired Harvest Capital Credit LLC in a merger whereby the outstanding limited liability company membership interests of Harvest Capital Credit LLC were converted into shares of our common stock and we assumed and succeeded to all of Harvest Capital Credit LLC’s assets and liabilities, including its entire portfolio of investments. Harvest Capital Credit LLC, which was formed in February 2011 and commenced operations in September 2011, was founded by certain members of HCAP Advisors LLC, or “HCAP Advisors,” our investment adviser and administrator, and JMP Group, Inc. (now JMP Group LLC), or “JMP Group.” Harvest Capital Credit LLC is considered to be our predecessor for accounting purposes, and as such, its financial statements are our historical financial statements. 
As used herein, the terms “we”, “us,” and the “Company” refer to Harvest Capital Credit LLC for the periods prior to the initial public offering and refer to Harvest Capital Credit Corporation for the periods after the initial public offering.
Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation primarily by making direct investments in the form of subordinated debt, senior debt, and to a lesser extent, minority equity investments in privately-held U.S. small to mid-sized companies. The companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, our investments in such companies are not rated by any rating agency. If such investments were rated, we believe that they would likely receive a rating below investment grade (i.e., below BBB or Baa), which is often referred to as “junk.” Indebtedness of below investment grade quality is regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. While our primary investment focus is on making loans to, and selected equity investments in, privately-held U.S. small to mid-sized companies, we may also invest in other investments such as loans to larger, publicly-traded companies, high-yield bonds and distressed debt securities. In addition, we may also invest in debt and equity securities issued by collateralized loan obligation funds. 

As a BDC, we are required to comply with numerous regulatory requirements. We are permitted to, and expect to continue to, finance our investments using debt and equity. However, our ability to use debt is limited in certain significant respects. See “Regulation as a Business Development Company.” 
As a RIC, we generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To maintain our RIC treatment, we must meet specified source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90.0% of our ordinary net income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any. See “-Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company.”

Portfolio Composition

As of December 31, 2018, we had $94.9 million (at fair value) invested in 24 companies. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio, at fair value, was comprised of approximately 57.5% senior secured term loans, 35.0% junior secured term loans and 7.5% equity and equity-related investments. As of December 31, 2017, we had $115.6 million (at fair value) invested in 31 companies. As of December 31, 2017, our portfolio included approximately 51.0% of senior secured term loans, 41.6% of junior secured term loans and 7.4% of equity and equity-related investments (including our revenue linked security). 
The weighted average effective yield of our debt and other income producing investments, as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, was approximately 14.8% and 15.3%, respectively. The weighted average effective yield on the entire portfolio, as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, was 12.7% and 13.7%, respectively. The weighted average annualized effective yield on debt and other income-producing investments is computed using the effective interest rates for our debt and other income producing investments, including cash and PIK interest as well as the accretion of deferred fees. The individual investment yields are then weighted by the respective fair values of the investments (as of the date presented) in calculating the weighted average effective yield as a percentage of our debt and other income-producing investments. Infinite Care, LLC was excluded from the calculation as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 because it was on non-accrual status on both dates. Other equity components of the investment portfolio were also excluded from these calculations either because they do not have stated interest rates or are non-income producing.
 The dollar-weighted average annualized yield on the Company’s investments for a given period will generally be higher than what investors in our common stock would realize in a return over the same period because the dollar-weighted average annualized yield does not reflect the Company’s expenses or any sales load that may be paid by investors.
JMP Group

We were founded by certain members of HCAP Advisors, our investment adviser and administrator, and JMP Group, a full-service investment banking and asset management firm. JMP Group currently holds an equity interest in us and a majority equity interest in our investment adviser and administrator. JMP Group conducts its primary business activities through three wholly-owned subsidiaries: (i) Harvest Capital Strategies, LLC, an SEC-registered investment adviser that focuses on long-short equity hedge funds, middle-market lending and private equity, (ii) JMP Securities LLC, a full-service investment bank that provides equity research, institutional brokerage and investment banking services to growth companies and their investors, and (iii) JMP Credit Advisors LLC, or “JMP Credit Advisors,” which manages approximately $1.2 billion in credit assets through its collateralized loan obligation funds. The shares of common stock of JMP Group are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: JMP). JMP Credit Advisors historically acted as our administrator until the administration agreement expired on April 29, 2018, and we entered into an administration agreement with HCAP Advisors. Joseph A. Jolson, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors, is also the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the board of directors of JMP Group.

Investment Adviser

 Our investment adviser’s investment team is led by Joseph A. Jolson (our Chief Executive officer and Chairman of our board of directors), Richard P. Buckanavage (our Managing Director - Head of Business Development), and James Fowler, (our Chief Investment Officer), and is supported by the investment staff at HCAP Advisors, as well as investment professionals from JMP Credit Advisors and JMP Group. In addition, our investment adviser expects to draw upon JMP Group’s over 18-year history in the investment management business and to benefit from the JMP Group investment professionals’ significant capital markets, trading and research expertise developed through investments in different industries and over numerous companies in the United States. 

Our investment adviser has an investment committee that is responsible for approving all key investment decisions that are made by our investment adviser on our behalf. The members of the investment committee are Messrs. Jolson; Buckanavage; Fowler; Carter D. Mack, the President of JMP Group; and Bryan B. Hamm, the President of JMP Credit Advisors. The members of our investment committee have extensive investment experience and collectively currently manage or oversee approximately $2.2 billion of assets, including alternative assets such as long-short equity hedge funds, middle-market lending, private equity, collateralized loan obligation funds, and Harvest Capital Credit Corporation. All key investment decisions made by our investment

adviser on our behalf require approval from three of the five members of the investment committee and must include the approval of Mr. Jolson and Mr. Buckanavage.

Business Strategy

Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation primarily by making direct investments in the form of subordinated debt, senior debt and, to a lesser extent, minority equity investments. We have adopted the following business strategy to achieve our investment objective:

Capitalize on our investment adviser’s extensive relationships with small to mid-sized companies, private equity sponsors and other intermediaries. Our investment adviser maintains extensive relationships with financial intermediaries, entrepreneurs, financial sponsors, management teams, small and mid-sized companies, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, commercial bankers and other non-bank providers of capital throughout the U.S., which we expect will produce attractive investment opportunities for us. Our investment adviser has been the sole or lead originator in a majority of our completed investment transactions. Our investment adviser will also benefit from the resources and relationships of JMP Group, which maintains offices in San Francisco, CA; New York, NY; Chicago, IL; Atlanta, GA; Boston, MA; West Palm Beach, FL; and Minneapolis, MN. 

Leverage the skills of our experienced investment adviser. The principals of our investment adviser have experience advising, investing in and lending to small and mid-sized companies and have been active participants in the primary leveraged credit markets. Throughout their careers, they have navigated various economic cycles as well as several market disruptions. We believe this experience and understanding allows them to select and structure better investments for us and to efficiently monitor and provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies.

Apply disciplined underwriting policies. Lending to small to mid-sized private companies requires in-depth due diligence and credit underwriting expertise, which the principals of our investment adviser have gained throughout their extensive careers. Our investment adviser has implemented disciplined and consistent underwriting policies in every transaction. These policies include a thorough analysis of each potential portfolio company’s competitive position, financial performance, management team, operating discipline, growth potential and industry considerations. 

Maintain rigorous portfolio management. The principals of our investment adviser have significant investing and board-level experience with small to mid-sized companies, and as a result, we expect that our investment adviser will be a value-added partner to, and remain in close contact with, our directly originated portfolio companies. After originating an investment in a company, our investment adviser will monitor each investment closely, typically receiving monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements, meeting face-to-face with our portfolio companies, as well as frequent informal communication with portfolio companies. In addition, our portfolio company investments generally contain financial covenants, and we obtain compliance certificates relating to those covenants quarterly from our portfolio companies. We believe that our investment adviser’s initial and ongoing portfolio review process will allow it to effectively monitor the performance and prospects of our portfolio companies.
“Enterprise value” lending. We and our investment adviser take an enterprise value approach to the loan structuring and underwriting process. “Enterprise value” is the value that a portfolio company’s most recent investors place on the portfolio company or “enterprise.” The value of the enterprise is determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of common stock of the portfolio company outstanding on the date of calculation, on a fully diluted basis (assuming the conversion of all outstanding convertible securities and the exercise of all outstanding options and warrants), by (y) the price per share paid by the most recent purchasers of equity securities of the portfolio company plus the value of the portfolio company's liabilities. We generally secure a subordinated lien or a senior secured lien position against the enterprise value of a portfolio company and we obtain pricing enhancements in the form of warrants and other fees that we expect will build long-term asset appreciation in our portfolio. “Enterprise value” lending requires an in-depth understanding of the companies and markets served. We believe the experience that our investment adviser possesses gives us enhanced capabilities in making these qualitative “enterprise value” evaluations, which we believe can produce a high quality loan portfolio with enhanced returns for our stockholders.
 Opportunity for enhanced returns. To enhance our loan portfolio returns, in addition to receiving interest, we often obtain warrants to purchase the equity of our portfolio companies, as additional consideration for making loans. The warrants we obtain generally include a “cashless exercise” provision to allow us to exercise these rights without requiring us to make any additional cash investment. Obtaining warrants in our portfolio companies allows us to participate in the equity appreciation of our portfolio companies, which we expect will enable us to generate higher returns for our investors. We may also make a direct equity investment in a portfolio company in conjunction with a debt investment, which may provide us with additional equity upside in our investment. 
5

Furthermore, we seek to enhance our loan portfolio returns by obtaining ancillary structuring and other fees related to the origination, investment, disposition or liquidation of debt and investment securities.

Investment Criteria

We use the following criteria and guidelines in evaluating investment opportunities and constructing our portfolio. However, not all of these criteria and guidelines have been, or will be, met in connection with each of our investments.

Value orientation / Positive cash flow. We place a premium on analysis of business fundamentals from an investor’s perspective and have a distinct value orientation. We target companies with proven business models in which we can invest at reasonable multiples of operating cash flow. We also typically invest in companies with a history of profitability. We generally do not invest in start-up companies, “turn-around” situations or companies that we believe have unproven business plans. 

Experienced management teams with meaningful equity ownership. We target portfolio companies that have management teams with significant relevant industry experience coupled with meaningful equity ownership. We believe management teams with these attributes are more likely to manage the companies in a manner that protects our debt investment and enhances the value of our equity investment.

Niche market leaders with defensible market positions. We target companies that have developed defensible and/or leading positions within their respective markets or market niches and are well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities. We favor companies that demonstrate significant competitive advantages, which we believe helps to protect their market position and profitability.

Diversified customer and supplier base. We prefer to invest in companies that have a diversified customer and supplier base. Companies with a diversified customer and supplier base are generally better able to endure economic downturns, industry consolidation and shifting customer preferences.

Limiting portfolio concentration. We seek to avoid concentrated exposure to a particular sector, which serves to diversify our portfolio and help to mitigate the risks of an economic downturn in any particular industry sector. In addition, we seek to diversify our portfolio from a geographic and a single borrower concentration perspective to mitigate the risk of an economic downturn in any particular part of the U.S. or concentration risk with respect to a particular borrower. We have adopted a guideline that we will generally refrain from investing more than 15% of our portfolio in any single industry sector. 

Ability to exert meaningful influence. We seek to target investment opportunities in which we are the lead/sole investor in our tranche and in which we can add value through rigorous portfolio management and exercising certain rights and remedies available to us when necessary.

Private equity sponsorship. When feasible, we seek to invest in companies in conjunction with private equity sponsors who have proven capabilities in building value. We believe that a private equity sponsor can serve as a committed partner and advisor that will actively work with the company and its management team to meet company goals and create value. We assess a private equity sponsor’s commitment to a portfolio company by, among other things, the capital contribution it has made or will make in the portfolio company.

Security interest. We generally seek a first or second priority security interest in all of the portfolio company’s tangible and intangible assets as collateral for our debt investment, subject in some cases to permitted exceptions. Although we do not intend to operate as an asset-based lender, the estimated liquidation value of the assets, if any, collateralizing the debt securities that we hold is evaluated as a potential source of repayment. We evaluate both tangible assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, and intangible assets, such as intellectual property, customer lists, networks and databases.

Covenants. We seek to negotiate covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies with flexibility in managing their businesses, but also act as a tool to minimize our loss of capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or participation rights. Our investments generally have cross-default and material adverse change provisions, require the provision of periodic financial reports and operating metrics, and limit the portfolio company’s ability to incur additional debt, sell assets, engage in transactions with affiliates and consummate an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, acquisition or recapitalization. In addition, we may require other performance or financial based covenants, as we deem appropriate.

6

Exit strategy. We generally seek to invest in companies that we believe possess attributes that will provide us with the ability to exit our investments within a pre-established investment horizon. We expect to exit our investments typically through one of three scenarios: (i) the sale of the company resulting in repayment of all outstanding debt, (ii) the recapitalization of the company through which our loan is replaced with debt or equity from a third party or parties or (iii) the repayment of the initial or remaining principal amount of our loan then outstanding at maturity. In some investments, there may be scheduled amortization of some portion of our loan which would result in a partial exit of our investment prior to the maturity of the loan.

Investment Process

The investment professionals of our investment adviser have responsibility for originating investment opportunities, evaluating potential investments, transaction due diligence, preparation of a preliminary deal evaluation memorandum, negotiation of definitive terms and conditions, securing approval from the investment committee, negotiation of legal documentation and monitoring/management of portfolio investments. There are six key elements of our investment process:
•Origination
•Evaluation
•Structuring/Negotiation
•Due Diligence/Underwriting
•Documentation/Closing
•Portfolio Management/Investment Monitoring.

 Origination

Our investment adviser develops investment opportunities through a relationship network of financial intermediaries, entrepreneurs, financial sponsors, management teams, small- and mid-sized companies, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, commercial bankers and other non-bank providers of capital throughout the U.S. This investment sourcing network has been developed by the principals of our investment adviser, and enabled them to originate investments in every region of the U.S. We believe that the strength of this network should enable our investment adviser to receive the first look at many investment opportunities. We believe that directly originating our own subordinated debt and senior debt investments and equity co-investments gives us greater control over due diligence, structure, terms and ultimately results in stronger investment performance. As a lead and often sole investor in the particular tranche of the capital structure, we also expect to obtain board or observation rights, which allow us to take a more active role in monitoring our investment after we close the investment. 

We also expect our investment adviser’s relationship with JMP Group, which, through Harvest Capital Strategies and JMP Credit Advisors, as applicable, also manages a family of one hedge fund, four private equity and credit funds, one real estate fund, and four collateralized loan obligation funds, to generate investment opportunities for us. From time to time, the Company, subject to the conditions included in the exemptive order we received from the SEC, may co-invest alongside certain accounts and funds affiliated with JMP Group.

Evaluation

An initial review of the potential investment opportunity will be performed by one or more investment professionals of our investment adviser. During the initial review process, the investment professionals may solicit input regarding industry and market dynamics from credit analysts and/or equity research analysts within our investment adviser and JMP Group. If the investment opportunity does not meet our investment criteria, feedback will be delivered timely through our origination channels. To the extent an investment appears to meet our investment criteria, the investment professionals of our investment adviser will begin preliminary due diligence.

Structuring/Negotiation

When an investment professional of our investment adviser identifies an investment opportunity that appears to meet our investment criteria, one or more of our investment adviser’s investment professionals will prepare a pre-screen memorandum. During the process, comprehensive and proprietary models are created to evaluate a range of outcomes based on sensitized variables including various economic environments, changes in the cost of production, and various product or service supply/demand and pricing scenarios. The investment professionals of our investment adviser will perform preliminary due diligence and tailor a capital structure to match the historical financial performance and growth strategy of the potential portfolio company.

7

The pre-screen memorandum will also include the following:
•Transaction description;

• | Company description, including product or service analysis, market position, industry dynamics, customer and supplier analysis, and management evaluation;


• | Quantitative and qualitative analysis of historical financial performance and preparation of 5-year financial projections;

•Competitive landscape;
•Business strengths and weaknesses;
•Quantitative and qualitative analysis of business owner(s) (including private equity firm);
•Potential investment structure, leverage multiples and expected yield calculations; and
•Outline of key due diligence areas.

The investment committee of our investment adviser then reviews the pre-screen memorandum and determines whether the opportunity fits our general investment criteria and should be considered for further due diligence. If the investment committee makes a positive determination, the investment professionals of our investment adviser will then negotiate and execute a non-binding term sheet with the potential portfolio company and conduct further due diligence.

The investment committee of our investment adviser currently consists of Messrs. Jolson, Buckanavage, Fowler, Mack and Hamm. All key decisions, including screening, initial approvals, final commitment, material amendments and sale approvals (if applicable), require approvals from three of the five investment committee members and must include approval from Mr. Jolson and Mr. Buckanavage. Although we have a formal process for investment approvals, the investment professionals of our investment adviser regularly communicate with at least one member of the investment committee throughout the investment transaction process to ensure efficiency as well as clarity for our prospective portfolio companies and clients.

Due Diligence/Underwriting

Once a non-binding term sheet has been negotiated and executed with the potential portfolio company and, in limited circumstances, the prospective portfolio company has remitted a good faith deposit, we begin our formal underwriting and due diligence process by requesting additional due diligence materials from the prospective portfolio company and arranging additional on-site visits with management and relevant employees. Our investment adviser typically requests the following information as part of the due diligence process: 

• | annual and interim (including monthly) financial information;


• | completion of a quality of earnings assessment by an accounting firm;


• | capitalization tables showing details of equity capital raised and ownership;


• | recent presentations to investors or board members covering the portfolio company’s current status and market opportunity;


• | detailed business plan, including an executive summary and discussion of market opportunity;


• | detailed background on all senior members of management, including background checks by third party;


• | detailed forecast for the current and subsequent five fiscal years;


• | information on competitors and the prospective portfolio company’s competitive advantage;


• | completion of Phase I (and, if necessary, Phase II) environmental assessment;


• | marketing information on the prospective portfolio company’s products, if any;


• | information on the prospective portfolio company’s intellectual property; and


• | information on the prospective portfolio company from its key customers or clients.


The due diligence process includes a formal visit to the prospective portfolio company’s location and interviews with the prospective portfolio company’s senior management team and key operational employees. Outside sources of information are reviewed, including industry publications, market articles, Internet publications, or publicly available information on competitors.

Documentation/Closing

Upon completion of the due diligence process and review and analysis of all of the information provided by the prospective portfolio company and obtained externally, the investment professionals assigned to the opportunity prepare an investment memorandum for review and approval. The investment committee of our investment adviser will reconvene to evaluate the opportunity, review the investment memorandum and discuss the findings of the due diligence process. If the opportunity receives 
8

final approval, the principals of our investment adviser, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, will be responsible for preparing and negotiating transaction documents and ensuring that the documents accurately reflect the terms and conditions approved by the investment committee. Funding requires final approval by three of the five investment committee members and must include approval from Mr. Jolson and Mr. Buckanavage.

Portfolio Management/Investment Monitoring

Our investment adviser employs several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance of our portfolio companies, which, depending on the particular investment, may include the following processes, procedures, and reports:

• | Review of available monthly or quarterly financial statements compared against the prior year’s comparable period and the company’s financial projections;


• | Review and discussion, if applicable, of the management discussion and analysis that will accompany its financial results;


• | Review of the company’s quarterly results and overall general business performance and assessment of the company’s compliance with all covenants (financial or otherwise), including preparation of a portfolio monitoring report or “PMR” (on a quarterly basis), which will be distributed to the members of the investment committee of our investment adviser; 


• | Periodic, and often, face-to-face meetings with management team and owners (including private equity firm if applicable); and


• | Attendance at board of directors meetings at portfolio companies through formal board seat or board observation rights.


Once the investment adviser has had the opportunity to review all quarterly PMRs, a meeting will be held with the investment professionals to review all of the PMRs to ensure consensus on risk rating, action steps (if any), and valuation.

In connection with the preparation of PMRs, each investment receives a quarterly risk rating following the five-level numeric investment rating outlined below:

Investment Rating | Summary Description 
1 | Investment Rating 1 is used for investments that are performing above expectations, and whose risks remain favorable compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. 
2 | Investment Rating 2 is used for investments that are performing within expectations and whose risks remain neutral compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. All new loans are initially rated 2. 
3 | Investment Rating 3 is used for investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of return or principal is expected. Portfolio companies with a rating of 3 may be out of compliance with financial covenants. 
4 | Investment Rating 4 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are often in workout. Investments with a rating of 4 are those for which there is an increased possibility of some loss of return but no loss of principal is expected.
5 | Investment Rating 5 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are almost always in workout. Investments with a rating of 5 are those for which some loss of return and principal is expected. 

Determination of Net Asset Value and Portfolio Valuation Process 

The net asset value per share of our common stock will be determined quarterly by dividing the value of our total assets minus liabilities by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding at the date as of which the determination is made. We will conduct the valuation of our assets, pursuant to which our net asset value will be determined, at all times consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or “GAAP,” and the 1940 Act.

In calculating the fair value of our total assets, investments for which market quotations are readily available will be valued at such market quotations, which will generally be obtained from an independent pricing service or one or more broker-dealers or market makers. 

9

We expect that there will not be a readily available market value for a substantial portion of our portfolio investments, and we will value those debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market value is not ascertainable at fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors pursuant to a valuation policy that is in accordance with GAAP and the 1940 Act and pursuant to a valuation process approved by our board of directors. Our investment adviser also employs an independent third party valuation firm to assist in determining fair value.

In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, and with the assistance of any third-party valuation firms that we employ, we perform detailed valuations of our debt and equity investments on an individual basis, using market, income, and bond yield approaches as appropriate. In general, we utilize a bond yield method for the majority of our debt investments, as long as it is appropriate. If, in our judgment, the bond yield approach is not appropriate, we may use the market approach, or, in certain cases, an alternative methodology potentially including an asset liquidation or expected recovery model. For our equity investments, we generally utilize the market and income approaches. 

Under the bond yield approach, we use bond yield models to determine the present value of the future cash flow streams of our debt investments. We review various sources of transactional data, including private mergers and acquisitions involving debt investments with similar characteristics, and assess the information to benchmark appropriate discount rates in the valuation process.

Under the market approach, we estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio companies in which we invest. There is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value, and in fact, for any one portfolio company, enterprise value is best expressed as a range of fair values, from which we derive a single estimate of enterprise value. To estimate the enterprise value of a portfolio company, we analyze various factors, including the portfolio company’s historical and projected financial results. Typically, private companies are valued based on multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited cases, book value. We generally require portfolio companies to provide annual audited and quarterly and monthly unaudited financial statements, as well as annual projections for the upcoming fiscal year, though in some cases we have waived, and in the future may determine to waive, the requirement to provide audited financial statements based on facts and circumstances that make the portfolio company's audit impracticable.

Under the income approach, we generally prepare and analyze discounted cash flow models based on projections of the future free cash flows of the business. The discount rates used are determined based upon the portfolio company's weighted average cost of capital.

The types of factors that the board of directors may take into account in determining fair value include comparisons of financial ratios of the portfolio companies that issued such private equity securities to peer companies that are public, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the company will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation.

The following is a description of our valuation process. Investments are measured at fair value as determined in good faith by our management team, reviewed by the audit committee of the board of directors (independent directors), and ultimately approved by our board of directors, based on, among other factors, consistently applied valuation procedures on each measurement date.
The board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process at each measurement date:
• Our valuation process generally begins with each investment initially being valued by the Company's management or the investment professionals of our investment adviser, and/or, if applicable, by an independent valuation firm.
• Preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with our senior management.
• The audit committee of our board of directors reviews and discusses the preliminary valuations.
• The board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based upon the input of our senior management, the independent valuation firm report (if reviewed in such quarter), and the audit committee.
10

The nature of the materials and input that the Company’s board of directors receives in the valuation process varies depending on the nature of the investment and the other facts and circumstances. For example, in the case of investments that are Level 1 or 2 assets, a formal report by the Company’s management or the investment professionals of its investment adviser, called a portfolio monitoring report, or “PMR,” is not generally prepared, and no independent external valuation firm is engaged due to the availability of quotes in markets for such investments or similar assets. In the case of investments that are Level 3 assets, however, the Company’s board of directors generally receives a report on material Level 3 investments on a quarterly basis (i) from the Company’s management or the investment professionals of its investment adviser in the form of a PMR, (ii) from a third-party valuation firm, or (iii) in some cases, both. In the case of investments that are Level 3 assets and have an investment rating of 1 (performing above expectations), the Company generally engages an independent external valuation firm to review all such material investments at least annually. In quarters where an external valuation is not prepared for such investments, the Company’s management or the investment professionals of our investment adviser generally prepare a PMR. In the case of investments that are Level 3 assets and have an investment rating of 2 through 5 (with performance ranging from within expectations to substantially below expectations), the Company generally engages an independent external valuation firm to review such material investments quarterly (and may receive a PMR in addition to the review of the independent external valuation firm where the Level 3 assets have an investment rating of 3 through 5). However, in certain cases for Level 3 assets, the Company may determine that it is more appropriate for the Company to prepare a PMR instead of engaging an independent external valuation firm on a quarterly basis, because a third-party valuation is not cost effective or the nature of the investment does not warrant a quarterly third-party valuation. In addition, under certain unique circumstances, the Company may determine that a formal valuation report is not likely to be informative, and neither a third-party valuation report nor a report from the Company’s management or the investment professionals of its investment adviser is prepared. Such circumstances might include, for example, an instance in which the investment has paid off after the period end date but before the board of directors meets to discuss the valuations. Further, Level 3 debt investments that have closed within six months of the measurement date are valued at cost unless unique circumstances dictate otherwise.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily observable fair value, and the subjective judgments and estimates involved in those determinations, the fair value determinations by our board of directors, even though determined in good faith, may differ materially from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.

Derivatives

We may utilize hedging techniques such as entering into interest rate swaps to mitigate potential interest rate risk on our indebtedness. Such interest rate swaps would principally be used to protect us against higher costs on our indebtedness resulting from increases in both short-term and long-term interest rates.

We also may use various hedging and other risk management strategies to seek to manage various risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Such hedging strategies would be utilized to seek to protect the value of our portfolio investments, for example, against possible adverse changes in the market value of securities held in our portfolio.

Managerial Assistance

As a BDC, we offer, through our investment adviser, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies. This assistance may involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of these portfolio companies, participating in board of directors and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance.

We may receive fees for these services, though we may reimburse our investment adviser for its expenses related to providing such services on our behalf.

Competition

We compete for investments with other BDCs and investment funds, as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other financing sources. A number of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or that the Code imposes on us as a RIC. We believe we compete effectively with these entities primarily on the basis of the experience, industry knowledge and contacts of the principals of our investment adviser, its responsiveness and efficient investment analysis and decision-making processes, its creative financing products and highly 
11

customized investment terms. We do not intend to compete primarily on the interest rates we offer and believe that some competitors make loans with rates that are comparable or lower than our rates.
Employees

We do not have any employees. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by our investment adviser, and each of our officers is an employee of our investment adviser or other affiliate. As of March 14, 2019, our investment adviser employed a total of seven full-time employees, who expect to draw upon the resources of JMP Group, including its investment professionals as well as finance and operational professionals, in connection with our investment activities. In addition, we reimburse our administrator, HCAP Advisors, for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including the compensation of our executive officers and their respective staffs. For a more detailed discussion of the administration agreement with HCAP Advisors, see “Administration Agreement.” As previously disclosed, during 2018 we transitioned the provision of administrative services to the Company from JMP Credit Advisors to HCAP Advisors, our investment adviser. 
Investment Advisory Agreement

HCAP Advisors serves as our investment adviser pursuant to an investment advisory and management agreement. Our investment adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or the "Advisers Act". Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, HCAP Advisors manages our day-to-day operations, and provides investment advisory and management services to us.

 Under the terms of our investment advisory and management agreement, HCAP Advisors:

• | identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies);


• | determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; and


• | closes, monitors and administers the investments we make, including the exercise of any voting or consent rights.


HCAP Advisors’ services under the investment advisory and management agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. Under the investment advisory and management agreement, HCAP Advisors also provides on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance.

Management Fee

Pursuant to our investment advisory and management agreement, we pay HCAP Advisors a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of a base management fee and a two-part incentive fee. 

 Base Management Fee. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2.0% on our gross assets up to and including $350 million, 1.75% on gross assets above $350 million and up to and including $1 billion, and 1.5% on gross assets above $1 billion, and is payable quarterly in arrears. For purposes of calculating the base management fee, the term “gross assets” includes all assets, including any assets acquired with the proceeds of leverage, but excludes cash and cash equivalents. Our investment adviser benefits when we incur debt or use leverage. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. Base management fees for any partial quarter will be appropriately prorated. 

Incentive Fee. The incentive fee has two parts, as follows:

One component is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter and is 20% of the amount, if any, by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds a 2.0% (which is 8.0% annualized) hurdle rate and a “catch-up” provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter. Under this provision, in any calendar quarter, our investment adviser receives no incentive fee until our net investment income equals the hurdle rate of 2.0%, but then receives, as a “catch-up”, 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that 
12

exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5%. The effect of this provision is that, if pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter, our investment adviser will receive 20% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement (as defined below), and any interest expense and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Since the hurdle rate is fixed, as interest rates rise, it is easier for our investment adviser to surpass the hurdle rate and receive an incentive fee based on net investment income. The foregoing incentive fee is subject to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income will be payable except to the extent 20% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding quarters exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding quarters. In other words, any ordinary income incentive fee that is payable in a calendar quarter is limited to the lesser of (i) 20% of the amount by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the 2% hurdle, subject to the “catch-up” provision, and (ii) (x) 20% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters minus (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding calendar quarters. For the foregoing purpose, the “cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations” is the amount, if positive, of the sum of pre-incentive fee net investment income, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation of the Company for the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters.

Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss. For example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. Our net investment income used to calculate this component of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the base management fee. These calculations are appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter. 

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee:

Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Net Investment Income

Pre-incentive Fee Net Investment Income
(expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets)


Percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Allocated to First Component of Incentive Fee

The second component of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment advisory and management agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20.0% of our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation (unrealized depreciation on a gross investment-by-investment basis at the end of each calendar year). If the difference is positive, then the capital gains incentive fee is 20.0% of such amount, as noted above, less the aggregate amount of performance-based capital gains incentive fee payments previously made to our investment adviser.

Examples of Incentive Fee Calculation

Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee before Total Return Requirement Calculation: 

Assumptions
•Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0%
•Management fee(2) = 0.50%
•Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, etc.)(3) = 0.20%
Alternative 1
Additional Assumptions
•Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25%

• | Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.55%

Pre-incentive net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate; therefore there is no incentive fee.

Alternative 2
Additional Assumptions
•Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.0%
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.30%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds hurdle rate; therefore there is an incentive fee.

• | Incentive fee = (100% x “Catch-Up”) + (the greater of 0% AND (20% x (pre-incentive fee net investment income – 2.5%)))


= | (100.0% x (pre-incentive fee net investment income – 2.0%)) + 0%
= | (100.0% x (2.30% – 2.0%)) 
= | 100.0% x 0.30% 
= | 0.30% 

Alternative 3
Additional Assumptions
•Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.50%

• | Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.8%


• | Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds hurdle rate; therefore there is an incentive fee.

Incentive Fee = (100% x “Catch-Up”) + (the greater of 0% AND (20% x (pre-incentive fee net investment income – 2.5%)))

= | (100% x (2.5% – 2.0%)) + (20% x (2.8% – 2.5%))
= | 0.50% + (20% x 0.3%) 
= | 0.50% + 0.06% 
= | 0.56% 

14


(1) | Represents 8.0% annualized hurdle rate. 
(2) | Represents 2.00% annualized management fee based on the assumption that our gross assets are not above $350 million. The annual rate at which our management fee is calculated is dependent upon the size of our gross assets, with the management fee being 2.0% on our gross assets up to and including $350 million, 1.75% on gross assets above $350 million and up to and including $1 billion, and 1.5% on gross assets above $1 billion.
(3) | Excludes organizational and offering expenses. 

Example 2: Income Portion of Incentive Fee with Total Return Requirement Calculation: 

Alternative 1: 
Assumptions 

• | Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.50%


◦ | Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0%


◦ | Management fee(2) = 0.50%


◦ | Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, etc.)(3) = 0.20%


• | Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income – (management fee + other expenses) = 2.80%


• | Cumulative incentive compensation accrued and/or paid for preceding 11 calendar quarters = $9,000,000


• | 20% of cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over current and preceding 11 calendar quarters = $8,000,000


Although our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate of 2.0% (as shown in Alternative 3 of Example 1 above), no incentive fee is payable because 20% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters did not exceed the cumulative income and capital gains incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the preceding 11 calendar quarters. 

Alternative 2: 
Assumptions 

• | Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.50%


◦ | Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0%


◦ | Management fee(2) = 0.50%


◦ | Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20%


◦ | Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income – (management fee + other expenses) = 2.80%


◦ | Cumulative incentive compensation accrued and/or paid for preceding 11 calendar quarters = $9,000,000


◦ | 20.0% of cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over current and preceding 11 calendar quarters = $10,000,000

Because our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate of 2.0% and because 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters exceeds the cumulative income and capital gains incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the preceding 11 calendar quarters, an incentive fee would be payable, as shown in Alternative 3 of Example 1 above.

(1) | Represents 8.0% annualized hurdle rate. 
(2) | Represents 2.00% annualized base management fee based on the assumption that our gross assets are not above $350 million. The annual rate at which our management fee is calculated is dependent upon the size of our gross assets, with the management fee being 2.0% on our gross assets up to and including $350 million, 1.75% on gross assets above $350 million and up to and including $1 billion, and 1.5% on gross assets above $1 billion.
(3) | Excludes organizational and offering expenses. 
(4) | The “catch-up” provision is intended to provide our investment adviser with an incentive fee of 20% on all pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any fiscal quarter. 

Example 3: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee: 

Alternative 1:
Assumptions

• | Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), and $30 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”)


• | Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million and fair market value, or FMV, of Investment B determined to be $32 million


• | Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million


• | Year 4: Investment B sold for $31 million

The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be:

• | Year 1: None


• | Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $6.0 million ($30 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20.0%)


• | Year 3: None; $5.0 million (20% multiplied by ($30 million cumulative capital gains less $5 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $6.0 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2)


• | Year 4: Capital gains incentive fee of $200,000; $6.2 million ($31 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20%) less $6.0 million (capital gains fee paid in Year 2)

Alternative 2
Assumptions

• | Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), $30 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”) and $25 million investment made in Company C (“Investment C”)


• | Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $25 million


• | Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $27 million and Investment C sold for $30 million


• | Year 4: FMV of Investment B determined to be $24 million


• | Year 5: Investment B sold for $20 million

The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be:

• | Year 1: None


• | Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $5.0 million; 20% multiplied by $25 million ($30 million realized capital gains on Investment A less $5 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B)

16


• | Year 3: Capital gains incentive fee of $1.4 million; $6.4 million (20% multiplied by $32 million ($35 million cumulative realized capital gains less $3 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B)) less $5.0 million capital gains fee received in Year 2


• | Year 4: None


• | Year 5: None; $5.0 million of capital gains incentive fee (20% multiplied by $25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $35 million less realized capital losses of $10 million)) less $6.4 million cumulative capital gains fee paid in Year 2 and Year 3

Duration and Termination
Our board of directors approved the investment advisory and management agreement at its first meeting, held on January 17, 2013. The investment advisory and management agreement was originally executed as of April 29, 2013 for an initial term of two years. Subsequent one-year renewals have been approved by our board of directors per the table below. 

 | Effective 
Approval date | From | To 
January 17, 2013 | April 29, 2013 | April 29, 2015
March 5, 2015 | April 29, 2015 | April 29, 2016
March 8, 2016 | April 29, 2016 | April 29, 2017

March 8, 2019 | April 29, 2019 | April 30, 2020

Unless earlier terminated as described below, the investment advisory and management agreement provides that it will remain in effect if approved annually by our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not parties to such agreement or who are not “interested persons” of any such party, as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. The investment advisory and management agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The investment advisory and management agreement may also be terminated by either party without penalty upon not more than 60 days’ written notice to the other party. See “Risk Factors - Our investment adviser has the right to resign on 60 days’ notice, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.”
Board Approval of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement
Our board of directors determined at an in-person meeting held on March 7 and 8, 2019, to re-approve our investment advisory and management agreement with our investment adviser. In its consideration of the investment advisory and management agreement, the board of directors focused on information it had received relating to, among other things:

• | the nature, extent, and quality of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by our investment adviser, including, without limitation, in relation to the origination and underwriting of investments in middle market and lower middle market private companies and information with respect to our investment adviser’s portfolio management process;


• | the performance of the Company and our investment adviser, including, without limitation, comparative data with respect to the performance of BDCs with similar investment objectives;


• | comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other BDCs with similar investment objectives, as well as other externally managed BDCs;


• | our operating expenses and expense ratio compared to BDCs with similar investment objectives, including, without limitation, consideration of administrative fees paid by other BDCs with similar investment objectives, as well as other externally managed BDCs, given HCAP Advisors’ provision of administrative services to the Company under the administration agreement and receipt of administrative fees for such services;

18


• | any existing and potential sources of indirect income to our investment adviser from its relationships with us and the profitability of those relationships, including, without limitation, administrative fees paid to HCAP Advisors in its capacity as the administrator under the administration agreement with the Company;


• | information about the services to be performed, the cost of such services, and the personnel performing such services under the investment advisory and management agreement, including, without limitation, the experience of such personnel in originating investments in the middle market and lower middle market;


• | the organizational capability and financial condition of our investment adviser;


• | the extent to which economies of scale would be realized if the Company grows and whether fee levels reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of the Company's stockholders, including, without limitation, consideration that the investment advisory and management agreement includes breakpoints that provide for the reduction of the base management fee as the Company’s gross assets increase above certain thresholds; and


• | such other matters as the board of directors determined were relevant to their consideration of the investment advisory and management agreement.

In connection with their consideration of the renewal of the investment advisory and management agreement, our board of directors gave weight to each of the factors described above, but did not identify one particular factor as controlling their decision. Based on the information reviewed and the discussions, the board of directors, including a majority of the directors who are not “interested persons” as defined in the 1940 Act, concluded that the investment management fee rates are reasonable in relation to the services to be provided and approved the renewal of the investment advisory and management agreement.
Organization of the Investment Adviser

HCAP Advisors is a Delaware limited liability company. The principal executive offices of HCAP Advisors are located at 767 Third Avenue, 29th Floor, New York, New York 10017.

Administration Agreement

HCAP Advisors currently serves as our administrator, pursuant to an administration agreement, which became effective on April 29, 2018. Prior to April 29, 2018, JMP Credit Advisors served as our administrator. Pursuant to the aforementioned administration agreement, HCAP Advisors furnishes us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities. Under the administration agreement, the administrator also performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include, among other things, being responsible for the financial records which we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders. In addition, the administrator assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Payments under the administration agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of the administrator’s overhead in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the cost of our executive officers and their respective staffs.
Our board of directors or a committee thereof discusses with our administrator the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us. Our board of directors or a committee thereof also assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services. In addition, our board of directors or a committee thereof consider other factors in assessing the reasonableness of the fee, including the amounts paid for such services by other BDCs and the costs that may be associated with obtaining similar services from other third-party service providers.
On March 8, 2016, we negotiated a cap with JMP Credit Advisors on amounts payable by us under the administration agreement during the 2016 fiscal and calendar year.  This cap set the maximum amount that would be payable by us for 2016 at the lesser of 0.60% of the average of our total investments (at fair value) over the year ended December 31, 2016 or $917,000. On January 4, 2017, our board of directors approved an increase in the cap to the extent necessary to reimburse JMP Credit Advisors for the cost of administrative services provided to the Company by Chief Executive Officer Richard P. Buckanavage and Vice President Ryan T. Magee in the fourth quarter of 2016, in an amount up to $75,000. 
On March 10, 2017, we negotiated a new cap with JMP Credit Advisors on amounts payable by us under the administration agreement during the 2017 fiscal and calendar year.  This cap set the maximum amount that would be payable by us for 2017 at $1.2 million. On October 27, 2017, our compensation committee and board of directors approved an increase in the cap on amounts payable by the Company under the administration agreement to cover increased costs associated with moving our administrative functions from Alpharetta, Georgia to its headquarters in New York, New York.  In particular, our compensation committee and board of directors approved an increase in this cap to the extent necessary to reimburse JMP Credit Advisors for costs and expenses payable by us under the administration agreement for fiscal year 2017 in excess of the existing cap, up to an additional $0.2 million, for a total cap on all amounts to be paid by the Company under the administration agreement for fiscal year 2017 of $1.4 million. 
On April 17, 2018, we negotiated a new cap with HCAP Advisors on amounts payable by us under the administration agreement during the 2018 fiscal and calendar year. This cap set the maximum amount that would be payable by us for 2018 at $1.4 million. 
The existence of a cap, and the determination of a proper cap amount, in subsequent years will be determined by the mutual agreement of the independent members of our board of directors, on our behalf, and the administrator. The administration agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other. 

The administration agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, HCAP Advisors and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of the administrator’s services under the administration agreement or otherwise as administrator for us. 
License Agreement

19

We have entered into a license agreement with an affiliate of JMP Group pursuant to which it has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name “Harvest.” Under this agreement, we have a right to use the “Harvest” name for so long as an affiliate of JMP Group remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the “Harvest” name. 
Regulation as a BDC

We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by “a majority of our outstanding voting securities” as defined in the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of such company’s shares present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company are present and represented by proxy or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company. Our bylaws provide for the calling of a special meeting of stockholders at which such action could be considered upon written notice of not less than ten or more than sixty days before the date of such meeting.

We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company (i.e., mutual fund, registered closed-end fund or BDC) that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses.

We are also prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our board of directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. For example, under the 1940 Act, absent receipt of exemptive relief from the SEC, we and our affiliates are generally precluded from co-investing in private placements of securities. However, on December 10, 2015, we received exemptive relief from the SEC permitting us greater flexibility to negotiate the terms of co-investments with investment funds managed by HCAP Advisors or JMP Credit Advisors and with certain accounts managed or held by JMP Group and certain of its subsidiaries, in each case in a manner consistent with our investment objectives and strategies as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors (including the terms and conditions of the exemptive order issued by the SEC). Under the terms of the relief, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) that the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objectives and strategies. We intend to co-invest, subject to the conditions included in the exemptive order we received from the SEC, with investment funds managed by HCAP Advisors or JMP Credit Advisors and with certain accounts managed or held by JMP Group and certain of its subsidiaries. We believe that such co-investments may afford us additional investment opportunities.

We expect to be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.

We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.

We and our investment adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. We and our investment adviser have designated a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering these policies and procedures.

Qualifying assets

Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following:
20


• | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:


◦ | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;


◦ | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and


◦ | satisfies any of the following:


▪ | is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million;


▪ | is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC, the BDC actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result thereof, the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or


▪ | has a market capitalization of less than $250 million or does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange.


• | Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control.


• | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by us) or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.


• | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.


• | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.


• | Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.


The regulations defining qualifying assets may change over time. We may adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area.

Managerial assistance to portfolio companies

A BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in “— Qualifying assets” above. BDCs generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the BDC controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers, employees or agents, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.

Issuance of Additional Shares of our Common Stock

We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, issue and sell our common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interest and in the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders have approved our policy and practice of making such sales within the preceding 12 months. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities.
21

Temporary investments

Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we invest in highly rated commercial paper, U.S. government agency notes, U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements relating to such securities that are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. Government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to maintain our qualification as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our investment adviser monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.

Senior securities; Derivative securities

We are permitted, under specified conditions and subject to certain exceptions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. Legislation enacted in 2018, however, would allow us to incur additional leverage if we obtain certain approvals from our independent directors and/or our stockholders to reduce our asset coverage ratio from 200% to 150%. On May 4, 2018, our board of directors unanimously approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as modified by the Small Business Credit Availability Act. As a result, the asset coverage ratio applicable to the Company will be changed from 200% to 150%, effective May 4, 2019. At that time, we would be permitted under the 1940 Act to increase our leverage up to an amount that reduces our asset coverage ratio from 200% to 150%, but we would still have to comply with or amend any then-existing provisions of our revolving credit facility that limit our ability to incur such additional leverage. Under our existing revolving credit facility, for example, our debt-to-tangible equity ratio is limited to 1.00 to 1.00. See "Risk Factors--Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure-- Regulations governing our operations and capital structure affect (and could limit) our ability to raise, and the way in which we may raise, additional capital. Changes to these regulations passed in 2018 will allow us to increase our leverage." We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage.

The 1940 Act also limits the amount of warrants, options and rights to common stock that we may issue and the terms of such securities.

Code of ethics

We and our investment adviser have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, respectively, that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. In addition, each code of ethics is available on the EDGAR database on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. Our code of ethics is also available on our corporate governance webpage of http://www.harvestcapitalcredit.com/corporate-governance.

Proxy voting policies and procedures

We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility, with respect to our portfolio companies, to our investment adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of our investment adviser are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by our investment adviser and our independent directors and, accordingly, are subject to change.

Introduction

Our investment adviser is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, our investment adviser has fiduciary duties to us. As part of this duty, our investment adviser recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. Our investment adviser’s Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures have been formulated to ensure decision-making consistent with these fiduciary duties.
22


These policies and procedures for voting proxies are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.

Proxy policies

Our investment adviser votes proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what our investment adviser perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders. Our investment adviser reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its effect on the portfolio securities held by us. Although our investment adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative effect on our portfolio securities, our investment adviser may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so.

Our investment adviser’s proxy voting decisions are made by those senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our investments. To ensure that a vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, our investment adviser requires that (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to our chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. If a vote may involve a material conflict of interest, prior to approving such vote, our investment adviser must consult with our chief compliance officer to determine whether the potential conflict is material and if so, the appropriate method to resolve such conflict. If the conflict is determined not to be material, our investment adviser’s employees shall vote the proxy in accordance with our investment adviser’s proxy voting policy. 

Proxy voting records

You may obtain information about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to Chief Compliance Officer, Harvest Capital Credit Corporation, 767 Third Avenue, 29th Floor, New York, New York 10017. 

Privacy Principles

We are committed to maintaining the privacy of stockholders and to safeguarding our non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties.

Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain non-public personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third party administrator).

We restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to our investment adviser’s and administrator’s employees with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders. 
Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company 

We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to be able to deduct the amount of our distributions, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our net ordinary taxable income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”). 

For any taxable year in which we: 

23

 • qualify as a RIC; and 
 • satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement,

we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain, defined as net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses, we distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any net income or net capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 
We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no corporate-level U.S. federal income tax (the “Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement”). We generally will endeavor in each taxable year to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to avoid any U.S. federal excise tax on our earnings. In this regard, the Company does not expect to incur an excise tax for the year ended December 31, 2018.
In order to maintain our qualification as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 

• | continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;


• | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities (the “90% Income Test”); and


• | diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:


• | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and


• | no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (the “Diversification Tests”).


We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest and deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock, or certain income with respect to foreign corporations. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 

We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy the distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted in certain circumstances to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If we are prohibited from making distributions or are unable to obtain cash from other sources to make the distributions, we may fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, which would result in us becoming subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax.
24


In accordance with certain applicable Treasury regulations and a revenue procedure issued by the Internal Revenue Service, a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many stockholders elect to receive cash, the cash available for distribution must be allocated among each stockholder electing to receive cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any stockholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than the lesser of (a) the portion of the distribution such shareholder has elected to receive in cash, or (b) an amount equal to his or her entire distribution times the percentage limitation on cash available for distribution. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying distributions in shares of our stock in accordance with these Treasury regulations or revenue procedure.
Our Status as an Emerging Growth Company

At our IPO, we elected to be an "emerging growth company", or “EGC,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the “JOBS Act.” An EGC is defined as a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion in its most recently completed fiscal year. An EGC will retain such status until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date it first sold securities pursuant to an initial public offering registration statement; (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which it first exceeds $1.07 billion in annual gross revenues; (3) the time it becomes a large accelerated filer (an SEC registered company with a public float of at least $700 million); or (4) the date on which the EGC has, within the previous three years, issued $1 billion of nonconvertible debt.

The JOBS Act affords an EGC an opportunity to get a temporary reprieve from certain SEC regulations by exempting an EGC from these regulations for up to five years. These eased requirements include an exemption from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements and relaxed restrictions on the sale of securities. The JOBS Act provides scaled disclosure provisions for EGCs, including, among other things, removing the requirement that EGCs comply with Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b) auditor attestation of internal control over financial reporting.

Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act also permits an EGC to elect an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until such time as these new or revised standards are made applicable to all private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us since our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
Effective December, 31, 2018, we lost our EGC status, as this marked the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering. Losing our EGC status did not have an adverse impact on our financial condition, business, or results of operations.
The NASDAQ Stock Market Corporate Governance Regulations 

The NASDAQ Stock Market has adopted corporate governance regulations that listed companies must comply with. We are in compliance with such corporate governance listing standards applicable to BDCs.
