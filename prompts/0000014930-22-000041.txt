Item 1. Business
References to "we," "us," "our," the "Company," "Brunswick," and "Brunswick Corporation" refer to Brunswick Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context specifically states or implies otherwise.
We design, manufacture, and market recreational marine products, including leading marine propulsion products and boats, as well as parts and accessories for the marine and RV markets, and we operate the world's largest boat club. Our commitment to developing the next generation of marine and recreational experiences, technologies, and connections is backed up by a long history of quality and innovation. Incorporated in Delaware on December 31, 1907, Brunswick has traded on the New York Stock Exchange for more than 95 years. 
As the global leader in recreational marine, it is our intention to define the future of recreation through innovation and inspiration on the water. Our strategy is focused on: 
•Understanding and addressing the changing needs and behaviors of global boating participants;
•Investing in innovative, global product leadership and leveraging our leading brands to meet consumer needs;
•Delivering distinctive, elevated ownership and shared-access experiences that expand boating participation;
•Investing in increasing global business resiliency;
•Being the partner of choice to our customers by offering leading, integrated technical and business solutions;
•Leading the industry in Autonomy, Connectivity, Electrification, and Shared Access (ACES) strategies, including with our portfolio of electrified solutions;
•Unlocking unique and profound enterprise synergies;
•Engaging consumers with the richest, most intuitive digital experiences;
•Being an acknowledged marine industry leader in sustainability; and
•Being an employer of choice through our clear purpose and culture of inclusiveness.
These strategies support our aim to create exceptional experiences for customers, expand participation in recreational boating, deliver industry transforming technology, and leverage our leading businesses to grow earnings and enhance shareholder value. Our integrated business strategy is supported by a balanced capital strategy that includes allocating capital to organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisition opportunities while also managing debt levels and maturities, maintaining strong cash and liquidity positions, and continuing to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
We have three reportable segments: Propulsion, Parts & Accessories (P&A), and Boat. The Propulsion segment manufactures and markets a full range of outboard, sterndrive, and inboard engines, as well as propulsion-related controls, rigging, and propellers. The P&A segment includes engine parts and consumables, such as oils and lubricants, electrical products, boat parts and systems, and our distribution business. The Boat segment manufactures and distributes recreational boats, including sport boats and cruisers, runabouts, fiberglass offshore boats and fishing boats, aluminum fishing, utility, pontoon and deck boats, tow/wake boats, and heavy-gauge aluminum boats. The Boat segment also includes Business Acceleration, which operates Freedom Boat Club, dealer financing and ancillary services, and develops other emerging marine business models.

Propulsion Segment
The Propulsion segment, which we believe is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of recreational marine engines and propulsion systems, had net sales of $2,504.7 million in 2021. The Propulsion segment principally sells its products directly to independent boat builders, local, state, and foreign governments, and Brunswick's Boat segment. In addition, the Propulsion segment sells outboard engines through a global network of more than 8,800 marine dealers and distributors, specialty marine retailers, and marine service centers. The Propulsion segment designs and sells controls, rigging, and propellers to original equipment manufacturers (including Brunswick brands) and aftermarket retailers, distributors, and distribution businesses. White River Marine Group, LLC (including Tracker and Ranger Boats) and the Brunswick Boat Group are significant customers.
Mercury Marine brand engines are designed for use in recreational, commercial, and racing applications. Mercury Marine designs and sells four-stroke outboard engine models ranging from 2.5 to 600 horsepower in variations including naturally aspirated and supercharged engines. Mercury Marine and Mercury Racing manufacture inboard and sterndrive engine models ranging from 115 to 1,750 horsepower. Mercury Marine also manufactures two-stroke, non-DFI (direct fuel injection) engines for certain markets outside the United States. Most sterndrive and inboard engines are available with catalyst exhaust treatment and monitoring systems, and all Mercury Marine engines are compliant with applicable environmental, emissions, and noise regulations. 
Parts & Accessories Segment
The P&A segment includes Engine Parts and Accessories, the Advanced Systems Group (ASG), and Navico operating divisions. P&A had net sales of $2,008.1 million in 2021. P&A products are designed for and sold mostly to aftermarket retailers, distributors, and distribution businesses, as well as original equipment manufacturers (including Brunswick brands) for both marine and non-marine markets. Intercompany sales to the Brunswick Boat Group were insignificant to the segment's sales in 2021. 
The Engine P&A distribution businesses are leading distributors of both third party and our own marine parts and accessories throughout North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities. ASG products include marine electronics, digital control and monitoring systems, instruments, trolling motors, fuel systems, batteries, power management, and electrical 
systems, as well as specialty vehicle, mobile, and transportation aftermarket products. In October 2021, we completed the acquisition of Navico, a global leader in marine electronics and sensors, including multi-function displays, fish finders, autopilots, sonar, radar, and cartography. 
Boat Segment
The Boat segment consists of the Brunswick Boat Group (Boat Group), which manufactures and distributes recreational boats, and Business Acceleration. We believe that the Boat segment, which had net sales of $1,703.1 million during 2021, is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of pleasure motorboats. The Boat segment manages Brunswick's boat brands; evaluates and optimizes the Boat segment's boat portfolio; promotes recreational boating services and activities to enhance the consumer experience and dealer profitability, including through its Business Acceleration initiatives; and speeds the introduction of new technologies into boat manufacturing and design processes.
The Boat segment procures substantially all of its outboard engines, gasoline sterndrive engines, and gasoline inboard engines from Brunswick's Propulsion segment and boats often include other parts and accessories supplied by the P&A segment. The Boat Group sells its products through a global network of more than 1,300 dealers and distributors, with some operating in more than one location and some carrying more than one of our boat brands. The Boat Group's largest dealer, MarineMax, Inc., which has multiple locations and carries a number of the Boat Group's product lines, is a significant external customer. 
Business Acceleration
The Business Acceleration Group is dedicated to developing emerging and disruptive business models, focusing on services and subscriptions, engaging the next generation of boaters, and investing in early-stage innovative marine companies. Business Acceleration businesses accounted for 3 percent of Boat segment sales in 2021.
Business Acceleration's Freedom Boat Club (FBC) is the world's largest boat club network. FBC operates in more than 320 locations across the U.S., Canada, and Europe and has approximately 48,000 memberships. FBC members pay an initiation fee and monthly dues in exchange for gaining shared access to their local club’s diverse fleet of boats and reciprocal privileges at other FBC locations. 
Boateka, launched in 2021, sells certified pre-owned boats direct to consumers and differentiates itself by offering transparent pricing, a hassle-free purchase experience, and a 90-day warranty. Boating Services Network is a dealer finance and ancillary service business unit that provides floor plan financing through Brunswick Acceptance Company (USA) and Brunswick Commercial Finance (Canada), retail financing through Blue Water Finance and Mercury Repower Finance, retail extended warranties under the Passport and Passport Premier brands through Brunswick Product Protection Corporation, retail insurance through Boater's Choice Insurance, and marine services from close to 50 name brand providers through Brunswick Dealer Advantage. See the "Financing Joint Venture" section below for details about our related financing joint venture that operates closely with the Boating Services Network.
Financing Joint Venture
Through our Brunswick Financial Services Corporation subsidiary, we own a 49 percent interest in a joint venture, Brunswick Acceptance Company, LLC (BAC). Under the terms of the joint venture agreement (JV Agreement), BAC provides secured wholesale inventory floor plan financing to our boat and engine dealers. A subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Company owns the remaining 51 percent.
The JV Agreement contains a financial covenant that conforms to the maximum leverage ratio test in the Credit Facility described in Note 16 – Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The JV Agreement contains provisions allowing for the renewal of the JV Agreement or the purchase of the other party's interest in the joint venture at the end of its term. Alternatively, either partner may terminate the JV Agreement at the end of its term.
Refer to Note 10 – Financing Joint Venture in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our financial services offered through BAC.

Distribution
We utilize independent distributors, dealers, and retailers (Dealers) for the majority of our boat sales, sales of parts and accessories, and some sales of marine engines. We have over 19,000 active Dealers serving our business segments worldwide. Our Dealers typically carry one or more product categories and are independent companies or proprietors that range in size from small, family-owned businesses to a large, publicly-traded corporation with substantial revenues and multiple locations. Some Dealers sell our products exclusively, while a majority also carry competitor and complementary products. We partner with our dealer network to improve quality, service, distribution, and delivery of parts and accessories to enhance the boating customer's experience.

Besides our network of independent Dealers, we operate our own P&A distribution companies, which are leading distributors of marine parts and accessories with a network of warehouses located throughout the markets they serve, offering same or next-day delivery to a broad array of marine service facilities and Dealers. 

Many Dealers secure floor plan financing from BAC, and, to a lesser extent, from other third party financing companies, enabling them to stock product in advance of the peak selling season and providing stable channels for our products. Brunswick provides risk mitigation to BAC and other finance companies in the form of inventory repurchase commitments, under which we are obligated to repurchase inventory in the event of a Dealer's default. This risk mitigation is reflected in our Contingent Liabilities. We believe that these arrangements are in our best interest; however, these arrangements expose us to credit and business risk. Our business units, along with BAC, maintain active credit operations to manage this financial exposure, and we continually seek opportunities to sustain and improve the financial health of our various distribution channel partners. Refer to Note 8 – Financing Receivables and Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these arrangements.
Technology and Innovation
We believe Brunswick is uniquely positioned to define the future of the global marine industry. We are continuously and consistently innovating the future of recreational boating through growing service, connectivity, and alternative participation capabilities and businesses. To support our goal, we have established cross-functional and cross-business investments and initiatives, and hired new leaders with strong technology experience. We continue to develop solutions to further improve boater experiences both by advancing the efficiency and capabilities of our core product lines and through our ACES strategy. 
In 2021, we expanded our i-Jet Innovation Lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and announced a new partnership with Carnegie Robotics LLC (CRL), a leading provider of advanced robotics, sensors, and autonomous solutions for a wide range of commercial and government applications. For the second time in three years, Brunswick and Mercury Marine have jointly won the Soundings Trade Only “Most Innovative Marine Company" award, tying for top honors at the International BoatBuilders’ Exhibition and Conference (IBEX) in Tampa, Florida.
Some recent examples of innovation include Mercury Marine's new 7.6 liter V12 600 horsepower Verado outboard engine, which has won multiple awards, including a CES Innovation Award in 2022. Boating Industry awarded Brunswick several Top Product Awards, including for the Verado engine, Attwood Sahara Mk2 Automatic Bilge Pump, MotorGuide xi3 kayak trolling motor, BEP Marine Smart Battery Hub, Lowrance ActiveTarget Live Sonar system, Sea Ray Sundancer 370 outboard, and the Bayliner Element M15. Mastervolt's MLI Ultra 1250 battery was awarded a 2021 DAME (Design Award Marine Equipment) Design Award (which honors excellence in innovation, design, and sustainability in the global marine market) and Quicksilver's 705 Pilothouse won the Best of Boats 2021 Award in the “Best for Fishing” category for the second consecutive year. 
International Operations
Non-U.S. sales are set forth in Note 6 – Segment Information and Note 2 – Revenue Recognition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are also included in the table below, which details our non-U.S. sales by region:

(in millions) | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019 
Europe | $796.2 | | $550.1 | | $516.7 
Canada | 411.7 | | 246.3 | | 279.9 
Asia-Pacific | 439.0 | | 383.9 | | 274.9 
Rest-of-World | 237.4 | | 169.2 | | 165.8 
Total | $1,884.3 | | $1,349.5 | | $1,237.3
Total International Sales as a Percentage of Net Sales | 32 | % | | 31 | % | 30 | %

We transact a portion of our sales in non-U.S. markets in local currencies, while a meaningful portion of our product costs are denominated in U.S. dollars as a result of our U.S. manufacturing operations. As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar affects the financial results of our non-U.S. operations. 
Propulsion non-U.S. sales represented approximately 43 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2021. P&A non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 33 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2021. Boat non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 24 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2021. Of our boat sales in Canada and Europe, approximately 41 percent and 94 percent of the units, respectively, were produced in those regions. 
Raw Materials and Supplies
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from our supplier base, including commodities such as aluminum, resins, oil, and steel, as well as product parts and components, such as boat windshields. The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions. In 2021, our operations continued to experience intermittent supply chain uncertainty and disruptions. Our global procurement operations constantly strive to obtain adequate supplies, better leverage purchasing power across our divisions, and improve cost efficiencies. We mitigate commodity price risk on certain raw material purchases by entering into fixed priced contracts or derivatives to mitigate exposure related to changes in commodity prices.
Intellectual Property
We own intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, related to our current and future products and production methods, in the U.S. and certain other countries. By law, patents have a limited term, so our patents expire over time. Our trademarks and trade secrets have potentially indefinite lives. We consider our collection of intellectual property to be a valuable asset that is important to our competitive position. As of December 31, 2021, we own more than:
•900 U.S. patents;
•270 pending U.S. patent applications;
•420 foreign patents;
•160 pending foreign patent applications;
•1,560 U.S. registered trademarks; and
•525 foreign registered trademarks.
We invest substantial resources in acquiring, maintaining, and defending our intellectual property rights, and we expect to continue to do so. When feasible, we seek patent protection on products and production methods that are under development, and in areas of possible future development. We require employees who will develop intellectual property, or who have access to intellectual property, to sign confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements. We invest in physical and IT security programs to prevent theft and inadvertent disclosure of trade secrets. In addition to "Brunswick," our primary trademarks include Mercury Marine, Boston Whaler, Lund, and Sea Ray. 
Market and Competitive Conditions
Demand for our products is typically seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second quarter of the calendar year. Strong competition exists in each of our product groups, but no single enterprise competes with us in all product groups. In each product area, competitors range in size from large, highly-diversified companies to small, single-product businesses. We also indirectly compete with businesses that offer alternative leisure products or activities. The following summarizes our competitive position in each segment:

Propulsion: The Propulsion segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of recreational and commercial marine engines and related controls, rigging, and propellers. The marine engine market is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, including Japanese-based outboard engine manufacturers, as well as several smaller companies including Chinese manufacturers. Competitive advantage in this segment is a function of product features, technological leadership, quality, service, pricing, performance, manufacturing capabilities, depth of product portfolio, intuitive product controls, and durability, along with effective promotion, after-sales service, and distribution. 
P&A: The P&A segment is a world leader in manufacturing, marketing, and distributing parts and accessories, including engine parts and consumables, electrical products, navigation, marine instruments, and boat parts and systems. The parts and accessories and distribution market is highly competitive and fragmented. Our competitive advantage in this market includes our product breadth, proprietary parts and technology, global distribution network, extensive portfolio of recognized brands, sales team, delivery timing, and service.

Boat: The Boat segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of recreational motorboats. There are several major manufacturers of pleasure and offshore fishing boats, along with hundreds of smaller manufacturers. However, few major manufacturers compete in the breadth of categories or geographies in which our Boat segment competes. Consequently, this business is highly competitive by category but also highly fragmented. In all of our boat operations, we compete on the bases of product features, technology, quality, brand strength, dealer service, pricing, performance, value, durability and styling, along with effective promotion and distribution. In addition, Freedom Boat Club is the largest operator of boat club locations in the world, with more than 320 locations. This operating model provides boaters a unique and lower cost means to participate in boating. 
Climate Change and Environmental Compliance
Our customers rely on clean air and water to enjoy our products and services, and we are committed to practices and policies designed to help protect the environment and the well-being of our employees, customers, and the public. We seek to comply with applicable environmental regulatory and industry standards across all our facilities and in the products we manufacture. We strive to continually improve energy efficiency and minimize the carbon emissions of our operations, supply chain, and product portfolio and deliver more cost-effective and lower carbon technology products and solutions to our customers. These sustainability efforts are integrated into our business strategy and operations. Some recent sustainability projects and recognitions include: 
•Mercury Marine’s recently upgraded stainless steel propeller production facility, with a finishing process that eliminates as much as 1.5 million pounds of landfill waste and 4.5 million gallons of wastewater each year, significantly reducing our waste generation and water consumption.
•Installation of Mercury Marine's first photovoltaic array at its Fond du Lac, Wisconsin headquarters and the nearly 2,000 solar panels at our facility in Petit-Rechain, Belgium, both supporting Brunswick's increased use of renewable energy.
•Brunswick's entry into a virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) with Vesper Energy to offset a majority of the electrical power needs of Brunswick’s global operations through solar energy from Vesper’s 500 MW Hornet Solar project in Texas.
•Continued achievement of zero waste-to-landfill designations at our manufacturing and distribution facilities, including our Ft. Wayne Boat Group operations in Indiana and the Land ‘N’ Sea/Kellogg Marine facility in Old Lyme, Connecticut. 
•RELiON Battery's partnership with 1% for the Planet nonprofit organization, Wine To Water, supporting its initiative to bring clean water to villages and schools in East Africa. 
•ASG's design and delivery of over 1,200 generator set replacements to mobile customers, reducing CO2 emissions by more than 1,300 tons, with plans to increase installation of these gasoline generator alternatives for marine and RV products.
•Business Acceleration's new immersive on-water training program, BoatClass, designed to teach boating safety, assist boaters to gain confidence on the water, and promote boating safety and awareness.
•Brunswick's inclusion on Newsweek’s list of America's Most Responsible Companies for 2022.
•Sustainalytics' designation of Brunswick as Industry Top Rated in 2022.
For more information on our sustainability strategy, programming, data, and goals, we refer you to our annual Sustainability Report (which is not incorporated by reference herein), available on our website at https://www.brunswick.com/corporate-responsibility/sustainability. 
We anticipate that increased global regulation relating to climate change, such as climate disclosure requirements or product emissions limitations, will require us to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other penalties, including fines. Our manufacturing operations and products are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. As we evolve our product electrification strategy, we are subject to other regulations and requirements relating to the transportation, storage, handling, and use of batteries and the components used in battery manufacturing. Our products are subject to increasingly stringent regulations regarding substance content in jurisdictions where we sell products, including the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directives in the European Union and China, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) directive in the European Union, and the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and amendments. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition, or competitive position. There can be no assurance, however, that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us. Any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations, and contractual obligations could result in fines, suspension of production, the need to alter manufacturing processes, and legal liability, and could negatively affect our competitive position.
For further information, refer to Section 1A, Risk Factors, for a discussion of risks related to environmental compliance and to Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of certain environmental proceedings. 
Human Capital Resources
Brunswick is dedicated to creating an inspiring and inclusive work environment that attracts, develops, and retains top talent. This environment unlocks our employees’ potential to continue transforming the marine industry. 
Employee Engagement, Learning, and Development
We provide opportunities for continuous learning and development, such as:
•Brunswick University, a learning platform that offers courses in leadership and innovation, effective communication, and strategic thinking;
•LEAD, a leadership development program that helps guide leaders to create performance excellence and develop customer experience thinking; and 
•Rotational leadership programs to develop Brunswick’s future business and financial leaders. 
We recognize that we operate in competitive marketplaces when it comes to finding top talent, particularly in technical fields. We strive to offer our employees career-specific tools and provide skilled apprenticeship programs and robust on-the-job training opportunities. Our technical career track provides development for engineers and technology personnel who will shape our future ACES initiatives. We also incentivize employee innovation through a long-established inventor recognition award program.
Part of employee development includes performance feedback and management, for which we have a standard process that includes opportunities for employee engagement at every stage. We also acutely focus on appropriate succession planning and foster internal promotion to key positions.
We believe our strong compliance culture plays a central role in engagement and retention. The Integrity Playbook, Brunswick’s code of conduct, serves as the foundation of our Ethics Program. In 2021, 98 percent of our global salaried population completed our annual code of conduct training. 
Health and Safety
Employee health and safety are top priorities. We proactively identify and address potential safety risks in our business and operations. Our goal is to achieve zero work-related incidents and injuries. We maintain a Safety Management System (SMS) to formally address safety risk throughout the workplace. We use our SMS to manage potential work-related hazards that pose a risk of high consequence of potential injury. The implementation of both processes and systems that meet SMS criteria results in less frequent and less severe work-related incidents and injuries.
The Company's recordable and lost-time incident rates from 2019 to 2021 are as follows:
With respect to the continued COVID-19 pandemic, we have updated and implemented responsive pandemic protocols. Our plans incorporate governmental guidance, rules, and regulations regarding workplace safety. We also took steps to enhance employee health and wellness at both corporate and facility levels, including:
•Sponsored on-site or nearby vaccination clinics; 
•Established and supported a Wage Continuation Fund to provide employees with up to eighty hours of paid time off for COVID-related absences; and
•Established and supported a Vaccine Support Fund to provide employees with up to four hours of incentive pay for receiving a two-dose vaccine (2 hours of pay equivalent for one-dose).
Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation philosophy is to encourage performance that creates sustainable, long-term shareholder value; motivates achievement of financial and strategic goals; attracts, retains, and motivates talent; and reinforces our pay-for-performance culture. We are committed to pay equity, and we strive to ensure that employees are paid equitably for their work, regardless of their race or gender. 
We continuously evolve our benefits programs. For example, we have implemented paid parental leave and instituted a long-standing, robust wellness program to encourage employees to build and maintain healthy lifestyles. We strive to promote work-life balance and flexibility, including through our new hybrid workplace model, which will be based on a regular routine of 2-3 days a week in the office (and the remaining days at home) for most eligible U.S. salaried employees.
Diversity and Inclusion
We view diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as a strategic business initiative. We consider DEI to be a competitive advantage and have therefore focused our efforts on expanding diversity representation throughout our global workforce and increasing a culture of belonging at every worksite. Our enterprise-wide initiative, TIDE (Together: Inclusion, Diversity and Equity), is led by a cross-functional/divisional core team that creates accountability and drives progress to ensure DEI becomes firmly embedded in our business processes and behaviors. 
In 2021, TIDE launched three employee resource groups: Women on Water, Brunswick Black Professionals Network, and Asians and Pacific Islanders in Marine. Among other initiatives, TIDE also strengthened its partnership with the Executive Leadership Council (ELC) by providing two multi-year scholarships designed to increase educational opportunities for Black youth. 
We support increasing representation of diverse populations at all levels of the organization. Women make up one-third of our Executive Officer group. In 2021, four of our exceptional female colleagues won Boating Industry Magazine “Women Making Waves” awards. Women comprise approximately 27 percent of our total U.S. workforce, and racially diverse employees make up approximately 23 percent of our U.S. workforce. 
We are proud to note that Forbes named Brunswick to its 2021 list of America’s Best Large Employers, America’s Best Employers for Diversity, and America's Best Employers for Veterans, and that Forbes and Statista named us one of America’s Best Employers for Women, World’s Best Employers, and America's Best Employers for Veterans lists, all in 2021. 
Employee Information
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 18,582 people around the world, with roughly 62 percent in the U.S. This includes nearly 2,000 employees who joined Brunswick due to the Navico acquisition. Fewer than 25 percent of our U.S. employees belong to labor unions, and we believe that the relationships between our employees, the unions, and the Company remain stable. The collective bargaining agreement between Mercury Marine and its largest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) Lodge 1947, remains in place until August 26, 2023.
