     ITEM 1.             BUSINESS
     Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this Form 10-K to “we,” “our,” “us,” “our company” and “the Company” refer to QTS Realty Trust, Inc. (“QTS”), a Maryland corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including QualityTech, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to in this Form 10-K as the “Operating Partnership” or “predecessor.”     Overview 
     QTS is a leading provider of data center solutions to the world’s largest and most sophisticated hyperscale technology companies, enterprises and government agencies. Through our technology-enabled platform, delivered across mega scale data center infrastructure, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of secure and compliant IT solutions. Our data centers are facilities that power and support our customers’ IT infrastructure equipment and provide seamless access and connectivity to a range of communications and IT services providers. Across our broad footprint of strategically-located data centers, we provide flexible, scalable, and secure IT solutions including data center space, power and cooling, connectivity and value-add managed services for more than 1,100 customers in the financial services, healthcare, retail, government, and technology industries. We build out our data center facilities to accommodate both multi-tenant environments (hybrid colocation) and for executed leases that require significant amounts of space and power (hyperscale), depending on the needs of each facility at that time. We believe that we own and operate one of the largest portfolios of multi-tenant data centers in the United States, as measured by gross square footage, and have the capacity to nearly double our sellable data center raised floor space without constructing or acquiring any new buildings. In addition, we own more than 650 acres of land that is available at our data center properties that provides us with the opportunity to significantly expand our capacity to further support future demand from current and new potential customers.
     We operate a portfolio of 25 data centers located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. Within the United States, our data centers are concentrated in the markets which we believe offer the highest growth opportunities. Our data centers are highly specialized, mission-critical facilities utilized by our customers to store, power and cool the server, storage, and networking equipment that support their most critical business systems and processes. We believe that our data centers are best-in-class and engineered to adhere to the highest specifications commercially available to customers, providing fully redundant, high-density power and cooling sufficient to meet the needs of the largest companies and organizations in the world. We have demonstrated a strong operating track record of “five-nines” (99.999%) reliability since QTS’ inception. 
     QTS is a Maryland corporation formed on May 17, 2013 and is the sole general partner and majority owner of QualityTech, LP, our operating partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). Substantially all of our assets are held by, and our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. QTS’ Class A common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “QTS.”
     The Operating Partnership is a Delaware limited partnership formed on August 5, 2009 and was QTS’ historical predecessor prior to QTS’s initial public offering on October 15, 2013 (the “IPO”), having operated the Company’s business until the IPO. As of December 31, 2018, QTS owned an approximate 88.5% ownership interest in the Operating Partnership. 
     We believe that QTS has operated and has been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Our qualification as a REIT, and maintenance of such qualification, depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distributions to our stockholders and the concentration of ownership of our equity shares.
     On February 20, 2018, we commenced a strategic growth plan (the “Strategic Growth Plan”) focused on realigning our product offerings around our hyperscale and hybrid colocation product offerings while narrowing the scope of cloud and managed services products we deliver and support directly. During 2018, we successfully completed the implementation of our Strategic Growth Plan which resulted in a meaningful acceleration in our hyperscale and hybrid colocation

revenue and leasing performance, enhanced overall profitability in our business and a significant improvement in the overall predictability of our business performance as measured by customer churn.
     Our Portfolio
     We operate 25 data centers located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia, containing an aggregate of approximately 6.2 million gross square feet of space, including approximately 2.7 million “basis-of-design” raised floor square feet (approximately 95.5% of which is wholly owned by us including our data center in Santa Clara which is subject to a long-term ground lease), which represents the total sellable data center raised floor potential of our existing data center facilities. This reflects the maximum amount of space in our existing buildings that could be leased following full build-out, depending on the space and power configuration that we deploy. As of December 31, 2018, this space included approximately 1.5 million raised floor operating net rentable square feet, or NRSF, plus approximately 1.3 million square feet of additional raised floor in our development pipeline, of which approximately 154,000 raised floor square feet is expected to become operational by December 31, 2019. Of the total 154,000 raised floor square feet in our development pipeline that is expected to become operational by December 31, 2019, approximately 103,000 square feet was related to customer leases which had been executed as of December 31, 2018 but not yet commenced. Our facilities collectively have access to approximately 691 megawatts (“MW”) of available utility power. Access to power is typically the most limiting and expensive component in developing a data center and, as such, we believe our significant access to power represents an important competitive advantage.
     We account for the operations of all our properties in one reporting segment.
     Our Customer Base 
     Our data center facilities are designed with the flexibility to support a diverse set of solutions and customers. Our customer base is comprised of more than 1,100 different companies of all sizes representing an array of industries, each with unique and varied business models and needs. We serve Fortune 1000 companies as well as small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, including financial institutions, healthcare companies, retail companies, government agencies, communications service providers, software companies and global Internet companies. 
     We have customers that range from large enterprise and technology companies with significant IT expertise and data center requirements, including financial institutions, “Big Four” accounting firms and the world’s largest global Internet and cloud companies, to major healthcare, telecommunications and software and web-based companies.
     As a result of our diverse customer base, customer concentration in our portfolio is limited. As of December 31, 2018, only five of our more than 1,100 customers individually accounted for more than 3% of our monthly recurring revenue (“MRR”) (as defined below), with the largest customer accounting for approximately 12.8% of our MRR and the next largest customer accounting for only 4.9% of our MRR. 
     The majority of our MRR is generating from customers deployed in our U.S. data center locations. Customers deployed in our U.S. data center locations accounted for $31.0 million, $31.3 million and $30.3 million of total MRR as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and MRR from our international locations represented $0.2 million, $0.4 million and $0.6 million of MRR as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, our booked-not-billed MRR balance (which represents customer leases that have been executed, but for which lease payments have not commenced as of December 31, 2018) was approximately $5.2 million, or $62.6 million of annualized rent. As of December 31, 2017, our booked-not-billed MRR balance (which represents customer leases that have been executed, but for which lease payments have not commenced as of December 31, 2017) was approximately $3.9 million, or $46.8 million of annualized rent.
     Our Structure 
     Substantially all of our assets are held by, and our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. Our interest in the Operating Partnership entitles us to share in cash distributions from, and in the profits and losses of, the Operating Partnership in proportion to our percentage ownership. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, we generally have the exclusive power under the Operating Partnership’s partnership agreement to manage and conduct the Operating Partnership’s business and affairs.

     Our Competitive Strengths
     We believe that we are uniquely positioned in the data center industry and distinguish ourselves from other data center providers through the following competitive strengths: 
    
· | Software-Defined Data Center Platform – QTS’ Service Delivery Platform (SDP) is a software-defined orchestration platform that empowers customers to interact with their data and QTS services by providing real-time visibility, access and dynamic control of critical metrics across hybrid environments from a single platform. Collectively, the ability to digitize, analyze and automate significant amounts of data through SDP enables customers to innovate, make better business decisions and maximize their outsourced IT investments both within QTS and across multiple integrated service providers.

· | Platform Anchored by Strategically Located, Owned “Mega” Data Centers. Our larger “mega” data centers are located in Ashburn, Atlanta-Metro, Atlanta-Suwanee, Chicago, Fort Worth, Irving, Piscataway, Princeton, and Richmond with future sites available in Ashburn, Phoenix, Hillsboro and Manassas. Our facilities are constructed with the flexibility and capacity to support multi-tenant environments across a broad range of customer types, sizes and IT infrastructure requirements, which we believe delivers greater efficiency than single-use or smaller scale data centers. We believe that our data centers are engineered to among the highest specifications commercially available. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio of 25 data centers (14 of which are wholly owned, representing 95.5% of our raised square feet, including our data center in Santa Clara which is subject to a long-term ground lease) provides the opportunity to nearly double our sellable data center raised floor capacity without constructing or acquiring any new buildings. In addition, we own more

than 650 acres of land at our existing data center properties that provides us with the opportunity to significantly expand our capacity to further support future demand from current and new potential customers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Substantial Data Center Development Expertise. We have gained substantial expertise in developing data center facilities through the acquisition and redevelopment and/or construction of our operating facilities. Our data center development strategy is primarily focused on “mega” scale facilities that allow for significant incremental growth opportunity, either through ground up development or redevelopment of existing data center powered shell footprint. Our data center development strategy allows us to rapidly scale our developments in a modular manner to coincide with customer demand, and drives higher efficiency into our model through increased operating and build cost leverage at scale.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Balanced Approach to Hyperscale and Hybrid Colocation Verticals. The scale of our facilities combined with our innovative SDP platform and world-class customer service capability, gives us the ability to meet the needs of a broad set of customers ranging from large hyperscale users to smaller enterprises and government agencies. We believe customers will continue to have evolving and diverse IT needs and will prefer providers that can offer the flexibility, scalability and technology solutions that de-risk their future IT journey. We believe our ability to provide solutions to a broad addressable market enhances our leasing velocity, diversifies our customer mix, results in more balanced lease terms and optimizes cash flows from our assets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Diversified, High-Quality Customer Base. We have significantly grown our customer base from 510 in 2009 to over 1,100 as of December 31, 2018, with our largest customer accounting for approximately 12.8% of our MRR and no others greater than 4.9%. Only five of our customers exceeded 3% of our MRR. Our focus on premium customer service and our ability to grow with their IT needs allows us to achieve a low rental churn rate (which is the MRR lost in the period to a customer intending to fully exit our platform in the near term compared to the total MRR at the beginning of the period).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Robust In-House Sales Capabilities. Our in-house sales force has deep knowledge of our customers’ businesses and IT infrastructure needs and is supported by sophisticated sales management, reporting and incentive systems. Our internal sales force is structured by product offerings, specialized industry segments and, with respect to our colocation product, by geographical region. Therefore, unlike certain other data center companies, we are less dependent on data center brokers to identify and acquire or renew our customers, which we believe is a key enabler of our integrated strategy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Security and Compliance Focused. Our operations and compliance teams, led by seasoned management, are focused on providing a high level of physical security, cybersecurity and compliance solutions and consulting in all of our data centers and integrated across our product offerings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Balance Sheet Positioned to Fund Continued Growth. As of December 31, 2018 we had approximately $576 million of available liquidity consisting of cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow under our unsecured senior revolving credit facility. As we continue to expand our real estate portfolio, we can increase availability under our unsecured senior revolving credit facility by an additional $500 million through an accordion feature. In addition, during 2018 we demonstrated our ability to open up additional sources of capital to fund our continued growth including the issuance of approximately 3.2 million shares of convertible preferred stock with net proceeds of over $304 million and approximately 4.3 million shares of perpetual preferred stock for net proceeds of approximately $103 million.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Seasoned Management Team with Proven Track Record and Strong Alignment with Our Stockholders. Our senior management team represents a strong balance of significant experience across the commercial real estate and technology services industries. We believe our senior management team’s experience will enable us to capitalize on industry relationships by accessing capital from various sources and by providing an ongoing pipeline of attractive leasing and development opportunities while ensuring the future differentiation of our technology-enabled platform.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ability to Increase Our Margins Through Our Operating Leverage. We anticipate that our business and growth strategies can be substantially supported by our existing platform. The scale of our data center facilities provides a significant opportunity to realize positive operating leverage as we achieve higher

customer occupancy. We achieved 197% growth in Adjusted EBITDA from 2013 to 2018 compared to 153% growth in revenue during the same period.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continuing to Selectively Expand Our Platform to Other Strategic Markets. We expect to continue to selectively pursue attractive opportunities in strategic locations where we believe our fully integrated platform would give us a competitive advantage in the leasing of a facility or portfolio of assets. We also believe we can integrate additional data center facilities into our platform without adding significant incremental headcount or general and administrative expenses.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Commitment to Environmental Sustainability. We have a commitment to environmental sustainability that focuses on managing our data center power and space as effectively and efficiently as possible. We believe that our continued efforts and proven results from sustainably redeveloping properties give us a distinct advantage over our competitors in attracting new customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Competition
     We compete with developers, owners and operators of data centers and with IT infrastructure companies in the market for data center customers, properties for acquisition and the services of key third-party providers. In addition, we continue to compete with owners and operators of data centers and providers of cloud and managed services that follow other business models and may offer one or more of these services. We believe, however, that our product offerings set us apart from our competitors in the data center industry and makes us more attractive to customers, both large and small. In addition, we believe other providers are seeking ways to enter or strengthen their positions in the data center market.
     We compete for customers based on factors including location, network connectivity, critical load capacity, flexibility and expertise in the design and operation of data centers. New customers who consider leasing space at our properties and using our products and existing customers evaluating whether to renew or extend a lease also may consider our competitors, including wholesale infrastructure providers and colocation and managed services providers. In addition, our customers may choose to own and operate their own data centers rather than lease from us. 
     As an owner, developer and operator of data centers, we depend on certain third-party service providers, including engineers and contractors with expertise in the development of data centers and the provision of managed services. The level of competition for the services of specialized contractors and other third-party providers increases the cost of engaging such providers and the risk of delays in operating our data centers and completing our development and redevelopment projects. We also rely upon the services of specialized contractors for the provision of internet connectivity and software-related platforms and services. Competition for their services could lead to a negative impact on our business if they became unavailable to us.
     In addition, we face competition for the acquisition of additional properties suitable for the development of data centers from real estate developers in our industry and in other industries and from customers who develop their own data center facilities. Such competition may have the effect of reducing the number of available properties for acquisition, increasing the price of any acquisition and reducing the demand for data center space in the markets we seek to serve.
     Regulation 
     General 
     Data centers in our markets are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas. We believe that each of our properties has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business.      Americans With Disabilities Act 
     Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans With Disabilities Act (“ADA”) to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” or “commercial facilities” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require, for example, removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA.

However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect. 
     Environmental Matters 
     Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, a current or former owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, wastes or petroleum products on, under, from or in such property. These costs could be substantial, liability under these laws may attach without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. Most of our properties presently contain large underground or aboveground fuel storage tanks for emergency power, which is critical to our operations. If any of our tanks has a release of fuel to the environment, we likely would have to pay to clean up the contamination. In addition, prior owners and operators used some of our current properties for industrial and other purposes, which could have resulted in environmental contamination. Moreover, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may (1) expose us to third-party liability (e.g., for cleanup costs, bodily injury or property damage), (2) subject our properties to liens in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination, (3) impose restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used or businesses may be operated, or (4) materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. We also may be liable for the costs of remediating contamination at off-site disposal or treatment facilities where we arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at such facilities, without regard to whether we comply with environmental laws in doing so. Finally, there may be material environmental liabilities at our properties of which we are not aware. Any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on us.
     Our properties are subject to federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations and zoning requirements, including those regarding the handling of regulated substances and wastes, emissions to the environment, and fire codes. For instance, our properties are subject to regulations regarding the storage of petroleum for auxiliary or emergency power and air emissions arising from the use of power generators. In particular, generators at our data center facilities are subject to strict emissions limitations, which could preclude us from using critical back-up systems and lead to significant business disruptions at such facilities and loss of our reputation. In addition, we lease some of our properties to our customers who also are subject to such environmental, health and safety laws and zoning requirements. If we, or our customers, fail to comply with these various requirements, we might incur costs and liabilities, including governmental fines and penalties. Moreover, we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether future requirements will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that will materially and adversely affect us. Environmental noncompliance liability also could affect a customer’s ability to make rental payments to us. We require our customers to comply with these environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. 
     See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry, for additional information regarding these risks.
     Privacy and Cybersecurity 
     We may be directly and/or contractually subject to laws, regulations and policies for protecting sensitive data, consumer privacy and vital national interests. For example, the U.S. government has promulgated regulations and standards subject to authority provided through the enactment of a number of laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), and the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (“FISMA”), which require many corporations and federal, state and local governmental entities to control the security of, access to and configuration of their IT systems. A number of states also have enacted laws and regulations that require covered entities, such as data center operators, to implement and maintain security measures to protect certain types of information, such as Social Security numbers, payment card information, and other types of data, from unauthorized use and disclosure. In addition, industry organizations have adopted and implemented various security and compliance policies. For example, the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council has issued its mandatory Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”) which is applicable to all organizations processing payment card transactions. In addition to federal laws, the state of California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) in 2018, which regulates data collection and privacy collection. California’s law may still be subject to amendments before it goes into effect on January 1, 2020, and other states are considering similar laws.

     In connection with certain of these laws, we are subject to audits and assessments, and we may be required to obtain certain certifications. Audit failure or findings of non-compliance can lead to significant fines or decertification from engaging in certain activities. For example, violations of HIPAA/HITECH Act regulations can lead to fines of up to $1.5 million for all violations of a particular provision in a calendar year and our failure to demonstrate compliance in an annual PCI DSS audit may result in fines and exclusion from payment card networks. Additionally, violations of privacy or security laws, regulations or standards increasingly lead to class-action litigation, which can result in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. We cannot assure you that future laws, regulations and standards, or future interpretations of current laws, regulations and standards, related to privacy and security will not have a material adverse effect on us. 
     As a company that may process European personal data, we also may be subject to European data protection laws and regulations. The European Union (EU) Commission, Parliament, and Council adopted in April 2016 a new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that took effect in May 2018. The GDPR replaced the former European privacy regime, imposes new privacy requirements, and increases the likelihood of applicability of European law to entities like us, which are established outside the EU but may process data of European data subjects. Under the GDPR, there can be fines of up to €10,000,000 or up to 2% of the global sales, whichever is greater, for certain comparatively minor offenses, or up to €20,000,000 or up to 4% of the global sales, whichever is greater, for more serious offenses. 
     To facilitate and legitimize the transfer of both client and personnel data from the European Union (“EU”) to the United States, we self-certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, which requires organizations operating in the United States to provide assurance that they are adhering to relevant European standards for data protection for such transfers. QTS complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information transferred from the EU to the United States. However, our self-certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework may not be sufficient to ensure compliance with GDPR. Legal challenges have been brought in European courts seeking to declare the Privacy Shield Framework invalid under European law as a mechanism to legitimize transfers of personal data from the EU to the United States, which could require us to implement alternative means to address European cross border data transfer requirement. Also in 2018, EU member states were required to enact national laws to enforce the EU’s “Directive on security of network and information systems” (the “NIS Directive”), which lays out a number of cybersecurity expectations and notification obligations for regulated entities.
     Insurance 
     We carry comprehensive liability, property, extended coverage, earthquake, flood, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket property policy. We also carry coverage for general liability, technology professional liability, and cybersecurity. We have selected policy specifications and insured limits that we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice and, in the opinion of our management, the properties in our portfolio are currently adequately insured and the risk for any failure related to professional liability or a physical or cybersecurity breach are adequately covered by our insurance. We will not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses such as loss from riots, war, wet or dry rot, vermin and, in some cases, flooding and earthquake, because such coverage is not available or is not available at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, although we carry earthquake and flood insurance on our properties in an amount and with deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable, such policies are subject to limitations in certain flood and seismically active zones. Certain of the properties in our portfolio are located in areas known to be seismically active. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry—Uninsured and underinsured losses could have a material adverse effect on us.”     Employees 
     As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 606 persons, none of whom were represented by a labor union. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
