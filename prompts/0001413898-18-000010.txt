 A. H. Belo Corporation and subsidiaries are referred to collectively herein as “A. H. Belo” or the “Company.” The Company, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is a leading local news and information publishing company with commercial printing, distribution and direct mail capabilities, as well as expertise in emerging media and digital marketing. With a continued focus on extending the Company’s media platform, A. H. Belo delivers news and information in innovative ways to a broad spectrum of audiences with diverse interests and lifestyles.
 ﻿
 A. H. Belo Corporation was formed in February 2008 through a spin-off from its former parent company and is registered on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE trading symbol: AHC). The Company publishes The Dallas Morning News (www.dallasnews.com), Texas’ leading newspaper and winner of nine Pulitzer Prizes, and various niche publications targeting specific audiences. Its newspaper operations also provide commercial printing and distribution services to large national and regional newspapers and other businesses in the North Texas region.

 Business Overview
 ﻿
 The Company’s goal is to create profitability for investors through the following:
 ﻿

· | Be the premier provider of relevant and original local journalism published at scale in North Texas so citizens can make informed choices about their lives and the life of the communities in which they live. This commitment to excellence in journalism published at scale attracts and retains subscribers to both the print edition and digital site and applications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Provide customers with the most comprehensive suite of innovative marketing solutions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Since the Company’s spin-off in 2008, the print media industry has encountered continuous declines in revenue primarily due to the secular shift of readers and advertisers to digital platforms. The Company has sought to limit its exposure to these industry risks through greater development and enhancement of digital platforms for delivery of news and advertising, and through diversification of sources of revenue, from both organic growth and acquisitions of marketing services and new products.
 ﻿
 On March 2, 2017, the Company acquired the remaining 20 percent voting interest in DMV Holdings. The initial purchase of 80 percent voting interest in DMV Holdings occurred in January 2015. DMV Holdings holds all outstanding ownership interests of three Dallas-based companies, Distribion, Inc. (“Distribion”), Vertical Nerve, Inc. (“Vertical Nerve”) and CDFX, LLC (“MarketingFX”). These businesses specialize in local marketing automation, search engine marketing, and direct mail and promotional products, respectively. The Company believes this acquisition complements the product and service offerings currently available to A. H. Belo customers, thereby strengthening the Company’s diversified product portfolio and allowing for greater penetration in a competitive advertising market. Additionally, the Company has realized efficiencies through internal fulfillment of work that businesses previously out-sourced to third-party vendors and therefore can provide businesses a more comprehensive suite of marketing solutions. This complements the organic growth realized by Speakeasy and Connect (programmatic advertising), which together offer content development, social media management, and multi-channel marketing solutions through targeted and programmatic exchanges. All of these marketing services have been combined into a single division titled Belo + Company.
 ﻿
 The Company has redesigned and expanded its website platforms and mobile apps to provide a better customer experience with its digital news and information reporting. In 2016, the Company completed a multi-phase expansion of dallasnews.com to provide enhanced capabilities on its flagship website and further development of its entertainment brands. In 2015, the Company completed the expansion of its e-commerce functions and extended its interface with social media platforms and mobile devices. Complementing this digital expansion, in 2015, the Company recruited a new editor with the goal of transforming the Company into a more effective digital news organization. With these investments, and utilizing innovative journalists in other key roles, the Company strengthened the depth of experience to support the broader delivery of news on digital platforms with focus on becoming a digital-first newsroom. In 2017, the Company invested in and moved to a new corporate office in downtown Dallas that provides for a more flexible office space and a contemporary digital newsroom.
 ﻿
 In the first quarter of 2017, in conjunction with the promotion of Grant Moise from Senior Vice President Business Development / Niche Products to General Manager of The Dallas Morning News and Executive Vice President of A. H. Belo, the Company reorganized its two reportable segments based on changes in reporting structure and the go-to-market for the Company’s service and product offerings. The two reportable segments are Publishing and Marketing Services. Prior to 2015, these operations were reported as a single segment. The results of operations related to the Company’s segments are presented in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 ﻿
 The Company’s Publishing segment includes the operations of The Dallas Morning News (www.dallasnews.com), Texas’ leading newspaper and winner of nine Pulitzer Prizes and various niche publications targeting specific audiences. These operations generate revenue from sales of advertising within its newspaper and digital platforms, subscription and retail sales of its newspapers, sponsorship advertising for events and commercial printing and distribution services, primarily related to national and regional newspapers. Businesses within the Publishing segment leverage the production facilities, subscriber and advertiser base, and digital news platforms to provide additional contribution margin. 
 ﻿
 The Marketing Services segment includes marketing services generated by DMV Holdings and its subsidiaries Distribion, Vertical Nerve and MarketingFX. The Marketing Services segment also includes Speakeasy and digital advertising through Connect. The Company operates the portfolio of assets within its Marketing Services segment as separate businesses that sell digital marketing and advertising through different channels, including programmatic advertising and content marketing within the social media environment.
 ﻿
 Through the Company’s technological, capital and organizational investments, management will continue to focus its attention and initiatives on maximizing the return on its print assets and enhancing its digital publishing capabilities, thereby offering marketers performance-based media and marketing solutions through which they can grow their businesses.

Publishing Segment
 ﻿
 The Dallas Morning News’ first edition was published on October 1, 1885 and is one of the leading metropolitan newspapers in the United States. The newspaper is distributed primarily in Dallas County and 10 surrounding counties. This coverage area represents one of the most populous and fastest growing metropolitan areas in the country. The Dallas Morning News has been awarded nine Pulitzer Prizes for news reporting, editorial writing and photography. The Dallas Morning News also publishes Briefing, a newspaper distributed two days per week at no charge to over 200,000 nonsubscribers in select coverage areas; and Al Dia, an award-winning Spanish-language newspaper published on Wednesdays and Sundays and distributed at no charge to over 100,000 households in select coverage areas. Unless otherwise noted, the financial and operating results of all publications are reported as The Dallas Morning News.
 ﻿
 Businesses producing and providing services within the print and paper industry have encountered significant declines in revenue as a result of increasing use of the internet for delivery of information. These businesses have been challenged to find alternative solutions to offset the loss of revenue. The majority of revenues within the newspaper industry were historically generated from display and classified advertisements within the newspapers followed by revenues from subscription and retail sales of newspapers. Revenues from subscription and retail sales of newspapers have experienced greater resilience as readers have been willing to pay higher prices for the product, which has substantially offset lower circulation volumes. Since the spin-off from its former parent company in 2008, the Company has faced ongoing revenue declines primarily in advertising within the newspapers.
 ﻿
 The following chart presents the revenue trend of the Publishing segment’s products since the Company's spin-off in 2008.

 The following describes the various revenue streams within the Publishing segment.
 ﻿
 Advertising Revenue - Advertising revenue accounted for approximately 52 percent of total revenue within the Publishing segment for 2017. The Company has a comprehensive portfolio of print and digital advertising products, which include display, classified, preprint and digital advertising. Display revenue results from sales of advertising space within the Company’s core newspapers and niche publications to local, regional or national businesses with local operations, affiliates or resellers. Classified revenue, which includes automotive, real estate, employment, obituaries and other, results from sales of advertising space in the classified and other sections of the Company’s newspapers. Preprint revenue results from sales of preprinted advertisements or circulars inserted into the Company’s core newspapers and niche publications, or distributed by mail or third-party distributors to households in targeted areas in order to provide total market coverage for advertisers. The Company’s capabilities allow its advertisers to selectively target preprint distribution at the sub-zip code level in order to optimize coverage for the advertisers’ locations. Digital publishing revenue includes the sales of banner, classified and native advertisements on the Company’s news and entertainment-related websites and mobile apps. The Company’s auto sales division offers targeted advertising to auto dealerships primarily in the North Texas region desiring to advertise their inventory on the cars.com platform. The Company is under contract to sell this advertising through September 2019.
 ﻿
 In addition to daily newspapers, the Company publishes niche publications that provide a vehicle for delivery of display, classified, and preprint advertising, typically to nonsubscribers of the Company’s core newspapers and at no charge. These publications target specific demographic groups, geographies and nonsubscriber households. Most niche publications have related websites and mobile applications, allowing digital access by consumers. The niche publications provide unique content and incorporate the news content from the core newspaper while leveraging the Company’s printing, distribution and technology infrastructure to print and distribute their publications at lower costs. From time to time, the Company produces magazines or special newspaper editions to promote business, sporting or other events in the North Texas region, such as the Top 100 Places to Work edition. These publications allow the Company to generate revenue through advertising sales in the publications and through increased circulation or fees for the publications. 
 ﻿
 Circulation Revenue - Circulation revenue includes subscription and single copy sales related to the Company’s core newspapers in print and digital formats. A. H. Belo’s steadfast commitment to producing superior, unduplicated local journalism enables the Company’s newspapers to charge premium subscription rates. The Dallas Morning News’ goal is to maximize the amount of recurring revenue from consumers of the Company’s print and digital products. The Company continuously assesses the journalism provided to subscribers and their willingness and ability to pay higher rates by geographic area. Each year since 2008, the Company has implemented effective rate increases to select subscribers or retailers. Periodically throughout each year, various special interest magazines, such as Healthy Living or Your Money, are included with Sunday editions as a part of subscribers’ home delivery news package. Subscriber and retail rates for these editions reflect a charge for this content. A digital replica version of The Dallas Morning News is offered on dallasnews.com for subscribers to purchase if they prefer to consume news through a digital device in a more traditional format. 
 ﻿
 The Company’s news websites, including dallasnews.com and aldiadallas.com, are the leading English and Spanish news and entertainment digital platforms in the North Texas region. The news websites offer users late-breaking and other up-to-date news coverage, user-generated content, advertising, e-commerce and other services. Readers can access news content across multiple digital platforms and obtain relevant local customized content and advertising. The Company’s journalists have expanded their reach and deepened their engagement with audiences by delivering news and content through social media platforms, such as blogs, Facebook and Twitter, which direct traffic to its core websites. With the reorganization of its editorial and newsroom personnel in 2015, the Company has strengthened its focus to provide greater journalistic content on its digital platforms with increased emphasis towards video.
 ﻿
 In 2017, the Company continued to invest in its website as it further expanded data collection capabilities for traffic to its websites, allowing support of native application strategies, and greater interface with visitors and advertisers. In 2016, the Company completed a multi-phase expansion of dallasnews.com to provide enhanced capabilities on its flagship website and further development of its entertainment brands. In 2015, the Company completed the expansion of its e-commerce functions and extended its interface with social media platforms and mobile devices. A standalone website was created for guidelive.com, the premier website for entertainment news and events in North Texas. Unique landing pages solely dedicated to the Company’s sportsdayDFW.com and sportsdayHS.com branded platforms were developed, and separate websites for these platforms were launched in 2016. These enhancements allow the websites to leverage the identity of their brands to gain greater audience and to quickly respond as technology evolves and new media are introduced, such as wearable devices or hybrid phone or tablet devices. In May 2016, the Company launched a meter on dallasnews.com and sportsdayDFW.com. In 2017, the Company furthered its investment in the meter in order to offer greater localized digital journalism in order to increase conversion of audiences to paid digital subscribers.

  ﻿
 Printing, Distribution and Other Revenue - Printing, distribution and other revenue accounted for approximately 13 percent of total revenue within the Publishing segment for 2017 and includes commercial printing, distribution, direct mail and event-based services. The Company provides commercial printing and distribution services, leveraging the capacity of its production and distribution assets. The Company believes the incremental revenue from these services allows a greater return on the Company’s operating assets.
 ﻿
 Commercial printing services are provided for certain national newspapers that require regional printing and for various local and regional newspapers. Newsprint used in the production of large national newspapers is generally provided by the customer. Home delivery and retail outlet distribution services are also provided for other national and regional newspapers delivered into the Company’s coverage areas. A direct mail business is operated in Phoenix, Arizona, providing mailed advertisements for its business customers.
 ﻿
 CrowdSource was formed in 2013 to provide event marketing services including event activation and promotion for large-scale community events, seminars and festivals. CrowdSource promotes community events, such as One Day University, an educational speaker event; Savor, a premium food, wine and spirits festival in Dallas; and other community-related events.

 Marketing Services Segment
 ﻿
 The following describes the various revenue streams within the Marketing Services segment.
 ﻿
 Digital marketing services are offered by the Company’s sales and marketing divisions. The Company’s strategy, with regard to the Marketing Services segment, is to be able to offer businesses a comprehensive marketing solutions package while providing a greater percentage of the marketing fulfillment costs internally that was previously outsourced to third-party providers. The Company has aligned management and the Company’s sales teams to provide a cross-functional integrated approach to maximize the development of these businesses. Digital marketing services are provided through the following service offerings:
 ﻿

· | Distribion, a DMV Holdings business, offers multi-channel marketing solutions through subscription sales of its cloud-based software, allowing customers to manage and individualize their marketing campaigns. Distribion also provides multi-channel marketing services to customers not having access to its proprietary software.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Vertical Nerve, a DMV Holdings business, provides marketing analytics, search engine marketing and other marketing related services to businesses across the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Speakeasy, formed in 2012, provides turnkey social media account management and content marketing services principally for businesses in the North Texas region.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Connect manages multi-channel advertising campaigns for its customers, allowing customers to target demographic audiences using data analytics and allowing customers to determine the delivery media such as email campaign, banner impressions or video views on third-party websites. Connect is able to design and fulfill customer campaign requirements through acquisition of advertising inventory on programmatic exchanges.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Other marketing services include business marketing products offered through MarketingFX, a DMV Holdings business. These products include promotional products for businesses to supply to employees and customers.
 ﻿
 Raw Materials and Distribution
 ﻿
 The basic material used in publishing newspapers is newsprint. Currently, most of the Company’s newsprint is obtained through a purchasing consortium. Management believes the Company’s sources of newsprint, along with available alternate sources, are adequate for the Company’s current needs, though the Company experienced a tightening of supply in the North American newsprint market beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 ﻿
 During 2017, Company operations consumed 23,296 metric tons of newsprint at an average cost of $564 per metric ton. Consumption of newsprint in 2016 was 26,752 metric tons at an average cost of $532 per metric ton.
 ﻿
 The Company’s newspapers and other commercial print products are produced at its facility in Plano, Texas. Distribution of printed products to subscribers, retailers and newsstands is made under terms of agreements with third-party distributors. The Company believes a sufficient number of third-party distributors exist to allow uninterrupted distribution of the Company’s products.

 Competitive Strengths and Challenges
 The Company’s strengths are:

· | the largest news gathering operation in North Texas
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | the opportunity to build valuable first-party data sets about consumers in North Texas due to the millions of unique visitors who come to the Company’s websites and mobile applications monthly
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the ability to develop innovative new product and service offerings which leverage the Company’s brand equity, existing content, distribution platforms, technologies and relationships
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product or service offerings that allow the Company to offer advertisers a customized and integrated advertising and marketing solution through desired media channels
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | sufficient liquidity to allow the Company to opportunistically invest in, or acquire, businesses that complement the Company’s advertising or marketing services businesses
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | an affluent and educated demographic base in its market
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | the ability to market print or digital products and services to large and targeted audiences at low marginal costs
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a large sales force with knowledge of the marketplaces in which the Company conducts its business and relationships with current and potential advertising clients
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the ability to effectively manage operating costs according to market pressures
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The Company’s challenges are:

· | timely growth of revenue and profit margins related to the Company’s marketing services businesses and digital subscriptions that would provide for an offset to declines in revenue and profit margins of the Company’s print operations
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | maintaining and growing advertising and circulation revenues in a competitive environment with increased competition from other media, particularly internet-based media
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | effective monetization of locally created online content on the Company’s websites while balancing the impact of potential lower traffic volumes with an established metered-based model
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 In response to the decline in print revenue, the Company has developed or acquired capabilities to offer customers advertising and marketing solutions through multiple media channels. The Company leverages its news content to improve engagement on the Company’s digital platforms that results in increased digital subscriptions and associated revenue. The Company also continues to diversify its revenue base by leveraging the available capacity of its existing assets to provide print and distribution services for newspapers and other customers requiring these services by introducing new advertising and marketing services products, by increasing circulation prices and through growth of the Company’s event-based business.    ﻿
 As a result of declining print circulation, the Company has developed broad digital strategies designed to provide readers with multiple platforms for obtaining online access to local news. The Company continues to obtain additional key demographic data from readers, which allows the Company to provide content desired by readers and to modify marketing and distribution strategies to target and reach audiences valued by advertisers. The Company has implemented a programmatic digital advertising platform which provides digital ad placement and targeting efficiencies and increases utilization of digital inventory within the Company’s and external websites. In addition, the Company’s sales teams are implementing initiatives that better utilize pay for performance data and other metrics to generate and return lost advertising dollars to its print business.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 The Company’s newspapers, niche publications and related websites primarily serve audiences in the North Texas area. The Company competes for advertising revenue for its newspapers and websites with other print and digital media companies. Advertising revenues for the Company’s newspapers and websites are responsive to circulation and traffic volumes, demographics of its subscriber base, advertising results, rates and customer service. Advertising on digital platforms is highly competitive and largely dominated by large internet companies. As advertisers reallocate marketing expenditures from print to digital channels, the Company believes its strong local brand, its suite of print and digital advertising and marketing services products and its programmatic digital advertising platform will allow it to offer unique advertising and marketing solutions to local businesses on a competitive scale.
 ﻿
 The Dallas Morning News has the highest paid print circulation volumes in the North Texas area while competing with one other metropolitan newspaper in parts of its geographic market. Print circulation revenues are primarily challenged due to free and readily-accessible news, entertainment, advertising and other content available through the internet. This secular shift from print to digital media continues as consumer lifestyles embrace technological advancements, particularly with mobile devices, which provide access to a wide variety of digital news and advertising alternatives, including news and social media websites, online advertising networks and exchanges, online classified services, and direct email advertising. Competition for readers is primarily based on the mode of delivery, quality of the Company’s journalism, price, timeliness of its interaction with audiences and customer service. News and other digital content produced by the Company’s newspapers and niche publications are available via its websites, mobile applications and through email. The Company offers competitive technology for accessing digital content on mobile devices and via personal computers. Journalists engage online readers through blogs, Twitter and other social media posts. The Company has modified its websites to provide greater video content and advertising, links to other sites sought by readers, improved layouts, and a better interface with mobile applications.
 ﻿
 Seasonality
 ﻿
 A. H. Belo’s advertising revenues are subject to moderate seasonality, with advertising revenue typically higher in the fourth calendar quarter of each year because of the holiday shopping season. The level of advertising sales in any period may also be affected by advertisers’ decisions to increase or decrease their advertising expenditures in response to anticipated consumer demand and general economic conditions. Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, the Company had 1,090 employees.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
 The following risk factors are based on management’s current knowledge and estimates of factors affecting the Company’s operations, both known and unknown. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking information as actual results may differ materially from the possible risks and outcomes discussed herein. In addition, a number of other factors (those identified elsewhere in this document and others, both known and unknown) may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.
 A. H. Belo’s newspapers operate in highly competitive media markets, and the Company’s ability to generate revenue depends on the effectiveness of the Company’s strategy to promote new and existing products.
 The Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive media markets. A. H. Belo’s newspapers compete for advertising and circulation revenue with other newspapers, websites, digital applications, magazines, television, radio, direct mail and other media. The continued expansion of digital media and communications, particularly social media, mobile applications and the proliferation of tablet and mobile devices has increased some consumers’ preferences to receive all or part of their news and information digitally. Websites such as craigslist.org, monster.com and cars.com provide a cost efficient platform for reaching wide but targeted audiences for classified advertising. Websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google and Yahoo! are successful in gathering and making available national and local news and information from multiple sources and attracting a broad readership base.
 Historically, newspaper publishing was viewed as a cost-effective method of delivery for various forms of advertising to a large audience. The continued development and deployment of new technologies and greater competition from digital media increases the challenge to the Company to provide competitive offerings to retain its print and digital advertisers and subscribers.
 A. H. Belo’s ability to stabilize advertising and circulation revenue through price and volume increases may be affected by competition from other forms of media and other publications available in the Company’s various markets, declining consumer spending on discretionary items such as newspapers, decreasing amounts of free time and declining frequency of regular newspaper buying among certain demographic groups. The Company may also incur higher costs competing for paid circulation. If the Company is not able to compete effectively, revenue may decline and the Company’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
 Purchasing practices of national advertisers could negatively impact the Company’s pricing and ability to up-sell other products, which could result in lower revenues.
 In line with the Company’s overall print advertising revenue trend, national advertisers’ marketing budgets have been significantly reduced. In addition, many national advertisers which place advertising in the Company’s newspapers are centralizing purchasing functions and streamlining the buying and negotiating process. This could result in the commoditization of certain advertising products, which limits the Company’s ability to promote its position in the market, the customer service value of its relationship with the advertiser, and the benefits of its suite of products, including the Company’s ability to up-sell other products. This also may put the Company in competition with other advertising companies that are able to offer lower prices for a larger geographical area than the Company covers. Accordingly, the Company could experience a decline in pricing which could result in lower revenues and profitability.
 ﻿
 Decreases in circulation may adversely affect A. H. Belo’s advertising and circulation revenue.
 ﻿
 A. H. Belo’s newspapers, and the newspaper industry as a whole, are challenged to maintain and grow print circulation volume. To the extent circulation volume declines cannot be offset by rate increases, the Company will realize lower circulation revenue. Further, circulation volume declines could also result in lower rates and volumes for advertising revenue.
 The expansion of programmatic advertising could result in lower realization of advertising revenue sold by the Company’s news and entertainment websites.
 Digital marketing services are becoming a significant component to business customers advertising strategies. Barriers to entering this industry are low and many competitors offering advertising services on traditional advertising platforms are seeking to gain market share, particularly through programmatic exchanges. As this industry expands, purchasing and selling of advertisement on exchanges is expected to result in lower costs of advertising which in-turn could be passed on to businesses customers. Such events could result in lower profit realization for digital advertising revenue within the Company’s news and entertainment websites as it competes with exchange platforms for advertising dollars. 


 

A. H. Belo Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K | PAGE 11

 

 


 The growth and profitability of the Company’s marketing services businesses are largely dependent on acceptance by local businesses and the recruitment and retention of key employees.
 Marketing services offerings are rapidly evolving as business customers seek quantifiable results to measure the effectiveness of their advertising spending. The Company’s marketing services customers primarily represent mid-sized businesses with varying degrees of knowledge and familiarity with online marketing and advertising campaigns. The success of the Company’s marketing services offerings is dependent on the education of these customers on the benefits of these services to their businesses. Challenges may include the accuracy or perceived accuracy of metrics provided and the ability of the customer to properly interpret the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns against benchmarks that may not be reliable.
 Increasing the Company’s client base and achieving broader market acceptance of its suite of cross-channel, interactive marketing solutions will depend on the ability of sales and marketing teams and their capabilities to obtain new clients as well as sell additional products and services to existing clients. Competition is fierce for direct sales professionals with the skills and technical knowledge that is required, and the Company may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future. The ability to achieve significant future revenue growth will depend on the success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales professionals. New and planned hires require significant training and time before sales teams become fully productive, and may not become as productive as quickly as anticipated. The Company’s growth prospects could be harmed if efforts to expand, train and retain the direct sales team do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue.
 Newsprint prices are volatile and may increase in the future, and newsprint supply may become increasingly scarce as paper mills exit the market.

 The basic raw material for newspapers is newsprint, the cost of which for the last three years has represented between approximately 5.0 percent and 6.0 percent of A. H. Belo’s revenues. The Company’s publishing operations depend significantly upon the continuing availability of newsprint and the Publishing segment’s results of operations may be impacted significantly by changes in newsprint prices. The price of newsprint historically has been volatile. Consolidation in the North American newsprint industry has reduced the number of suppliers and has led to paper mill closures and conversions to other grades of paper, which in turn has decreased overall newsprint capacity and increased the likelihood of higher prices. Other factors that may increase prices the Company pays for newsprint includes:

· | The imposition of tariffs or other restrictions on non-U.S. suppliers of paper
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increases in supplier operating expenses due to rising raw material or energy costs or other factors
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Decreases in the Company’s current consumption levels
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | The Company’s inability to maintain existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 In addition, the Company’s ability to supply its publishing operation with newsprint has been and may continue to be disrupted by such factors as:

· | The Company’s suppliers may be unable to deliver newsprint due to labor unrest
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Trucks or other means of transporting newsprint may become unavailable
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Paper mills may close at a faster rate than declines in the demand for paper
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 A. H. Belo currently purchases most of its newsprint through a purchasing consortium. Significant increases in newsprint costs or the Company’s inability to obtain an adequate supply of newsprint in the future could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.    ﻿
 The Company’s potential inability to successfully execute cost control measures could result in total operating costs that are greater than expected.
 ﻿
 The primary costs of the Company’s operations include employee compensation and benefits, followed by distribution costs, newsprint and other production materials and technology costs. The Company has taken steps to lower costs through selling or discontinuing production of unprofitable operations and products, reducing personnel and restructuring employee benefits and implementing general cost control measures. Although the Company continues its cost control efforts, the Company may be unable to match revenue declines with offsetting cost reductions.
 ﻿
 Certain operating costs may not fluctuate directly with changes in revenue, which could result in lower margins if advertising and circulation volumes decline. The Company could also experience inflationary pressures from newsprint and other suppliers and be

unable to generate additional revenue or additional cost reductions to offset these inflationary pressures. The Company utilizes outside service providers to distribute its newspapers, and certain preprint advertising is distributed through the mail. Higher fuel costs or higher 
 postage rates could result in higher direct costs incurred by the Company to distribute its products. 
 ﻿
 Increasing cost of healthcare benefits offered to employees requires the Company to evaluate the scope of benefits offered and the method in which health care benefits are delivered. Competition for qualified personnel may require the Company to spend more on compensation costs, including employee benefits, to attract and retain its workforce.
 ﻿
 The Company may not be able to pass on to customers these potential cost increases given the significant competition for advertising dollars and the ability of customers to obtain their news from other media at a low cost. If the Company does not achieve expected savings or if operating costs increase due to the creation and development of new products or otherwise, total operating costs may be greater than anticipated.
 ﻿
 The Company believes appropriate steps are being taken to control costs. However, if the Company is not successful in matching revenue declines with corresponding cost reductions, the Company’s ability to generate future profits could be affected. 
 ﻿
 The sufficiency of the Company’s liquidity is dependent upon meeting future financial goals.
 ﻿
 Although the Company’s cash holdings are sufficient to meet foreseeable operating needs, the Company must achieve expected financial goals. Unplanned events such as significant required pension plan contributions, tax obligations, significant loss of revenue, unprofitable operations or deterioration of collections of receivables, could accelerate the use of the Company’s cash balances. The Company’s ability to raise financial capital in the future may be hindered due to uncertainty regarding the newspaper industry’s prospective performance. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, the Company may be forced to sell assets at below-market prices to sustain its operations.
 ﻿
 There can be no assurance that the Company’s product and service initiatives will be successful.
 ﻿
 The Company has introduced new product and service initiatives designed to grow advertising and market services revenue and to respond to the challenges of maintaining revenue in existing markets. These initiatives may not be successful, may not be marketable or profitable and could result in declines in financial performance.
 ﻿
 Significant turnover of key employees could expose the Company to loss.
 ﻿
 A. H. Belo relies on the efforts of its senior executive officers and other members of management. The Company is located in a strong economic region of the United States with low unemployment and strong competition for senior management personnel. The success of the Company’s businesses depends heavily on its ability to successfully execute the required responsibilities of these roles as well as the Company’s ability to retain current management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. The loss of key personnel results in additional recruiting and training costs to the Company. Further, the exposure for loss to the Company and the potential delay of operations is elevated until the employee has sufficient knowledge commensurate with their assigned duties.
 ﻿
 Market conditions could increase the funding requirements associated with the Company’s pension plans.
 ﻿
 The Company is the sole sponsor of A. H. Belo Pension Plans I and II (collectively, the “A. H. Belo Pension Plans” or the “Pension Plans”) and is required to meet certain pension funding requirements as established under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”). Instability in global and domestic capital markets may result in low returns on the assets contributed to the A. H. Belo Pension Plans. Additionally, low yields on corporate bonds may decrease the discount rate, resulting in a higher funding obligation. Although legislation was enacted into law in 2012, which provided limited funding relief, market conditions could materially increase the funding requirements associated with the A. H. Belo Pension Plans, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s liquidity and financial condition.
 ﻿
 Adverse results from new litigation or governmental proceedings or investigations could adversely affect A. H. Belo’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
 ﻿
 From time to time, A. H. Belo and its subsidiaries are subject to litigation, governmental proceedings and investigations. Adverse determinations in any such matters could require A. H. Belo to make monetary payments or result in other sanctions or findings that could affect adversely the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
 ﻿
 A. H. Belo’s directors and executive officers have significant combined voting power and significant influence over its management and affairs.

A. H. Belo directors and executive officers hold approximately 50 percent of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding voting stock as of December 31, 2017. A. H. Belo’s Series A common stock has one vote per share and Series B common stock has 10 votes per share. Except for certain significant corporate transactions, generally all matters to be voted on by A. H. Belo’s shareholders must be approved by a majority of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding voting stock, voting as a single class. Certain corporate transactions, such as a merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, dissolution of the Company, the alteration, amendment, or repeal of A. H. Belo’s bylaws by shareholders and certain amendments to A. H. Belo’s certificate of incorporation, require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock, voting as a single class. Accordingly, A. H. Belo’s directors and executive officers will have significant influence over the Company’s management and affairs and over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions. This ownership may limit other shareholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, A. H. Belo may take actions that some shareholders do not view as beneficial.
