History of our Company
 
The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed in March 2014 as a limited liability company under the name, The Greater Cannabis Company, LLC. The Company remained a wholly owned subsidiary of Sylios Corp until March 2017. The Company’s initial business plan was to concentrate on cannabis related investment and development opportunities through its online retail store, direct equity investments, joint ventures, licensing agreements or acquisitions. Our current operations are focused on our online store, GCC Superstore.
 
On July 31, 2018, the Company entered into and consummated a voluntary share exchange transaction with Green C Corporation, a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario (“Green C”) and the shareholders of Green C (the “Selling Shareholders”) pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement by and among the Company, Green C and the Selling Shareholders (the “Exchange Agreement”).
 
In accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Company issued 9,411,998 shares of its preferred stock, par value $0.001 (the “Shares”) to the Selling Shareholders and certain individuals named below (collectively, the “Shareholder Group”) in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Green C (the “Exchange Transaction”). As a result of the Exchange Transaction, the Selling Shareholders acquired 29.67% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock, Green C became the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary and the Company acquired 100% of the business and operations of Green C.


After the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, we switched our business model in fiscal 2018 and no longer intend to pursue E-commerce, advertising, licensing (except as specified below) or direct investment operations. We are now engaged in the development and commercialization of innovative cannabinoid therapeutics. Our mission is to bring our products to the global market through partnerships with leading cannabis and pharmaceutical companies, for the benefit of patients and consumers.

From July 2018 through mid-2021, Greater Cannabis focused on commercializing its own and licensed technologies worldwide for transmucosal and transdermal delivery of legal medical or recreational cannabis (other than in the field of oral care) and cannabinoids (“CBD”) (. While part of the cannabis family, CBD, which contains less than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”), the psychoactive compound that produces the “high” in marijuana, is distinguished from cannabis by its use, physical appearance and lower THC concentration (cannabis generally has a THC level of 10% or more). The Company’s initial product was an oral transmucosal patch platform which for provides for loaded actives to be absorbed by the buccal mucosa into the body. Although the Company was able to launch the product and received some limited initial orders, Greater Cannabis management ultimately elected to pursue other opportunities which they believed offered the Company greater potential for growth and ultimate profitability.
 
Accordingly, on October 19, 2021 the Company entered into a license agreement with Shaare Zedek Scientific Ltd. (“SZS”), the technology transfer arm of Jerusalem’s Shaare Zedek Medical Center (SZMC). The license agreement covers the license of SZS’s novel cannabinoid therapeutic focused on treatment of autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Shaare Zedek Medical Center, founded in 1901, is one of the largest multidisciplinary research hospitals in Israel with 1,000 beds and over 850,000 patient visits a year. The SZMC Center for Research and Development has over 300 annual publications of investigator initiated studies in medical journals in addition to almost 160 clinical trials.
 
Accompanying the license agreement is a joint research and development agreement, which will focus on continuing the clinical program spearheaded by Dr. Adi Aran, M.D. Director of Pediatric Neurology at SZMC, Board Member of the Israeli Society for Pediatric Neurology, and co-inventor of the novel cannabinoid therapy. Dr. Aran is a world renowned expert in cannabis research and pediatric neurology and was the principal investigator of the first ever cannabis research study conducted on autistic children.
 
Dr. Aran’s pioneering study assessed safety, tolerability and efficacy of CBD based medical cannabis as an adjuvant therapy for refractory behavioral problems in children with ASD. The results provided very compelling evidence that medical cannabis is an effective therapy for children on the autism spectrum. Conditions in 80% of the children improved, with 62% of parents reporting substantial improvements. Half of the children had improved communication and 40% reported a decrease in anxiety. The same children had not shown improvement with conventional drug therapies. Dr. Aran and his team have now developed a novel combination therapy that is believed to be significantly more effective than the cannabis-only formulation that had been used in the aforementioned study. The Company will continue to further develop this therapeutic and conduct clinical studies to further substantiate its safety and efficacy beginning in neuropsychiatric disorders.


The clinical studies of the therapeutic are expected to require an investment of up to $1,000,000 and up to two years to finalize.
 
The Company’s business plan is to (i) conduct clinical studies on and commercialize the cannabinoid-based therapeutic and (ii) concentrate on cannabis related investment and development opportunities through direct equity investments, joint ventures, licensing agreements or acquisitions.

The Company is involved in additional research and development of innovative delivery systems. The Company expects to develop new formulations around cannabinoid delivery and intends to file more patents to protect the intellectual property resulting from that R&D. To support these efforts, the Company will allocate additional funds of approximately $250,000 from financing proceeds to research and development, sample productions, laboratory and clinical studies.
Government Regulation
 
General
 
Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”) and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) defines Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA in those states which have legalized medicinal and/or recreational use of cannabis, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
Notwithstanding the CSA, as of the date of this prospectus, 36 states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana in some capacity. Additionally, 17 states and the District of Colombia have approved the implementation of legal recreational marijuana use. Such state and territorial laws are in conflict with the federal CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal at the federal level.
 
In light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. For example, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration, James M. Cole, issued a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) provided guidelines (the “FinCEN Guidelines”) on February 14, 2014, regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act obligations).

During the Trump administration, there had been indications of potential change in cannabis-related policies, including a memo issued by then Attorney General Jeff Sessions in January 2018, although no formal action was ever taken. Although we expect this policy to continue under the Biden administration, there can be no assurance that will be the case. Accordingly, until there are formal changes in Federal cannabis-related enforcement policies, we intend to remain within the guidelines outlined in the Cole Memo and the FinCEN Guidelines where applicable; however, we cannot provide assurance that we are in full compliance with the Cole Memo, the FinCEN Guidelines or any applicable federal laws or regulations.
 
Cole Memo
 
Because of the discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from federal law that prohibits any such activities, DOJ Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued the Cole Memo concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. The Cole Memo guidance applies to all of the DOJ’s federal enforcement activity, including civil enforcement and criminal investigations and prosecutions, concerning cannabis in all states.
 
The Cole Memo reiterates Congress’s determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of cannabis is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo notes that the DOJ is committed to enforcement of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also notes that the DOJ is committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provides guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities (the “Enforcement Priorities”) in preventing:
 

● | the distribution of cannabis to minors; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels; 
● | the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; 
● | state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
● | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; 
● | drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use; 
● | the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and 
● | cannabis possession or use on federal property. 

 
We intend to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in and ensure that our activities do not interfere with any of the Enforcement Priorities set forth in the Cole Memo.
 
The Cole Memo is meant only as a guide for United States Attorneys and does not alter in any way the Department of Justice’s authority to enforce Federal law, including Federal laws relating to cannabis, regardless of state law.

Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018
 
The federal Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, signed into law on December 20, 2018, along with the Agricultural Act of 2014, the corresponding Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 provisions (as extended by resolution into 2018) and related state law, provide for the cultivation, processing, manufacturing and sale of hemp-derived products, as part of agricultural pilot programs and/or state plans adopted by individual states, including Colorado. However, there can be no assurance that new legislation or regulations may be introduced at either the federal and/or state level which, if passed, would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on the manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution and sale of hemp-derived products. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation, elimination or relabeling of certain products to meet new standards and revisions to certain sales and marketing materials and it is possible that the costs of complying with these new regulatory requirements could be material.
FDA
 
The use of our technology may be subject to pre-approval by the FDA for certain applications, or equivalent regulatory body approval in other jurisdictions. If so, obtaining FDA and other approvals will require a substantial investment of funds and may take years. In such case, we intend to rely on our sublicensees or strategic partners to fund and undertake any required approval process. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully obtain any such required regulatory approvals needed to enter certain markets or market our technology for certain applications.
 
We also may be required to comply with FDA and other federal, state and foreign regulations regarding safety, dosing and other similar matters.
 
Employees
 
We have one person providing us services on a full-time basis, our chief executive officer.
