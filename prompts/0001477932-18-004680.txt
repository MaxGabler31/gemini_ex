Forward Looking Statements
 
This annual report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “should”, “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions.
 
While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested in this report. Except as required by applicable law, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.
 
As used in this annual report, the terms "we", "us" and "our" mean Leafbuyer Technologies, Inc., unless otherwise indicated.
 
Transition Period
 
On March 23, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved a change in the Company's fiscal year end from December 31 to June 30, effective immediately. In connection with this change, we previously filed a Transition Report on Form 10-KT to report the results of the six-month transition period from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017. In this Annual Report, the periods presented are the year ended June 30, 2018, the six-month transition period from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017 (which we sometimes refer to as the "transition period ended June 30, 2017") and the year ended December 31, 2016 (which we sometimes refer to as "fiscal”). For comparison purposes, we have also included unaudited data for the year ended June 30, 2017.
Business Overview
 
Leafbuyer.com Platform
 
LB Media Group, LLC introduced Leafbuyer.com in 2013 as a consumer portal that would allow cannabis consumers to find the best deals and information from their favorite local dispensary. The platform also allowed cannabis businesses to attract new customers by posting more information and better cannabis deals. As the market has matured and our clients have become more sophisticated, their needs have expanded. The Company is now focused on developing multiple technology solutions to help our customers achieve their objectives. Resources are being put into broadening the platform in several key features. The fully-developed Leafbuyer platform will host many tools for our clients to attract, retain and grow customers. We plan to expand the platform into a full-service solution that can be monetized while also providing an industry best consumer experience.
 
The current market is extremely fragmented and there are few significant companies that have achieved scale in operations. We plan to grow organically and through strategic acquisitions to achieve our long-term goals.

The Team
 
The Company has 25 full-time employees. In addition, the company currently has sales teams in Washington, California and Oregon. Leafbuyer also has relationships with approximately 23 independent contractors which it retains from time to time.
 
A majority of our employees are involved in sales and customer service. Other services, such as website content and graphics design are outsourced to independent contractors.
 
One of the Company’s top priorities in 2018 has been recruiting and retaining some of the top talent in the cannabis and technology industries. We anticipate a majority of our future hiring will be in markets outside of Colorado.
 
Growth State by State
 
Our primary customers have been legal cannabis dispensaries and companies who create cannabis-related products. As more states legalize cannabis, we hope the consumer and potential customer base will expand. We believe that the transformation in California from a purely medical legal state to a recreational state will create great opportunities for our company. We intend to duplicate the model that has worked for us in Colorado in each market as it develops.
 
The marginal cost for Leafbuyer to enter a market is minimal in comparison to growers or retail operations. In order for us to enter a new market, most of our costs include sales and marketing personnel and grassroots efforts to grow the consumer base in the new market. We believe that we can replicate our success in Colorado in the past four years of operations in other states that adopt legal cannabis use. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so.
 
Other companies who deal with cannabis directly have significant legal and capital barriers impeding their growth into another state. However, since we are an ancillary company, most of the current regulations and strict cannabis laws do not pertain to our operations. Because of the overall growth in the market and low legal barriers, we believe that growth opportunities are very significant for the foreseeable future.
 
2018 and Beyond
 
On November 8, 2016, voters in California, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts voted to regulate the production and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes while Florida, North Dakota, Arkansas and Montana voters authorized its medical use. According to ArcView Market Research, these initiatives will cause the regulated cannabis industry to expand from roughly $6 billion in 2016 to more than $23 billion once these initiatives take effect.
 
In October of 2018 Canada will be the second country in the world to legalize recreational marijuana. The company is exploring partnerships in Canada and the potential for possibly future financing opportunities.
 
Our business model is designed to benefit from this trend. When a new state passes a medical or recreational cannabis law, we can start marketing to consumers and businesses in that state with minimal marginal cost. Because Leafbuyer is not involved in the production or sale of cannabis, we do not have to build expensive grow operations and open brick and mortar stores. As more states pass laws to offer legal cannabis products, we begin marketing into the state and sign up dispensaries to be on the platform.
 
We plan to grow the company organically through the aggressive deployment of sales and marketing resources into legal cannabis states. We understand that to become a significant player in the industry in the future will require us to look for acquisitions for a significant portion of that growth. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and acquire such opportunities or that they will be on terms that are favorable to the Company.
