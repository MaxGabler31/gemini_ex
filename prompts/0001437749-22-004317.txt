Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Background
 
We were formed as a Delaware corporation on June 20, 2014 for the purpose of engaging in the business of recycling metals through a novel, proprietary and patent-pending process that we developed and named “AquaRefining”. Since our formation, we have focused our efforts initially on the development and testing of our AquaRefining process for lead acid batteries, or LAB, and advanced that process by building a demonstration plant located in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center in McCarran, Nevada (“TRIC”). We also have developed a business plan which includes equipment supply services and licensing of the AquaRefining technology to recyclers and began research and development on using the AquaRefining process on lithium ion batteries (LIB) at our Innovation Center also located at TRIC.
 
We completed the development of our first LAB recycling facility at TRIC and commenced production of battery breaking and limited operations during the first quarter of 2017. From April 2017 through April 2018, we commenced the shipment of products for sale, consisting of lead compounds as well as plastics and limited production of lead bullion, including AquaRefined lead. During 2018, we commenced the sale of pure AquaRefined lead in the form of two tonne blocks and AquaRefined lead in the form of battery manufacturing ready ingots. In November 2018, we received official vendor certification from Clarios for our AquaRefined lead and commenced shipments directly to Clarios owned and partner battery manufacturing facilities. In 2019, we operated our demonstration AquaRefinery at commercial quantity production levels and produced over 35,000 AquaRefined ingots by operating the AquaRefinery twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week for sustained periods of time. The AquaRefining Aqualyzers in operation ran sustained endurance runs for over one month several times.
 
In order to expand the demonstration AquaRefinery to its full capacity, we chose to idle the AquaRefinery beginning in September 2019 to facilitate contracting work required to increase the plant capacity planned for late 2019 or early 2020. On the evening of November 29, 2019, a fire occurred in the AquaRefining area of the recycling facility at TRIC. The cause of the fire was not due to the technology or process of AquaRefining but rather to contracting activities. The Company and the insurance carriers agreed on a total claim of $30.25 million which was paid in full by the carriers. Plant clean-up and repair of fire damaged areas began in 2021 and were substantially completed by the end of the year. 
 
Following the November 2019 fire, we have been engaged in the pursuit of our business strategy that is based on the pursuit of licensing opportunities within the lead battery recycling marketplace. We believe our  business strategy will require less space and less equipment and focus on the needs of our future licensees. The capital light strategy is based on the pursuit of licensing opportunities within the battery recycling marketplace without maintaining and operating a capital-intensive battery recycling facility. Our capital light business strategy is designed to optimize shareholder value by focusing on equipment supply and licensing opportunities, which have always been a core part of our business plans. 
 
Our strategy also includes an expansion into lithium-ion battery recycling. In addition to research and development work, we enhanced our strategy by investing in LINICO Corporation (“LINICO”). We reached a lease-to-buy agreement with LINICO for the Aqua Metals' AquaRefining facility. In February 2021, we announced a strategic investment in LINICO Corporation of up to $2 million to be paid in Aqua Metals shares and cash for a 10% ownership in LINICO as part of our strategy to strengthen growth by potentially applying AquaRefining intellectual property to lithium-ion battery recycling while meeting our lead recycling commercial guidance.
 
Part of the efforts related to our business plan during 2020 and 2021 included additional improvements related to our existing technology. During the first half of 2020, we successfully performed test runs on the first and second iterations of our Aqualyzer as part of our V1.25L program. The program consisted of three iterations that were classified as V1.25a, V1.25b and the final iteration, V1.25L. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed our V1.25L Aqualyzer program on time and under budget, achieving lead production that is 100% greater compared to the V1.0 Aqualyzer deployed at the AquaRefinery during commercial production in 2018 and 2019. In August 2021, we announced the completion of the V1.5 Aqualyzer. This latest Aqualyzer configuration has now achieved lead production that is over 300% greater than the V1.0 Aqualyzer deployed at the AquaRefinery during commercial production in 2018 and 2019. These results are expected to positively impact capital and operating expenses for the Company’s equipment supply and technology licensing customers. The increase in throughput results in a reduction of more than 60% in the number of Aqualyzers needed for equivalent lead production delivered by the V1.0 model, reducing capital and labor and footprint requirements. This latest iteration has also increased electrical efficiency to 97%, which further improves operating costs. In July 2021, we signed our first agreement with ACME Metal Enterprise to deploy AquaRefining technology and equipment which was shipped in early January 2022 to commence the implementation.  ACME Metal Enterprise has long running relationships supplying specialized alloys to some of the largest battery manufacturers in the world based in the APAC region.  One of the goals of the deployment is to further advance a direct to oxide battery manufacturing process which would eliminate the costly and energy intensive melting and ingotization process and rather take that ultrapure material right from the Aqualyzers to battery oxide production.  We believe that our AquaRefining technology is a commercially attractive proposition in the hands of battery recyclers, who also typically have access to lower cost feedstock, established offtake contracts and ability to process all materials on site.
 
In August 2021, we announced that we had established an Innovation Center focused on applying our proven technology to lithium-ion battery recycling research and development and prototype system activities. Our strategic decision to apply our proven clean, closed-loop hydrometallurgical and electro-chemical recycling experience to lithium-ion battery recycling is designed to meet the growing demand for critical metals driven by the global transition to electric vehicles, growth in Internet data centers, and alternative energy applications including solar, wind, and grid-scale storage. 
 
In November 2021, Aqua Metals and LINICO signed a collaboration agreement which sets the parameters for future research and development cooperation, as both companies expand into lithium-ion battery recycling and advance our technologies designed to recycle lithium-ion batteries cost-effectively and sustainably. Aqua Metals and LINICO plan to source the necessary lithium-ion feedstock from battery manufacturing scrap and end-of-life cells from various sources, including electric vehicle battery suppliers interested in participating in the eco-network the two companies announced in 2021. LINICO will process the feedstock into high-quality black mass utilizing its proprietary process. The resulting black mass will be used as input feedstock for Aqua Metals’ AquaRefining pilot cells intended to create high purity metals such as nickel, cobalt, and copper as well as other compounds.

Overview
 
Aqua Metals is seeking to reinvent lead and other metal recycling with its patented and patent pending AquaRefining™ technology. Aqua Metals is focused on developing cleaner and safer metals recycling through innovation. We believe our Innovation Center can expand the development of breakthrough technologies for sustainable metal recycling that can deliver high-value critical minerals back into the manufacturing supply chain while reducing emissions and toxic byproducts and creating much safer work environments.
 
Unlike smelting, AquaRefining is a room temperature, water-based process. Aqua Metals has invested in breakthrough metals recycling methodologies that we believe are environmentally responsible, economically competitive, and will help retain critical strategic metals within the U.S. while lowering reliance on unsafe and toxic mining operations. Since 2015, Aqua Metals has developed breakthrough metal recycling technologies that utilize a clean, closed-loop process that can produce ultra-high purity metal. AquaRefining delivers raw materials back into the manufacturing supply chain while reducing emissions and toxic byproducts and creating a safer work environment. The patented AquaRefining modular systems have already demonstrated how they can reduce environmental impact and scale lead-acid battery recycling capacity.
 
AquaRefining for lead uses a bio-degradable aqueous solvent and a novel ambient temperature electro-chemical process to produce lead suitable for use in LAB production. Our AquaRefining process produces lead with a purity of 99.996+%, making it the purest lead ever made from a recycling technique that is in fact more pure than lead made from mining processes. We believe that AquaRefining can provide a more efficient production process as compared with alternative methods of producing equivalent grades of lead. For example, licensing the technology to facilities closest to the source of used LABs is more efficient due to minimization of transportation costs and supply chain bottlenecks. On this basis, we believe that AquaRefining reduces environmental plant emissions, health concerns and permitting needs compared with lead smelting. We believe that the combined advantages offered by AquaRefining represent a potential step change in lead recycling technology that includes improved product quality, advantages in footprint and logistics as well as reduced environmental impact.
 
The modular nature of AquaRefining makes it possible both to start LAB recycling at a smaller scale than is possible with a typical smelter setup and to add AquaRefining to existing battery recycling operations to expand production capacity or to reduce smelting processes. Our plan is to pursue the licensing of our AquaRefining technology. This strategy is designed to supply AquaRefining and supporting equipment to battery recyclers to improve emissions, throughput, and product quality from their battery recycling operations.
 
Our Markets
 
The Lead Market
 
Lead is a globally traded metal commodity and is the essential component of over 80% of the world’s rechargeable batteries. Lead is globally traded primarily on the London Metals Exchange (LME), although the smaller Shanghai Metals Exchange (SHME) in China also trades the element. Conventionally in the industry, there are two separate groupings of lead: i) primary lead which refers to lead produced at primary smelters that use mined lead concentrates (generally lead sulfide) as their major feedstock, and ii) secondary lead which refers to lead smelters utilizing LABs as their main feed source.
 
Originally, the majority of the lead used in batteries was sourced from primary smelters but in recent decades, secondary lead has grown to become the dominate product used. Industry data shows that six million metric tons of lead was produced in 1995, of which approximately 45% was from primary and 55% was from secondary sources. Twenty years later, by 2015, global lead production had increased to approximately 11 million metric tons, of which more than 65% was secondary. Importantly, primary lead production had increased only marginally during this period. This marginal increase is partially due to lead-zinc mine deposits being depleted across the globe in existing mines. As such, an increasing quantity of primary lead is now the predominate byproduct of zinc mining. In recent years, tightening emissions regulations have forced many U.S. smelters to close. 
 
Lead is an integral component in over a billion electrical storage devices used across the globe, including every car and truck, hybrid and electric vehicle. Lead-based batteries provide backup power for hospitals, electrify households, and are the primary energy storage mode for buildings, data centers, and telecom. Lead is a finite resource with rising demand. The lead acid battery market is expected to grow from $46.6 billion in 2015 to $85.5 billion in 2025. Lead batteries are currently the only 100% recyclable batteries available and 80% of the lead used to manufacture new batteries is recycled.
 
As noted above, although lead is traded as a commodity on the LME/SHME, the major sales are directly between producers/traders and users (whom are typically battery manufacturers). The LME daily price is used as the benchmark in forming the basis of physical trades, forward contracts, and hedge strategies for both primary and secondary lead. Based on market and product knowledge with buyers of lead in the U.S. and Global lead markets, different grades (termed alloys) of lead are traded at a premium to the base LME price. Lead alloys, which are generally specifically designed for the customer, are also sold at a premium above the base LME, whereas byproducts (generally lead compounds or scrap) are traded at a discount to the LME as they are based on the lead content and its form. 
 

Lead Smelting
 
Currently, smelters produce virtually all the world’s mined and recycled lead. Smelting is an energy-intensive and, in some poorly managed plants, a highly polluting process. At its core, smelting is a relatively high temperature (excess of 900°C) metallurgical reduction process in which lead compounds are heated and reacted with various reducing agents to remove the oxygen, sulfur, and other impurities. The process leaves behind bullion lead and waste slag. In smelting, depending upon the operation, 0.5% to 5% of the lead can be lost to the “slag”, with the resultant lead bullion containing both wanted and unwanted impurities.
 
In developed countries, there is both increased environmental regulation and enforcement of such, including monitoring of permissible blood lead levels in employees and local populations. These regulations and the increasing enforcement have made it more expensive to operate smelters. According to a report titled “Hazardous Trade?” produced by the Secretariat of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation in 2013, this has led to a decline of lead smelters in the U.S., an expansion of smelting operations in Mexico and a resultant increase in the export of used LABs from the U.S. followed by the re-import of recycled lead. This trade is believed to be largely driven by the lower costs related to the less stringent environmental standards and enforcement in Mexico. For the foregoing reasons, we believe that lead smelting facilities are increasingly located in less regulated areas remote from both the source of used LABs and the demand for lead. We believe that the remote location of smelting increases the transport costs to the production of recycled lead.

Lead Acid Batteries
 
Although the LAB is one of the earliest battery technologies, in terms of energy capacity deployed and installed manufacturing capacity, it still dominates the battery industry today. Historically, the largest market for LABs has been as starter batteries for vehicles. However, with the increasing electrical load on modern vehicles and the adoption of additional “Stop-Start” conventional 12V “starter batteries”, LABs are evolving into more capable and higher value products. At the same time, large new markets such as Cell Tower, Data Center and Industrial back-up are adding to demand. Consequently, existing LAB production facilities are being expanded and new facilities are being built.
 
According to Grand View Research, annual lead acid battery sales are expected to nearly double to $84 billion by 2025, driving demand for lead. Similar prospects for healthy growth in the lead industry continue to be published and support continued growth in demand for lead for at least the next 20 years. We believe that grid storage and other energy storage applications linked to renewable energy (solar and wind) will also generate increased demand for LABs, where low cost, safety and reliability will make them attractive options.
 
The increase in LAB manufacturing in general and particularly in China, India, and Southeast Asia, has increased demand for lead, putting pressure on global recycling networks to meet this demand. At present, we believe that much of the LAB recycling performed outside of the U.S., Canada, the EU, Japan, and Australia is carried out in outdated facilities with poor environmental standards and insufficient enforcement. China, India, Pakistan, and South America appear to be moving toward tougher regulation and enforcement. We believe that this will drive a demand in foreign markets for less polluting LAB recycling processes.
 
The Lithium Battery Market
 
 According to our sources, including Goldman Sachs, the global lithium-ion battery market was assessed at approximately USD $ 9   billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.0% from 2020 to 2028. The growth of the market is being driven by the growing demand for the lithium-ion battery in Electric Vehicles (EVs) and grid storage which offers lightweight high-energy density solutions. The market is also being influenced by increased registration of EVs and a reduction in the price of the lithium-ion battery. Costs have been driven down a long way since 2010, when battery prices were $1,100/kWh, representing a 90% drop over ten years to about $110/kWh today. Rechargeable battery technologies are becoming key to moving from a fossil-fuel driven economy to an electrified world powered by renewable energy that can be stored.

More than 15 million tons of lithium-ion batteries are expected to retire between now and 2030. All major car manufacturers are working on providing electric vehicles and some are moving most of the future production to electric only vehicles.
 
Lithium Batteries
 
EV batteries are powered by a battery pack made up of individual cells. Each cell has 4 components: the cathode, anode, separator, and electrolyte. Lithium-ion batteries use different raw materials for each of the components. The most common material used for the anode is graphite. The most widely used metals for the cathode is metal oxides that are combinations of lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and aluminum. The electrolyte is generally made using acidic salts and solvents such as sulfuric acid and there are also solid-state silicon based alternatives on the horizon. The separator is usually created using a porous, polyolefin material like polyethylene or polypropylene.
 
Lithium-ion battery recycling is the method of taking EV batteries and splitting it into its components, ultimately into the original raw materials (lithium, nickel, cobalt, etc.) that can be reused in new batteries. While making lithium-ion batteries for EVs is important to address climate change, the batteries themselves are harmful to the environment if left in landfills or burned. Currently, 5-7% of lithium-ion batteries are recycled and that must get close to 100% both to avoid another environmental catastrophe and to recapture the critical minerals in those spent batteries to feed the massive demand growth curve.  Battery recycling helps address this problem, but current pyro-based battery recycling technology (smelting) also creates harmful emissions, potentially creating new climate problems faster than they are being solved. There are alternative hydro-based technologies being attempted but they are not yet proven and rely on older methodologies that are known to create significant waste streams which have their own negative environmental and economic impacts.
 
AquaRefining Process
 
We developed AquaRefining to be a cleaner and modular alternative to smelting. Our process has two key elements, both of which are integral to our issued patents and pending-patent applications. The first is our use of a proprietary, non-toxic solvent that dissolves lead compounds. The second is a proprietary electro-chemical process and Aqualyzer that converts the dissolved lead compounds into high purity lead through a continuous process that is suitable for use in next generation LAB production.
 
The AquaRefining process begins with the processing of crushed used batteries either in the form of paste (for LAB) or, in the future, black mass (for LIB). The active materials are first processed to remove sulfur and then dissolved in our solvent. Metals are plated from the solvent using our patented and patent-pending process allowing the solvent to be reused.
 
Our AquaRefining process can generate lead and lead-based products, including high purity lead, lead alloys and lead compounds which are primarily intended for the LAB industry. We are also exploring higher value lead-based products which may offer performance and life-cycle benefits to the LAB industry. We also believe that our AquaRefining process can be used to generate metals, such as nickel and cobalt from lithium-ion recycled batteries.
 
A significant benefit of our AquaRefining process is that it is capable of producing higher yields of higher purity thus higher value product than that derived from primary smelters with product from secondary sources. As indicated above, primary grade lead is generally sold directly to battery companies.
 
Another significant benefit of our process is that we designed our AquaRefining equipment to be manufactured on a purpose-built production line in standard sized Aqualyzers. This is not possible with the smelting process, as smelters need to be constructed on site. This gives us the ability to provide AquaRefining systems with capacities ranging from eight metric tons per day to more than 800 metric tons per day all based on our recently enhanced standard Aqualyzer. We have also developed an integrated software and portal called PureMetrics that keeps track of lead production and key operating metrics.
 
Lead recycling is subject to a variety of domestic and international regulations related to hazardous materials, emissions, employee safety and other matters. While our operations will be subject to these regulations, we believe that one of our potential advantages will be our ability to conduct battery recycling operations with less regulatory cost and burden than smelting operators due to the nature of our process. One of our key initiatives is and will be to educate regulators and the public as to the environmental benefits of AquaRefining. We believe that we have the potential to develop a business model that offers the opportunity to conduct, in an environmentally friendly manner, an important recycling activity that historically has been conducted in an often highly polluting manner.

Our Business Model
 
Overall, our objective is to progress the lead and lithium-ion recycling industry from one which is based solely on smelting to one which is either supplemented or produced solely by AquaRefining. The business model that we are currently most focused on is the supply of AquaRefining and supporting equipment and services to third parties to use in their recycling operations on a licensing model with running royalties to Aqua Metals for lead and other battery metals produced. We are currently focused on licensing our technology for lead and developing our solution for lithium-ion batteries.
 
The market for lead and other lithium-ion batteries are global in scale but local in nature and execution, with large differences in local regulation, custom and practice, and access to transportation and electricity costs. In some regions, it is highly regulated, and in others it is not. Consequently, we are evolving our business model to commercialize our technology optimally across multiple locations.
 
In the U.S. and similarly regulated countries, our plan is to supply AquaRefining technology to battery recycling facilities, both directly and in association with third parties through joint ventures, licensing, and direct sales. We intend to license our lead battery technology to multiple existing battery recyclers. For example, in July 2021 we signed our first agreement with ACME Metal Enterprise to deploy AquaRefining technology and equipment which was shipped in early January 2022 to commence the implementation. We intend to continue to develop our Aqua Refining technology for the recycling of lithium-ion batteries and the licensing of such technology to parties in the LIB industry. In August 2021, we announced that we had established an Innovation Center focused on applying our proven technology to lithium-ion battery recycling research and development and prototype system activities. Our strategic decision to apply our proven clean, closed-loop hydrometallurgical and electro-chemical recycling experience to lithium-ion battery recycling is designed to meet the growing demand for critical metals driven by the global transition to electric vehicles, growth in Internet data centers, and alternative energy applications including solar, wind, and grid-scale storage. In November 2021, Aqua Metals and LINICO signed a collaboration agreement which sets the parameters for future research and development cooperation, as both companies’ expand into lithium-ion battery recycling and advance our technologies designed to recycle lithium-ion batteries cost-effectively and sustainably. Aqua Metals and LINICO plan to source the necessary lithium-ion feedstock from battery manufacturing scrap and end-of-life cells from various sources, including electric vehicle battery suppliers interested in participating in the eco-network the two companies announced in 2021. LINICO will process the feedstock into high-quality black mass utilizing its proprietary process. The resulting black mass will be used as input feedstock for Aqua Metals’ AquaRefining pilot cells intended to create high purity metals such as nickel, cobalt, and copper as well as other compounds.
 
Competition
 
At the present time, our primary competition in the production of lead comes from operators of existing smelters and other parties heavily invested in the existing supply chain for smelting. Our approach to this competition is to make AquaRefining available for the conversion of existing smelter-based facilities. However, it is prudent to assume that outside of our strategic relationships, a conversion to AquaRefining may be resisted by some of the incumbent lead producers. Competition in the supply of lead from such incumbents may come in the form of price competition for lead produced. However, to the extent we are successful with partners in being a producer of high-quality lead without the regulatory costs or burden associated with smelting, we believe that we may be able to compete effectively with smelting as the preferred method of recycling lead, particularly in the more regulated jurisdictions where environmental and worker safety practices are evolving towards improving both conditions.
 
Secondary competition comes from other alternatives to lead smelting that are electro-chemical based. There are a few groups that have run lab scale and bench tests but to date, no alternate technology has been commercialized to produce large quantities of consistent quality lead whereas Aqua Metals has already done so.
 
Our development of recycling technology for lithium-ion batteries is a unique approach to extracting the high-value metals compared to the array of other potential solutions under development. Currently, smelting is the only commercially proven process for recycling Lithium-ion batteries. The smelting process utilizes multiple high emissions steps to produce battery ready materials. Over the next decade and beyond, when the volume of used batteries becomes significant, smelting will likely not be a viable solution due to the negative environmental impact and likelihood of regulatory restrictions on emissions. The other technologies currently under development utilize a predominately hydrometallurgical approach that consumes significant amounts of chemicals to extract the metals resulting in high cost and excessive waste streams. Our approach is a hybrid of hydrometallurgical and electrowinning processes similar to the process we have commercialized for lead, we call it “Li AquaRefining”. We believe, and early R&D supports, that Li AquaRefining requires less chemicals, produces less waste streams, and creates higher purity products at a lower cost as compared to both smelting and standard hydrometallurgy.
 
The lithium-ion battery recycling market is significantly different from that of the lead recycling market in that it is a nascent industry. With no predominant technology to displace, our goal is to enable new and existing recyclers across the globe with Li AquaRefining as a best-in-class solution for meeting the supply chain demands of the lithium-ion battery industry as well as meeting the environmental needs of the planet and the corporations seeking to achieve net zero emissions.
 
Licensing of our Technology
 
Our recycling facility located at Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center was used in the previous years to prove out our AquaRefining process. During this time, we began continuous production of AquaRefined lead and sold it at a premium to the London Metals Exchange ("LME"). We also received approved lead supplier status from Clarios, and we shipped approximately 35,000 ingots directly to their battery manufacturing facility. We have invested over $200 million towards commercialization, with 82 patents issued or allowed and 54 patent applications pending in the U.S. and internationally for lead and other metals.
 
In July 2021, we signed our first agreement with ACME Metal Enterprise to deploy AquaRefining technology and equipment, which was shipped in early January 2022 to commence the implementation. We believe that our AquaRefining technology will be a commercially attractive proposition in the hands of battery recyclers, who typically have access to lower cost feedstock and ability to process all materials on site through a furnace.
 
We have been engaged in the pursuit of a business strategy that is based on the pursuit of licensing opportunities within the lead battery recycling marketplace without maintaining and operating a capital-intensive lead recycling facility. Our capital light business strategy is designed to optimize shareholder value by focusing on equipment supply and licensing opportunities, which have always been a core part of our business plans. We believe this path has the potential to maximize shareholder value in that it could be far less capital intensive than a plant rebuild.
 
Revenues related to the licensing of our technology may include engineering services, equipment supply and recurring running royalties on lead production.

Intellectual Property Rights
 
We regard the protection of our technologies and intellectual property rights as an important element of our business operations and crucial to our success. We endeavor to generate and protect our intellectual property assets through a series of patents, trademarks, internal and external policy and procedures and contractual provisions.
Patent Portfolio
 
Currently, we have secured 8 US patents, 63 international patents, and 3 allowances (two international, one US). In addition to the US patents, we have international patents/allowances in the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization, African Intellectual Property Organization, Australia, Canada, Chile, China, the Eurasian Patent Organization, European Union, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, South Korea, South Africa, Ukraine, and Vietnam. We also have 56 US and foreign patent applications pending with patent applications pending in 21 additional non-US jurisdictions across eight distinct patent applications relating to certain elements of the technology underlying our AquaRefining process and related apparatus and chemical formulations. The claims of the granted patents substantially address the same subject matter and are drawn to various aspects of processing lead materials using an aqua refining process. Differences in the claim number and scope are due to local rules and practice.
 
We intend to continue to prepare and file domestic and foreign patent applications covering expanding aspects and applications of our technology, as circumstances warrant.
 
There can be no assurance that any patents will issue from any of our current or any future applications. Also, any patents that may issue may not survive a legal challenge to their scope, validity, or enforceability, or provide significant protection for us. Competitors may work around our patents, so they are not infringing. Our patent portfolio and our existing policy and procedures safeguarding our trade secrets nonetheless may face challenges so that our competitors can copy our AquaRefining process.

Trade Secrets and Contract Protection
 
We have developed our internal policy and procedures in safeguarding our trade secrets and proprietary information. Our procedures generally require our employees, consultants, and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except under specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements provide that all of the technology that is conceived by the individual during the course of employment is our exclusive property. The development of our technology and many of our processes are dependent upon the knowledge, experience, and skills of key scientific and technical personnel.
Government Regulation
 
Our operations and the operations of our licensees in the United States will be subject to the federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws applicable to the reclamation of LABs and Lithium based batteries. While the reclamation process itself is generally not subject to federal permitting requirements, depending on how any particular operation is structured, our facilities and the facilities of our licensees may have to obtain environmental permits or approvals from federal, state or local regulators to operate, including permits or regulatory approvals related to air emissions, water discharges, waste management, and the storage of batteries on-site should that become necessary. We may face opposition from local residents or public interest groups to the installation and operation of our or our licensee's facilities. Failure to secure (or significant delays in securing) the necessary approvals could prevent us from pursuing some of our planned operations and adversely affect our business, financial results, and growth prospects.
 
In addition to permitting requirements, our operations and the operations of our licensees are subject to environmental health, safety and transportation laws and regulations that govern the management of and exposure to hazardous materials such as the lead, acids, and other metals involved in reclamation. These include hazard communication and other occupational safety requirements for employees, which may mandate industrial hygiene monitoring of employees for potential exposure to lead. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject our business to significant penalties (civil or criminal) and other sanctions that could adversely affect our business. Changes to these regulatory requirements in the future could also increase our costs, require changes in or cessation of certain activities, and adversely affect the business.
 
The nature of our operations and the operations of our licensees involves risks, including the potential for exposure to hazardous materials such as lead, that could result in personal injury and property damage claims from third parties, including employees and neighbors, which claims could result in significant costs or other environmental liability. Our operations and the operations of our licensees also pose a risk of releases of hazardous substances, such as lead, acids, and other metals related to lithium batteries into the environment, which can result in liabilities for the removal or remediation of such hazardous substances from the properties at which they have been released, liabilities which can be imposed regardless of fault, and our business could be held liable for the entire cost of cleanup even if we were only partially responsible. Like any manufacturer, we and our licensees are also subject to the possibility that we may receive notices of potential liability in connection with materials that were sent to third-party recycling, treatment, and/or disposal facilities under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), and comparable state statutes, which impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination, and for damages to natural resources. Liability under CERCLA is retroactive, and, under certain circumstances, liability for the entire cost of a cleanup can be imposed on any responsible party.
 
As our business expands outside of the United States, our licensed operations will be subject to the environmental, health and safety laws of the countries where we do business, including permitting and compliance requirements that address the similar risks as do the laws in the United States, as well as international legal requirements such as those applicable to the transportation of hazardous materials. Depending on the country or region, these laws could be as stringent as those in the US, or they could be less stringent or not as strictly enforced. In some countries in which we are interested in expanding our business, such as South America, Taiwan and China, the relevant environmental regulatory and enforcement frameworks are in flux and subject to change. Therefore, while compliance with these requirements will cause our business to incur costs, and failure to comply with these requirements could adversely affect our business, it is difficult to evaluate such potential costs or adverse impacts until such time as we decide to initiate operations in particular countries outside the United States.
