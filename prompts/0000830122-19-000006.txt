ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
PICO Holdings, Inc. is a holding company that was incorporated in 1981. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, PICO and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as “PICO,” the “Company,” or by words such as “we,” “us,” and “our.” Our business is primarily operated through our wholly owned subsidiary, Vidler Water Company, Inc. (“Vidler”).
Our objective is to maximize long-term shareholder value. Currently, we believe the highest potential return to shareholders is from a return of capital. As we monetize assets, we intend to return capital back to shareholders through a stock repurchase program or by other means such as special dividends. We may, from time to time, reinvest a portion of proceeds from asset monetizations in further development of existing assets if we believe the returns on such reinvestment outweigh the benefits of a return of capital.

Our Business
We are primarily focused on monetizing our existing water rights and storage credits that we own in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico. The long-term future demand for our existing water assets is driven by population and economic growth relative to currently available water supplies in the southwestern United States. We have developed sources of water for municipal and industrial use, either from existing supplies of water, such as water used for agricultural purposes, acquired unappropriated (previously unused) water, or discovered new water sources based on science and targeted exploration. We are not a water utility, and do not currently intend to enter into regulated utility activities.
A water right is the legal right to divert water and put it to beneficial use. Water rights are real property rights which can be bought and sold and are commonly measured in acre-feet (“AF”), which is a measure of the volume of water required to cover an area of one acre to a depth of one foot and is equal to 325,850 gallons. The value of a water right depends on a number of factors, which may include location, the seniority of the right, whether or not the right is transferable, or if the water can be moved from one location to another. We believe we have purchased water rights at prices consistent with their then current use, which was typically agricultural in nature, with the expectation that the value would increase as we converted the water rights through the development process to a higher use, such as municipal and industrial use. We acquired and developed water resources with the expectation that such water resources would be the most competitive source of water (the most economical source of water supply) to support new growth in municipalities or new commercial and industrial projects.
Over the past eight years, the population growth of the states where we own water rights and storage credits has exceeded the national growth rate collectively and individually, with the exception of New Mexico. According to the Census Bureau’s estimate of state population changes for the period April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2018, Nevada’s growth rate was 12.4%, Arizona was 12.2%, Colorado was 13.2%, and New Mexico was 1.8%. These population growth statistics compare to the national total growth rate of 5.96% over the same period.
Historically, a significant portion of the Southwest’s water supplies have come from the Colorado River. The balance is provided by other surface rights, such as rivers and lakes, groundwater (water pumped from underground aquifers), and water previously stored in reservoirs or aquifers. Prolonged droughts (decreased snow pack runoff and the related decreased surface water) and rapid population growth in the past twenty years have exacerbated the region’s general water scarcity.
In December 2012, the U.S. Department of the Interior released a report titled: The Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study, examining the future water demands on the Colorado River Basin. The report projects water supply and demand imbalances throughout the Colorado River Basin and adjacent areas over the next 50 years. The average imbalance in future supply and demand is projected to be greater than 3.2 million acre-feet per year by 2060. The study projects that the largest increase in demand will come from municipal and industrial users as a result of population growth. The Colorado River Basin currently provides water to approximately 40 million people, and the study estimates that this number could nearly double to approximately 76.5 million people by 2060, under a rapid growth scenario.
Certain areas of the Southwest confronting long-term growth have insufficient known supplies of water to support their future economic and population growth. The inefficient allocation of available water between agricultural users and municipal or industrial users, the lack of available known water supplies in a particular location, or inadequate infrastructure to fully utilize or store existing and new water supplies provide opportunities for us to apply our water resource development expertise.
The development of our water assets required significant capital and expertise. A complete project, from acquisition, through development, permitting, and sale is typically a long-term endeavor. In the regions in which we operate, new housing and commercial and industrial developments require an assured, or sustainable, water supply (for example, in Arizona, access to water supplies for at least 100 years is required) before a permit for the development will be issued.
We have acquired or developed water rights and water related assets in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Colorado, and New Mexico. We also developed and operate our own water storage facility near Phoenix, Arizona, utilize water storage capacity operated by third parties in Arizona, and “bank,” or store water for future growth with municipalities in Nevada and New Mexico.
We have also entered into “teaming” and joint resource development arrangements with third parties who have water assets but lack the capital or expertise to commercially develop these assets. The first of these arrangements was a water delivery teaming agreement in southern Nevada with the Lincoln County Water District (“Lincoln/Vidler”), which is developing water resources in Lincoln County, Nevada. In northern Nevada, we have also entered into a joint development agreement with Carson City and Lyon County, Nevada to develop and provide water resources in Lyon County as well as a water banking agreement with Truckee Meadows Water Authority in Reno, Nevada.

We generate revenues by:

• | selling our developed water rights to real estate developers, power generating facilities or other commercial and industrial users who must secure rights to an assured, or sustainable, supply of water in order to receive permits for their development projects;


• | selling our developed water rights to water utilities, municipalities and other government agencies for their specific needs, including to support population and economic growth;


• | selling our stored water to state agencies, commercial developers or municipalities that have either exhausted their existing water supplies or require reserves for future water obligations, or, in instances where our water represents the most economical source of water, for their commercial projects or communities; and


• | leasing and selling of our water or land.

We owned the following significant water resource and water storage assets at December 31, 2018:
Fish Springs Ranch
We own a 51% membership interest in, and are the managing partner of, Fish Springs Ranch, LLC (“FSR”), which owns the Fish Springs Ranch and other properties totaling approximately 7,310 acres in Honey Lake Valley in Washoe County, Nevada approximately 40 miles north of Reno, Nevada. FSR also owns approximately 12,907 acre-feet of permitted water rights related to the properties of which 7,907 acre-feet are designated as water credits, transferable to other areas within Washoe County (such as Reno and Sparks) to support community development. Although the additional 5,000 AF has been approved and permitted by the Nevada State Engineer, existing federal rights of way will need to be updated before such water is transferable. To date, we have funded all of the operational expenses, development, and construction costs incurred in this partnership. Certain of the development and construction costs are treated as preferred capital under the partnership agreement which among other things, entitles us to receive interest on the initial balance of the preferred capital and the accumulated interest at the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 450 basis points. The preferred capital and accumulated interest is first in line to be paid out as the partnership generates sufficient revenue. At December 31, 2018 the balance in the preferred capital account, including $87.1 million of accrued interest, was $181.7 million and the associated interest rate was 7.31%.
During 2006, we started construction of a pipeline and an electrical substation to provide the power required to pump the water to the north valleys region of Reno. In July 2008, we completed construction of and dedicated our pipeline and associated infrastructure to Washoe County, Nevada under the terms of an Infrastructure Dedication Agreement (“IDA”) between Washoe County and FSR. Under the provisions of the IDA, Washoe County is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the pipeline and we own the exclusive right to the capacity of the pipeline to allow for the sale of water for future economic development in the north valley area of Reno. As of December 31, 2018, our remaining 7,907 acre-feet of water that has regulatory approval to be imported to the north valleys of Reno is available for sale under a Water Banking Trust Agreement entered into between FSR and Washoe County. Under the Water Banking Trust Agreement, Washoe County holds our water rights in trust. We can sell our water credits to developers, who must then dedicate the water to the local water utility for service. In December 2014, Washoe County Water Utilities merged with the Truckee Meadows Water Authority (“TMWA”), consolidating water supply service in Washoe County. Also effective at the end of 2014, FSR, Washoe County, and TMWA consented to the assignment of the Water Banking Trust Agreement and the IDA to the Truckee Meadows Water Authority.
The property is a working ranch and is comprised of 7,310 acres of land owned by us and approximately 180,000 acres of a Bureau of Land Management grazing allotment. The land and allotment are currently leased to a cattle company for grazing. The ranch also grows alfalfa hay and grass that is sold to cattle operators, dairies and feed stores. We have entered into an option agreement with a solar company to lease up to 2,600 acres for solar panels and battery storage.
Carson/Lyon
The capital of Nevada, Carson City, and Lyon County are located in the western part of the state, close to Lake Tahoe and the border with California. While Carson City’s housing growth has been and is expected to be minimal due to land constraints, there is planned growth for the Dayton corridor, directly east of Carson City. The planned growth in this area is anticipated to be driven by the employment growth at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (“TRIC”) and the construction of the extension of the USA Parkway, completed in August 2017, which connects Interstate route 80 to TRIC and to U.S. route 50 near Silver Springs, Lyon County. There are currently few existing water sources to support future growth and development in the Dayton corridor area and we have worked with Carson City and Lyon County for several years on ways to deliver water to support this expected growth.
 5

We have development and improvement agreements with both Carson City and Lyon County to provide water resources for planned future growth in Lyon County and to connect, or “intertie,” the municipal water systems of Carson City and Lyon County. The agreements allow for certain river water rights owned or controlled by us to be conveyed for use in Lyon County. The agreements also allow us to bank water with Lyon County and authorize us to build the infrastructure to upgrade and inter-connect the Carson City and Lyon County water systems.
We own or control water rights consisting of both Carson River agriculture designated water rights and certain municipal and industrial designated water rights. We anticipate that we will have up to approximately 3,500 acre-feet available for municipal use in Lyon County for future development, if and when demand occurs, principally by means of delivery through the new infrastructure we constructed.
Vidler Arizona Recharge Facility
We built and received the necessary permits to operate a full-scale water “recharge” facility that allowed us to bank water underground in the Harquahala Valley, Arizona. “Recharge” is the process of placing water into storage underground. When needed, the water will be “recovered,” or removed from storage, through groundwater wells. This stored water creates a long term storage credit (“LTSC”). The Arizona Department of Water Resources tracks and documents the LTSCs stored throughout Arizona. 
We recharged Colorado River water at this facility, which is a primary source of water for the Lower Basin States of Arizona, California, and Nevada. The water storage facility is strategically located adjacent to the Central Arizona Project (“CAP”) aqueduct, a conveyance canal running from Lake Havasu to Phoenix and Tucson. Our recharged water was purchased from surplus flows of CAP water. Proximity to the CAP aqueduct provides a competitive advantage as it minimizes the cost of water conveyance of our LTSCs. 
Potential users include industrial companies, power-generating companies, developers, and local governmental political subdivisions in Arizona, including municipalities and incorporated areas, and out-of-state users such as municipalities and water agencies in Nevada and California. The Arizona Water Banking Authority (“AWBA”) has the responsibility for intrastate and interstate storage of water for governmental entities. To date, we have not stored water at the facility for any third party and there is no longer excess water which can be banked.
While Arizona was the only southwestern state with surplus flows of Colorado River water available for storage, there is no surplus flows available to us as drought conditions have reduced the flow of the Colorado River and other water users have fully utilized their water allocations. In the future, we do not anticipate purchasing and storing surplus flows of Colorado River water and we have discontinued using the recharge element of the storage site. At December 31, 2018, we had LTSCs of approximately 250,600 acre-feet of water in storage at the facility. To date, we have not generated any revenue from selling our stored water at this facility.
Phoenix AMA Water Storage
As of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 53,600 acre-feet of LTSCs stored in the Phoenix Active Management Area (“AMA”), of which 13,445 AF are under agreements of purchase and sale by third parties expiring in December 2019 and November 2021. However, the buyers have the option to terminate the agreements with 10 days notice without any obligation to purchase any additional LTSCs. Water stored in the AMA may be recovered and used anywhere in the AMA and could have a variety of uses for residential and commercial developments within the Phoenix metropolitan area. All of the storage sites we utilize within the AMA are operated by third parties.
Harquahala Valley Ground Water Basin
Any new residential development in Arizona within an AMA must obtain a permit from the Arizona Department of Water Resources certifying a “designated assured water supply” sufficient to sustain the development for at least 100 years. Harquahala Valley groundwater meets the designation of assured water supply.
As of December 31, 2018, we owned 1,926 acres of land and have the ability to utilize 6,040 acre-feet of groundwater for development within the Harquahala Basin. The Analysis of Adequate Water Supply for the 6,040 acre-feet must be renewed before December 2021 in order to maintain these rights.

Lincoln County, Nevada Water Delivery and Teaming Agreement
Lincoln County Nevada (“Lincoln”) and Vidler entered into a water delivery teaming agreement to locate and develop water resources in Lincoln County, Nevada for planned projects under the Lincoln County master plan. Under the agreement, proceeds from sales of water will be shared equally after Vidler is reimbursed for the expenses incurred in developing water resources in Lincoln County. Lincoln/Vidler has filed applications for more than 100,000 acre-feet of water rights with the intention of supplying water for residential, commercial, and industrial use, as contemplated by the county’s approved master plan. We believe that this is the only known new source of water for Lincoln County. Although it is uncertain, Vidler currently anticipates that over the long-term, up to 40,000 acre-feet of water rights will ultimately be permitted from these applications, and put to use for planned projects in Lincoln County.
Tule Desert Groundwater Basin
Lincoln/Vidler jointly filed permit applications in 1998 for approximately 14,000 acre-feet of water rights for industrial use from the Tule Desert Groundwater Basin in Lincoln County, Nevada. In November 2002, the Nevada State Engineer awarded Lincoln/Vidler a permit for 2,100 acre-feet of water rights, which Lincoln/Vidler subsequently sold in 2005, and ruled that an additional 7,240 acre-feet could be granted pending additional studies by Lincoln/Vidler (the “2002 Ruling”). Subsequent to the 2002 Ruling and consistent with the Nevada State Engineer’s conditions, we completed these additional engineering and scientific studies.
On April 15, 2010, Lincoln/Vidler and the Nevada State Engineer announced a Settlement Agreement with respect to litigation between the parties regarding the amount of water to be permitted in the Tule Desert Groundwater Basin. The Settlement Agreement resulted in the granting to Lincoln/Vidler of the original application of 7,240 acre-feet of water rights with an initial 2,900 acre-feet of water rights available for sale or lease by Lincoln/Vidler. The balance of the water rights (4,340 acre-feet) is the subject of staged pumping and development over the next several years to further refine the modeling of the basin and potential impacts, if any, from deep aquifer pumping in the remote, unpopulated desert valley in Lincoln County, Nevada.
The Tule Desert Groundwater Basin water resources were developed by Lincoln/Vidler to support the Lincoln County Recreation, Conservation and Development Act of 2004 (the “Land Act”). The water permitted under the Settlement Agreement is anticipated to provide sufficient water resources to a portion of the Land Act properties.
Kane Springs
In 2005, Lincoln/Vidler agreed to sell water to a developer of Coyote Springs, a new planned residential and commercial development 60 miles north of Las Vegas, as and when supplies were permitted from Lincoln/Vidler’s existing applications in Kane Springs, Nevada. Lincoln/Vidler currently has priority applications for approximately 17,375 acre-feet of water in Kane Springs for which the Nevada State Engineer has requested additional data before making a determination on the applications from this groundwater basin. The actual permits received may be for a lesser quantity, which cannot be accurately predicted.
Currently, we have an option agreement with a developer to sell our remaining 500 acre-feet of water rights we own in this area at a price of $6,358 per acre-foot that is escalated at 7.5% per year from September 2017. The agreement expires in September 2019 with a cost to exercise of approximately $3.5 million. To date, the developer has made all required annual option payments.
