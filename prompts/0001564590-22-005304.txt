Proprietary Products
 We have developed and now commercialize products designed to help address the unmet needs of people living with opioid dependence, alcohol dependence, schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. See the “Patents and Proprietary Rights” section in “Item 1—Business” in this Annual Report for information with respect to the IP protection for our proprietary products.
ARISTADA 
 ARISTADA (aripiprazole lauroxil) is an extended-release intramuscular injectable suspension approved in the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia. ARISTADA utilizes our proprietary LinkeRx technology. ARISTADA is a prodrug; once in the body, ARISTADA is likely converted by enzyme-mediated hydrolysis to N-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole, which is then hydrolyzed to aripiprazole. ARISTADA is available in four dose strengths with once-monthly dosing options (441 mg, 662 mg and 882 mg), a six-week dosing option (882 mg) and a two-month dosing option (1064 mg). ARISTADA is packaged in a ready-to-use, pre-filled syringe product format. We developed ARISTADA and exclusively manufacture and commercialize it in the U.S.
ARISTADA INITIO
 ARISTADA INITIO (aripiprazole lauroxil) leverages our proprietary LinkeRx and NanoCrystal technologies and provides an extended-release formulation of aripiprazole lauroxil in a smaller particle size compared to ARISTADA, thereby enabling faster dissolution and more rapid achievement of relevant levels of aripiprazole in the body. ARISTADA INITIO, combined with a single 30 mg dose of oral aripiprazole, is indicated for the initiation of ARISTADA when used for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. The first ARISTADA dose may be administered on the same day as the ARISTADA INITIO regimen or up to 10 days thereafter. We developed ARISTADA INITIO and exclusively manufacture and commercialize it in the U.S.
 What is schizophrenia?
 Schizophrenia is a serious brain disorder marked by positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions, disorganized speech and thoughts, and agitated or repeated movements) and negative symptoms (depression, blunted emotions and social withdrawal). Schizophrenia affects approximately 1.1% of the U.S. population.
 LYBALVI 
 LYBALVI (olanzapine and samidorphan) is a once-daily, oral atypical antipsychotic drug approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia and for the treatment of adults with bipolar I disorder, as a maintenance monotherapy or for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes, as monotherapy or an adjunct to lithium or valproate. LYBALVI is composed of olanzapine, an established antipsychotic agent, co-formulated with samidorphan, a new chemical entity, in a single bilayer tablet. LYBALVI was launched commercially in October 2021 and is available in fixed dosage strengths composed of 10 mg of samidorphan and 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg or 20 mg of olanzapine. We developed LYBALVI and exclusively manufacture and commercialize it in the U.S.
 What is bipolar I disorder?
 Bipolar I disorder is a brain disorder that is marked by extreme changes in a person’s mood, energy and ability to function. Individuals with this brain disorder may experience debilitating changes in mood from extreme highs (mania) to extreme lows (depression). Bipolar I disorder is characterized by the occurrence of at least one manic episode, with or without the occurrence of a major depressive episode, and affects approximately 1% of the American adult population in any given year.
 VIVITROL 
 VIVITROL (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension) is a once-monthly, non-narcotic, injectable medication approved in the U.S., Russia and certain countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States for the treatment of alcohol dependence and for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification. VIVITROL uses our polymer-based microsphere injectable extended-release technology to deliver and maintain therapeutic medication levels in the body through one intramuscular injection every four weeks. We developed and exclusively manufacture VIVITROL and we commercialize it in the U.S.
 For a discussion of legal proceedings related to VIVITROL, see Note 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report, and for information about risks relating to such legal proceedings, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in this Annual Report and specifically the sections entitled “Patent and other IP protection for our products is key to our business and our competitive position but is uncertain,” “Uncertainty over IP in the biopharmaceutical industry has been the source of litigation, which is inherently costly and unpredictable, could significantly delay or prevent approval or negatively impact commercialization of our products, and could adversely affect our business” and “Litigation or arbitration filed against Alkermes, including securities litigation, or actions (such as citizens petitions) filed against regulatory agencies in respect of our 
 9

products, may result in financial losses, harm our reputation, divert management resources, negatively impact the approval of our products, or otherwise negatively impact our business.”
 What are opioid dependence and alcohol dependence?
 Opioid dependence is a serious and chronic brain disease characterized by compulsive, prolonged self-administration of opioid substances that are not used for a medical purpose. According to the 2020 U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an estimated 2.6 million people aged 18 or older in the U.S. had an opioid use disorder in the past year. Alcohol dependence is a serious and chronic brain disease characterized by cravings for alcohol, loss of control over drinking, withdrawal symptoms and an increased tolerance for alcohol. According to the 2020 U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an estimated 27.8 million people aged 18 or older in the U.S. had an alcohol use disorder in the past year. Adherence to medication is particularly challenging with these patient populations.
 In 2013, with the publication of the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (“DSM”) 5, the DSM IV diagnoses of substance use disorders as either dependence or abuse (i.e., opioid dependence or alcohol dependence), which reflects the approved indications of VIVITROL, were subsumed under a new diagnostic category of “substance use disorders” (i.e., opioid use disorder or alcohol use disorder) with three categories of disorder severity—mild, moderate or severe.

 Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is an unpredictable, often disabling disease of the central nervous system (“CNS”), which interrupts the flow of information within the brain, and between the brain and body. MS symptoms can vary over time and from person to person. Symptoms may include extreme fatigue, impaired vision, problems with balance and walking, numbness or pain and other sensory changes, bladder and bowel symptoms, tremors, problems with memory and concentration and mood changes, among others. Approximately 2.5 million people worldwide have MS, and most are diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 50.
 Key Development Program
 Our R&D is focused on the development of innovative medicines in the fields of neuroscience and oncology that are designed to address unmet patient needs. As part of our ongoing R&D efforts, we have devoted, and will continue to devote, significant resources to conducting preclinical work and clinical studies to advance the development of new pharmaceutical products. The discussion below highlights our current key development program. Drug development involves a high degree of risk and investment, and the status, timing and scope of our development programs are subject to change. Important factors that could adversely affect our drug development efforts are discussed in “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in this Annual Report. See the “Patents and Proprietary Rights” section in “Item 1—Business” in this Annual Report for information with respect to the IP protection for our key development program. 
 nemvaleukin alfa 
 
Nemvaleukin alfa (“nemvaleukin”) is an investigational, novel, engineered fusion protein comprised of modified interleukin-2 (“IL-2”) and the high affinity IL-2 alpha receptor chain, designed to preferentially expand tumor-killing immune cells while avoiding 
 11

the activation of immunosuppressive cells by selectively binding to the intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptor complex. The selectivity of nemvaleukin is designed to leverage the proven anti-tumor effects of existing IL-2 therapy while mitigating certain limitations.
 
ARTISTRY is our clinical development program evaluating nemvaleukin as a potential immunotherapy for cancer. The ARTISTRY program is comprised of multiple clinical trials evaluating intravenous (“IV”) and subcutaneous (“SC”) dosing of nemvaleukin, both as a monotherapy and in combination with the anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in patients with advanced solid tumors. ARTISTRY-1 (evaluating IV nemvaleukin) and ARTISTRY-2 (evaluating SC nemvaleukin) are ongoing phase 1/2 studies evaluating the safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of nemvaleukin in patients with refractory advanced solid tumors, in both monotherapy and combination settings. ARTISTRY-3 is an ongoing phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of less frequent  dosing of IV nemvaleukin and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of IV nemvaleukin in the tumor microenvironment as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in a variety of advanced solid tumors. ARTISTRY-6 is an ongoing phase 2 study evaluating the anti-tumor activity, safety and tolerability of IV nemvaleukin monotherapy in patients with mucosal melanoma and SC nemvaleukin monotherapy in patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma. ARTISTRY-7 is an ongoing phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of IV nemvaleukin as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab compared to investigator’s choice chemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
 
In March 2021 and August 2021, we announced that the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track designation, respectively, to nemvaleukin for the treatment of mucosal melanoma. In October 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to nemvaleukin in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
 Collaborative Arrangements
 We have entered into several collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize products and, in connection with such arrangements, to access technological, financial, marketing, manufacturing and other resources.
Janssen
 INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION, INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA and INVEGA HAFYERA/BYANNLI
 In November 2021, we received notice of partial termination in the U.S. of our license agreement with Janssen related to INVEGA SUSTENNA, INVEGA TRINZA, and INVEGA HAFYERA. The basis for this termination is Janssen’s assertion that it does not utilize our NanoCrystal technology licensed under the license agreement. We strongly disagree with Janssen’s position and are prepared to pursue all options at our disposal to enforce our contractual rights and address any unauthorized use of our intellectual property. For information about risks relating to this notice of partial termination and our collaborative arrangements more broadly, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in this Annual Report and specifically those sections entitled “We rely heavily on our licensees in the commercialization and continued development of products from which we receive revenue and, if our licensees are not effective, or if disputes arise in respect of our contractual arrangements, our revenues could be materially adversely affected.”
 Under our license agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V., we granted Janssen a worldwide exclusive license under our NanoCrystal technology to develop, commercialize and manufacture injectable pharmaceutical products containing paliperidone palmitate, which include the long-acting INVEGA products.
 Under this license agreement, we received milestone payments from Janssen upon the achievement of certain development goals; there are no further milestones to be earned under this agreement. The agreement also provides for tiered royalty payments between 3.5% and 9% of net sales of products subject to the agreement in each country where the license is in effect, with the exact royalty percentage determined based on aggregate worldwide net sales. The tiered royalty payments consist of a patent royalty and a know‑how royalty, both of which are determined on a country‑by‑country basis. The patent royalty, which equals 1.5% of net sales, is payable in each country until the expiration of the last of the royalty-bearing patents with valid claims applicable to the product in such country. The know‑how royalty is a tiered royalty of 3.5% on calendar year net sales up to $250 million, 5.5% on calendar year net sales of between $250 million and $500 million and 7.5% on calendar year net sales exceeding $500 million. The know‑how royalty rate resets to 3.5% at the beginning of each calendar year and is payable until 15 years from the first commercial sale of a product in each individual country. These royalty payments may be reduced in any country based on patent litigation or on competing products achieving certain minimum sales thresholds. The license agreement, unless earlier terminated, terminates upon the expiration of the last of the patents subject to the agreement. After expiration, Janssen retains a non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to develop, manufacture and commercialize the products subject to certain surviving obligations.
 Janssen may terminate the license agreement in whole or in part upon three months’ notice to us. We and Janssen have the right to terminate the agreement upon a material breach of the other party, which is not cured within a certain time period, or upon the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency.
 12

RISPERDAL CONSTA
 Under a product development agreement, we collaborated with Janssen on the development of RISPERDAL CONSTA. Under the development agreement, Janssen provided funding to us for the development of RISPERDAL CONSTA, and Janssen is responsible for securing all necessary regulatory approvals for the product.
 Under two license agreements, we granted Janssen and an affiliate of Janssen exclusive worldwide licenses to use and sell RISPERDAL CONSTA. Under our license agreements with Janssen, we receive royalty payments equal to 2.5% of Janssen’s end-market net sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA in each country where the license is in effect based on the quarter when the product is sold by Janssen. This royalty may be reduced in any country based on lack of patent coverage and significant competition from generic versions of the product. Janssen can terminate the license agreements upon 30 days’ prior written notice to us. Either party may terminate the license agreements by written notice following a breach which continues for 90 days after the delivery of written notice thereof or upon the other party’s insolvency. The licenses granted to Janssen expire on a country‑by‑country basis upon the later of (i) the expiration of the last patent claiming the product in such country or (ii) 15 years after the date of the first commercial sale of the product in such country, provided that in no event will the license granted to Janssen expire later than the twentieth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in each such country, with the exception of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain and the United Kingdom, in each case, where the fifteen‑year minimum shall pertain regardless. After expiration, Janssen retains a non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to manufacture, use and sell RISPERDAL CONSTA.
 We exclusively manufacture RISPERDAL CONSTA for commercial sale. Under our manufacturing and supply agreement with Janssen, we receive manufacturing revenue based on a percentage of Janssen’s net unit sales price for RISPERDAL CONSTA for the applicable calendar year. This percentage is determined based on Janssen’s unit demand for such calendar year and varies based on the volume of units shipped, with a minimum manufacturing fee of 7.5%. Either party may terminate the manufacturing and supply agreement upon a material breach by the other party, which is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of a written notice specifying the material breach or upon written notice in the event of the other party’s insolvency or bankruptcy. Janssen may terminate the agreement upon six months’ written notice to us. In the event that Janssen terminates the manufacturing and supply agreement without terminating the license agreements, the royalty rate payable to us on Janssen’s net sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA would increase from 2.5% to 5.0%.
 Revenues from our collaborative arrangements with Janssen accounted for approximately 30%, 33% and 28% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
 
Biogen
 Under a license and collaboration agreement with Biogen, which we entered into in November 2017 and amended in October 2018, January 2019 and October 2019, we granted Biogen a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable license to develop, manufacture and commercialize VUMERITY and other products covered by patents licensed to Biogen under that agreement. 
 Under this license and collaboration agreement, we received an upfront cash payment and milestone payments upon the achievement of certain milestones, including FDA approval of the NDA for VUMERITY in October 2019, and amendment of the license and collaboration agreement in October 2019. We are also eligible to receive additional payments upon achievement of certain milestones, including milestones relating to the first two products, other than VUMERITY, covered by patents licensed to Biogen under the license and collaboration agreement.
 In addition, we receive a 15% royalty on worldwide net sales of VUMERITY, subject to, under certain circumstances, minimum annual payments for the first five years following FDA approval of VUMERITY. We are also entitled to receive royalties on net sales of products other than VUMERITY covered by patents licensed to Biogen under the license and collaboration agreement, at tiered royalty rates calculated as percentages of net sales ranging from high-single digits to sub-teen double digits. All royalties are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of (i) the last-to-expire patent right covering the applicable product in the applicable country and (ii) a specified period of time from the first commercial sale of the applicable product in the applicable country. Royalties for all products and the minimum annual payments for VUMERITY are subject to customary reductions, as set forth in the license and collaboration agreement.
 Except in limited circumstances, we were responsible for the development of VUMERITY until it was approved by the FDA. Following FDA approval of VUMERITY and except for the manufacturing responsibilities discussed below, Biogen is now responsible for all development and commercialization activities for VUMERITY and all other products covered by the patents that we licensed to Biogen. 
 Under the license and collaboration agreement, Biogen appointed us as the toll manufacturer of clinical and commercial supplies of VUMERITY, subject to Biogen’s right to manufacture or have manufactured commercial supplies as a back-up manufacturer and 
 13

subject to good faith agreement by the parties on the terms of such manufacturing arrangements. In October 2019, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with Biogen for the commercial supply of VUMERITY, an amendment to such commercial supply agreement and an amendment to the November 2017 license and collaboration agreement with Biogen. Biogen has elected to initiate a technology transfer and, following a transition period, assume responsibility for the manufacture (itself or through a designee) of clinical supplies of VUMERITY and up to 100% of commercial supplies of VUMERITY in exchange for an increase in the royalty rate to be paid by Biogen to us on net sales of that portion of product that is manufactured by Biogen or its designee. 
 Unless earlier terminated, the license and collaboration agreement will remain in effect until the expiry of all royalty obligations. Biogen has the right to terminate the license and collaboration agreement at will, on a product-by-product basis or in its entirety upon 180 days’ prior notice to us. Either party has the right to terminate the license and collaboration agreement following any governmental prohibition of the transactions effected by the agreement, or in connection with an insolvency event involving the other party. Upon termination of the license and collaboration agreement by either party, then, at our request, the VUMERITY program will revert to us.
 Revenues from Biogen related to this license and collaboration agreement accounted for approximately 7%, 2% and 17% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 Proprietary Technology Platforms
 We have used our proprietary technology platforms, which include technologies owned and exclusively licensed to us, to establish drug development, clinical development and regulatory expertise and in the development of our products.
Injectable Extended‑Release Microsphere Technology
 Our injectable extended‑release microsphere technology allows us to encapsulate small‑molecule pharmaceuticals, peptides and proteins in microspheres made of common medical polymers. The technology is designed to enable novel formulations of pharmaceuticals by providing controlled, extended release of drugs over time. Drug release from the microsphere is controlled by diffusion of the drug through the microsphere and by biodegradation of the polymer. These processes can be modulated through a number of formulation and fabrication variables, including drug substance and microsphere particle sizing and choice of polymers and excipients.
 LinkeRx Technology
 Our long‑acting LinkeRx technology platform is designed to enable the creation of extended‑release injectable versions of antipsychotic therapies and may also be useful in other disease areas in which extended duration of action may provide therapeutic benefits. The technology uses proprietary linker‑tail chemistry to create new molecular entities derived from known agents.
 NanoCrystal Technology
 Our NanoCrystal technology is applicable to poorly water‑soluble compounds and involves formulating and stabilizing drugs into particles that are nanometers in size. A drug in NanoCrystal form can be incorporated into a range of common dosage forms, including tablets, capsules, inhalation devices and sterile forms for injection, with the potential for enhanced oral bioavailability, increased therapeutic effectiveness, reduced/eliminated fed/fasted variability and sustained duration of intravenous/intramuscular release.
 Oral Controlled Release Technology
 Our oral controlled release (“OCR”) technologies are used to formulate, develop and manufacture oral dosage forms of pharmaceutical products with varied drug release profiles. 
 Manufacturing and Product Supply
 We own and occupy an R&D and manufacturing facility in Athlone, Ireland and a manufacturing facility in Wilmington, Ohio. We either purchase active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) from third parties or receive it from our third‑party licensees to formulate products using our technologies. The manufacture of our products for clinical trials and commercial use is subject to Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations and other regulations. Our manufacturing and development capabilities include formulation through process development, scale‑up and full‑scale commercial manufacturing and specialized capabilities for the development and manufacturing of controlled substances.
 Although some materials and related services for our products are currently only available from a single source or a limited number of qualified sources, we attempt to acquire an adequate inventory of such materials, establish alternative sources for such 
 14

materials and related services and/or negotiate long‑term supply arrangements. However, we cannot be certain that we will continue to be able to obtain long‑term supplies of our manufacturing materials or long-term provision of related services.
 Our supply chain is growing with an expanding external network of third‑party service providers involved in the manufacture of our products who are subject to inspection by the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the acquisition of API, raw materials, or components, or in the manufacture, fill‑finish, packaging, or storage of our marketed or development products, including as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to pass any regulatory agency inspection, could significantly impair our ability to sell our products or advance our development efforts, as the case may be. For information about risks relating to the manufacture of our marketed products and product candidates, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in this Annual Report and specifically those sections entitled “We rely on third parties to provide services in connection with the manufacture and distribution of the products we manufacture” and “We are subject to risks related to the manufacture of our products.”
 Marketed Products
 We manufacture ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO, LYBALVI, VIVITROL and microspheres for RISPERDAL CONSTA at our Wilmington, Ohio facility. We outsource our packaging operations for ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO, LYBALVI and VIVITROL to third‑party contractors. Janssen is responsible for packaging operations for RISPERDAL CONSTA. Our Wilmington, Ohio facility has been inspected by U.S., European (including the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency), Chinese, Japanese, Brazilian, Turkish, Russian and Saudi Arabian regulatory authorities for compliance with required cGMP standards for continued commercial manufacturing.

This facility has been inspected by U.S., Irish, Brazilian, Turkish, Saudi Arabian, Korean, Belarusian, Russian and Chinese regulatory authorities for compliance with required cGMP standards for continued commercial manufacturing. 
 For more information about our manufacturing facilities, see “Item 2—Properties” in this Annual Report.
 Clinical Products 
 We have established, and are operating, facilities with the capability to manufacture clinical supplies of injectable extended‑release products and solid dosage form products at our Wilmington, Ohio facility and solid dosage form products at our Athlone, Ireland facility. We have also contracted with third‑party manufacturers to formulate certain products for clinical use. We require that our contract manufacturers adhere to cGMP in the manufacture of products for clinical use.
Research & Development
 We devote significant resources to R&D programs. We focus our R&D efforts on developing novel therapeutics in areas of high unmet medical need. Our R&D efforts include, but are not limited to, areas such as pharmaceutical formulation, analytical chemistry, process development, engineering, scale‑up and drug optimization/delivery. Please see “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report for additional information relating to our R&D expenditures. 
Permits and Regulatory Approvals
 We hold various licenses in respect of our manufacturing activities conducted in Wilmington, Ohio and Athlone, Ireland. The primary licenses held in this regard are FDA Registrations of Drug Establishment and Drug Enforcement Administration of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DEA”). We also hold a Manufacturers Authorization (No. M1067), an Investigational Medicinal Products Manufacturers Authorization (No. IMP074) and Certificates of Good Manufacturing Practice Compliance of a Manufacturer (Ref. 2014/7828/IMP074 and 2014/7828/M1067) from the Health Products Regulatory Authority in Ireland (“HPRA”) in respect of our Athlone, Ireland facility, and a number of Controlled Substance Licenses granted by HPRA. Due to certain U.S. state law requirements, we also hold state licenses to cover distribution activities conducted in certain states and not in respect of any manufacturing activities conducted in those states.
 We do not generally act as the marketing authorization holder for products incorporating our drug delivery technologies that have been developed on behalf of a licensee of such technologies. In such cases, our licensee usually holds the relevant marketing authorization from the FDA or other relevant regulatory authority, and we would support this authorization by furnishing a copy of the product’s Drug Master File, or chemistry, manufacturing and controls data, to the relevant regulator. We generally update this information annually with the relevant regulator. In other cases where we have developed proprietary products, such as VIVITROL, ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO and LYBALVI, we hold the marketing authorization and related regulatory documentation ourselves.

Marketing, Sales and Distribution
 We are responsible for the marketing of VIVITROL, ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO, and LYBALVI in the U.S. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on physicians in private practice and in public treatment systems. We believe that we use customary pharmaceutical company practices to market our products, including through advertisements, professional symposia, selling initiatives and other methods, and to educate individual physicians, nurses, social workers, counselors and other stakeholders involved in the treatment of opioid dependence, alcohol dependence, schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. We provide, and contract with third‑party vendors to provide, customer services and other related programs for our products, such as product‑specific websites, insurance research services and order, delivery and fulfillment services.
 Our sales force for VIVITROL in the U.S. consists of approximately 115 individuals. VIVITROL is primarily sold to pharmaceutical wholesalers, pharmacies, specialty distributors and treatment providers. Product sales of VIVITROL during the year ended December 31, 2021 to Cardinal Health, McKesson Corporation and AmerisourceBergen Corporation (“AmerisourceBergen”) represented approximately 23%, 22% and 15%, respectively, of total VIVITROL gross sales.
 Our sales force for ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO and LYBALVI in the U.S. consists of approximately 310 individuals. ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO and LYBALVI are primarily sold to pharmaceutical wholesalers. Product sales of ARISTADA and ARISTADA INITIO during the year ended December 31, 2021 to Cardinal Health, McKesson Corporation and AmerisourceBergen represented approximately 47%, 23% and 23%, respectively, of total ARISTADA and ARISTADA INITIO gross sales. Product sales of LYBALVI during the year ended December 31, 2021 to Cardinal Health, McKesson Corporation and AmerisourceBergen represented approximately 36%, 30% and 27%, respectively, of total LYBALVI gross sales.
 ICS, a division of AmerisourceBergen, provides warehousing, shipping and administrative services for VIVITROL, ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO and LYBALVI.
 Under our license agreements with Janssen, Biogen and other licensees and sublicensees, the licensees and sublicensees are typically responsible for the commercialization of any products developed under their respective agreements if and when regulatory approval is obtained.
 Competition
 We face intense competition in the development, manufacture, marketing and commercialization of our products from many and varied sources, such as research institutions and biopharmaceutical companies, including other companies with similar technologies. Some of these competitors are also our licensees, who control the commercialization of products from which we receive manufacturing and royalty revenues. These competitors are working to develop and market other products, systems, and other methods of preventing or reducing disease, and new small‑molecule and other classes of drugs.
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intensive research, development and commercialization efforts and rapid and significant technological change. In many cases, there are already products on the market that may be in direct competition with our commercial products or products in development. In addition, there are many companies developing products for use in similar indications or with similar technologies to ours with whom we and our licensees compete, many of whom are larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. Other smaller or earlier stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through focused development programs and collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Some of the products being developed by our competitors are being designed to work differently than our products and may turn out to be safer or more effective than our products, which may render our products or technology platforms obsolete or noncompetitive. With respect to our products, we believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things, the existence of competing or alternative products in the marketplace, including generic competition, and the relative price of those products; the efficacy, safety and reliability of our products compared to competing or alternative products; product acceptance by, and preferences of, physicians, other healthcare providers and patients; our ability to comply with applicable laws, regulations and regulatory requirements with respect to the commercialization of our products, including any changes or increases to regulatory restrictions; protection of our proprietary rights relating to our products; our ability to obtain reimbursement for our products; our ability to complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for our products, and the timing and scope of any such regulatory approvals; our ability to successfully manufacture and provide a reliable supply of commercial quantities of a product to the market; and our ability to recruit, retain and develop skilled employees.
 With respect to our proprietary injectable product platform, we are aware that there are other companies developing extended-release delivery systems for pharmaceutical products, including but not limited to, Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd.’s development of a risperidone extended-release injectable suspension for subcutaneous use and a once every two weeks injectable microsphere formulation, each for the treatment of schizophrenia, and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.’s Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) seeking approval to commercialize a generic version of VIVITROL (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension). 
 16

In the treatment of schizophrenia, ARISTADA, the long-acting INVEGA products and RISPERDAL CONSTA compete with each other and a number of other injectable products, including ZYPREXA RELPREVV ((olanzapine) For Extended Release Injectable Suspension), which is marketed and sold by Lilly; ABILIFY MAINTENA (aripiprazole for extended release injectable suspension), a once-monthly injectable formulation of ABILIFY (aripiprazole) developed by Otsuka Pharm. Co.; PERSERIS (risperidone for extended release injectable suspension), a once-monthly formulation of risperidone marketed by Indivior plc; and generic versions of branded injectable products. 
 In the treatment of schizophrenia, LYBALVI competes with other oral antipsychotic products, including CAPLYTA (lumateperone) developed and marketed by Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc.; LATUDA, which is marketed and sold by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.; REXULTI, which is co-marketed by Otsuka Pharm Co. and H. Lundbeck A/S plc; VRAYLAR, which is marketed and sold by Abbvie Inc.; other oral compounds currently on the market; and generic versions of branded oral products. 
 In the treatment of bipolar disorder, LYBALVI and RISPERDAL CONSTA compete with antipsychotics such as oral aripiprazole; REXULTI; LATUDA; VRAYLAR; ABILIFY MAINTENA; CAPLYTA; risperidone; quetiapine; olanzapine; ziprasidone and clozapine.
 In the treatment of alcohol dependence, VIVITROL competes with generic acamprosate calcium (also known as CAMPRAL) and generic disulfiram (also known as ANTABUSE) as well as currently marketed drugs, including generic drugs, also formulated from naltrexone. Other pharmaceutical companies are developing products that have shown some promise in treating alcohol dependence that, if approved by the FDA, would compete with VIVITROL.
 In the treatment of opioid dependence, VIVITROL competes with SUBOXONE (buprenorphine HCl/naloxone HCl dehydrate sublingual tablets), SUBOXONE (buprenorphine/naloxone) Sublingual Film, SUBUTEX (buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets) and SUBLOCADE (once-monthly buprenorphine extended-release injection), each of which is marketed and sold by Indivior plc; BUNAVAIL buccal film (buprenorphine and naloxone) marketed by BioDelivery Sciences; and ZUBSOLV (buprenorphine and naloxone) marketed by Orexo US, Inc. VIVITROL also competes with methadone, oral naltrexone and generic versions of SUBUTEX and SUBOXONE sublingual tablets. Other pharmaceutical companies are developing products that have shown promise in treating opioid dependence that, if approved by the FDA, would compete with VIVITROL.
 In the treatment of MS, VUMERITY competes with AVONEX, TYSABRI, TECFIDERA, and PLEGRIDY from Biogen; OCREVUS from Genentech; BETASERON from Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals; COPAXONE from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.; REBIF and MAVENCLAD from EMD Serono, Inc.; GILENYA, EXTAVIA and MAYZENT from Novartis AG; AUBAGIO and LEMTRADA from Sanofi-Aventis; ZEPOSIA from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; and PONVORY from Janssen. 
 With respect to our NanoCrystal technology, we are aware that other technology approaches similarly address poorly water‑soluble drugs. These approaches include nanoparticles, cyclodextrins, lipid‑based self‑emulsifying drug delivery systems, dendrimers and micelles, among others, any of which could limit the potential success and growth prospects of products incorporating our NanoCrystal technology. In addition, there are many competing technologies to our OCR technology, some of which are owned by large pharmaceutical companies with drug delivery divisions and other, smaller drug‑delivery‑specific companies.

Patents and Proprietary Rights
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, including those marketed and sold by our licensees, to maintain trade secret protection and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We have a proprietary portfolio of patent rights and exclusive licenses to patents and patent applications, which includes numerous patents in the U.S. and in other countries directed to compositions of matter, methods of treatment and formulations, as well as processes of preparation. In the future, we plan to file additional patent applications in the U.S. and in other countries directed to new or improved products and processes, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend our patent positions. In addition, our licensees may own additional patents that cover those products owned by such licensees that incorporate our proprietary technologies and for which we receive royalties.
ARISTADA and ARISTADA INITIO
 We have several U.S. patents and patent applications, and a number of corresponding non-U.S. counterparts, that cover ARISTADA and/or ARISTADA INITIO. Our principal U.S. patents for ARISTADA and/or ARISTADA INITIO and their expiration dates are as follows:

U.S. Patent Nos. 9,359,415 and 10,407,481, each expiring in 2033, cover compositions of nemvaleukin. U.S. Patent No. 11,246,906, expiring in 2040, covers subcutaneous dosing regimens of nemvaleukin.  U.S. Patent No. 11,248,050, expiring in 2040, covers certain combination therapies utilizing nemvaleukin.
 Protection of Proprietary Rights and Competitive Position
 We have exclusive rights through licensing agreements with third parties to issued U.S. patents, pending patent applications and corresponding patents or patent applications in countries outside the U.S, subject in certain instances to the rights of the U.S. government to use the technology covered by such patents and patent applications. Under certain licensing agreements, we are responsible for patent expenses, and we pay annual license fees and/or minimum annual royalties. In addition, under these licensing agreements, we are typically obligated to pay royalties on future sales of products, if any, covered by the licensed patents.
 There may be patents issued to third parties that relate to our products or technologies. The manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale or import of some of our products might be found to infringe on the claims of these patents. A third party might file an infringement 
 19

action against us. The cost of defending such an action is likely to be high, and we might not receive a favorable ruling. There may also be patent applications filed by third parties that relate to some of our products if issued in their present form. The patent laws of the U.S. and other countries are distinct, and decisions as to patenting, validity of patents and infringement of patents may be resolved differently in different countries. 
 If patents exist or are issued that cover our products or technologies, we or our licensees may not be able to manufacture, use, offer for sale, sell or import some of our products without first getting a license from the patent holder. The patent holder may not grant us a license on reasonable terms, or it may refuse to grant us a license at all. This could delay or prevent us from developing, manufacturing, selling or importing those of our products that would require the license.
 We try to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and in other countries related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. Because the patent position of biopharmaceutical companies involves complex legal and factual questions, enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. The ultimate degree of patent protection that will be afforded to products and processes, including ours, in the U.S. and in other important markets, remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices, courts and lawmakers in these countries. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Thus, any patents that we own or license from others may not provide any protection against competitors. Our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties, may not result in patents being issued. If issued, they may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology that we have developed outside the scope of our patents. The laws of certain countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.
 We also rely on trade secrets, know‑how and inventions, which are not protected by patents, to maintain our competitive position. We try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to it, such as our corporate partners, collaborators, licensees, employees and consultants. However, any of these parties may breach such agreements and may disclose our confidential information or our competitors might learn of the information in some other way. If any trade secret, know‑how or other invention not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor, such event could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. For more information, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.
 Our trademarks, including VIVITROL, ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO and LYBALVI, are important to us and are generally covered by trademark applications or registrations with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the patent or trademark offices of other countries. Our licensed products and products using our proprietary technologies also use trademarks that are owned by our licensees, such as the trademarks for INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION, INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA, INVEGA HAFYERA/BYANNLI and RISPERDAL CONSTA, which are registered trademarks of Johnson & Johnson Corporation, VUMERITY, which is a registered trademark of Biogen (and used by Alkermes under license) and AMPYRA and FAMPYRA, which are registered trademarks of Acorda. Trademark protection varies in accordance with local law and continues in some countries as long as the trademark is used and in other countries as long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms.
 Regulatory
 Regulation of Pharmaceutical Products
 United States
 Our current and contemplated activities, and the products and processes that result from such activities, are subject to substantial government regulation. Before new pharmaceutical products may be sold in the U.S., preclinical studies and clinical trials of the products must be conducted and the results submitted to the FDA for approval. Clinical trial programs must determine an appropriate dose and regimen, establish substantial evidence of effectiveness and define the conditions for safe use. This is a high‑risk process that requires stepwise clinical studies in which the product must successfully meet pre‑specified endpoints.
 Preclinical Testing:  Before beginning testing of any compounds with potential therapeutic value in human subjects in the U.S., stringent government requirements for preclinical data must be satisfied. Preclinical testing includes both in vitro, or in an artificial environment outside of a living organism, and in vivo, or within a living organism, laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of a drug and its formulation.
 Investigational New Drug Exemption:  Preclinical testing results obtained from in vivo studies in several animal species, as well as from in vitro studies, are submitted to the FDA, as part of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”), and are reviewed by the FDA prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. The preclinical data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical studies in human volunteers.
 20

Clinical Trials:  Clinical trials involve the administration of a drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator pursuant to an FDA‑reviewed protocol. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another and, depending upon the nature of the clinical program, a specific phase or phases may be skipped altogether. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the applicable IND.
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials—test for safety, dose tolerability, absorption, bio‑distribution, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology and, if possible, to gain early evidence regarding efficacy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials—involve a relatively small sample of the actual intended patient population and seek to assess the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications, to determine dose‑response and the optimal dose range and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials—consist of expanded, large‑scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain definitive statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the proposed product and dosing regimen.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the U.S., the results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a product are then submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or a Biologics License Application (“BLA”). The NDA or BLA also include information pertaining to the preparation of the product, analytical methods, details of the manufacture of finished products and proposed product packaging and labeling. The submission of an application is not a guarantee that the FDA will find the application complete and accept it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file the application if it is not considered sufficiently complete to permit a review and will inform the applicant of the reason for the refusal. The applicant may then resubmit the application and include supplemental information.
 Once an NDA or BLA is accepted for filing, the FDA has 10 months, under its standard review process, within which to review the application (for some applications, the review process is longer than 10 months). For drugs that, if approved, would represent a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications, the FDA may assign “priority review” designation and review the application within six months. The FDA has additional review pathways to expedite development and review of new drugs that are intended to treat serious or life‑threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs, including: “Fast Track,” “Breakthrough Therapy,” and “Accelerated Approval.” However, none of these expedited pathways ensure that a product will receive FDA approval in a timely manner or at all.
 As part of its review, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for independent advice on questions related to the development of the drug, recommendation as to whether the application should be approved or other guidance that the FDA may seek. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee; however, historically, it has often followed such recommendations. The FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks. If required, a REMS may include various elements, such as publication of a medication guide, a patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to support the safe use of the drug.
 In reviewing an NDA or BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, or issue a complete response letter to communicate to the applicant the reasons the application cannot be approved in its then-current form and provide input on the additional information that the FDA requires and/or changes that must be made before an application can be approved. Even if such additional information is submitted to the FDA or such changes made, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA still does not satisfy the FDA’s criteria for approval. The receipt of regulatory approval often takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, efficacy and potential safety signals observed in preclinical tests or clinical trials, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. It is impossible to predict with any certainty whether and when the FDA will grant marketing approval for a given product. Even if a product is approved, the approval may be subject to limitations based on the FDA’s interpretation of the data. For example, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, restricted distribution and use, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre‑approval of promotional materials or restrictions on direct‑to‑consumer advertising, any of which could negatively impact the commercial success of a drug. The FDA may also require a sponsor to conduct additional post‑marketing studies as a condition of approval to provide data on safety and effectiveness. In addition, prior to commercialization, products that may be deemed controlled substances are subject to review and scheduling by the DEA.
 The FDA tracks information on side effects and adverse events reported during clinical studies and after marketing approval. Non‑compliance with safety reporting requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties. Side effects or adverse events that are identified during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing approval. Based on new safety information that emerges after approval, the FDA can mandate product labeling changes, impose a REMS or the addition of elements to an existing REMS, require new post‑marketing studies (including additional clinical trials), or suspend or withdraw approval of the product. 
 If we seek to make certain types of changes to an approved product, such as adding a new indication, making certain manufacturing changes, or changing manufacturers or suppliers of certain ingredients or components, the FDA will need to review and approve such changes in advance. In the case of adding a new indication, we would be required to demonstrate with additional clinical data that the product is safe and effective for the new intended use. Such regulatory reviews can result in denial or modification of the 
 21

planned changes, or requirements to conduct additional tests or evaluations that can substantially delay or increase the cost of the planned changes.
 In addition, the FDA regulates all advertising and promotional activities for products under its jurisdiction. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are consistent with FDA regulation and guidance. However, physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling. Such off‑label uses are common across certain medical specialties and often reflect a physician’s belief that the off‑label use is the best treatment for a particular patient. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but the FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off‑label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA and the U.S. Department of Justice, corrective advertising and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA and the U.S. Department of Justice.
 Controlled Substances Act: The DEA regulates pharmaceutical products that are controlled substances. Controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of the five schedules promulgated and administered by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”). The CSA governs, among other things, the inventory, distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security and disposal of controlled substances. For example, pharmaceutical products that act on the CNS are often evaluated for abuse potential; if a product is then classified as a controlled substance, it must undergo scheduling by the DEA, which is a separate process that may delay the commercial launch of such product even after FDA approval of the NDA for such product. Further, companies with a scheduled pharmaceutical product are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the DEA and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess ongoing compliance with the DEA’s regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions, including the revocation, or a denial of renewal, of any DEA registration and injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.
Outside the United States
 Certain of our products are commercialized by our licensees in numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S. Most of these jurisdictions have product approval and post‑approval regulatory processes that are similar in principle to those in the U.S. In Europe, there are several tracks for marketing approval, depending on the type of product for which approval is sought. Under the centralized procedure, a company submits a single application to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”). The marketing application is similar to the NDA in the U.S. and is evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), the expert scientific committee of the EMA. If the CHMP determines that the marketing application fulfills the requirements for quality, safety, and efficacy, it will submit a favorable opinion to the European Commission (“EC”). The CHMP opinion is not binding, but is typically adopted by the EC. A marketing application approved by the EC is valid in all member states.
 In addition to the centralized procedure, Europe also has: (i) a nationalized procedure, which requires a separate application to, and approval determination by, each country; (ii) a decentralized procedure, whereby applicants submit identical applications to several countries and receive simultaneous approval; and (iii) a mutual recognition procedure, where applicants submit an application to one country for review and other countries may accept or reject the initial decision. Regardless of the approval process employed, various parties share responsibilities for the monitoring, detection and evaluation of adverse events post‑approval, including national authorities, the EMA, the EC, other relevant regulatory authorities and the marketing authorization holder.
 Good Manufacturing Processes
 The FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the EU member states and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical and biologic products prior to approving a product. In 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has in some instances impacted the FDA’s and other regulatory agencies’ ability to conduct on-site inspections and has resulted in such agencies either delaying planned inspections or collecting the requisite information through review of written records in lieu of an on-site inspection, which in some instances has negatively impacted timelines for potential product approvals. Once approval from a regulatory agency is obtained, if a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. Companies also must adhere to cGMP and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies both in the manufacture of clinical product and following product approval. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies also conduct regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities and processes following the initial approval of a product and may also request that certain information or records be provided in writing for review in lieu of an on-site visit. If, as a result of these inspections or records reviews, it is determined that our equipment, facilities or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, regulatory agencies may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations.
 22

Good Clinical Practices
 The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies promulgate regulations and standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), for designing, conducting, monitoring, auditing and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, trial sites, contract research organizations (“CROs”) and institutional review boards. If our studies fail to comply with applicable GCP, patient safety and well-being could be impacted, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable, and relevant regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Noncompliance can also result in civil or criminal sanctions. We rely on third parties, including CROs, to carry out many of our clinical trial‑related activities. Failure of such third parties to comply with GCP can likewise result in rejection of our clinical trial data or other sanctions.
 Hatch‑Waxman Act
 Under the U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch‑Waxman Act”), Congress created an abbreviated FDA review process for generic versions of pioneer, or brand‑name, drug products. The law also provides incentives by awarding, in certain circumstances, non‑patent related marketing exclusivities to pioneer drug manufacturers. Newly approved drug products and changes to the conditions of use of approved products may benefit from periods of non‑patent‑related marketing exclusivity in addition to any patent protection the drug product may have. The Hatch‑Waxman Act provides five years of new chemical entity (“NCE”) marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a product that contains an active ingredient, known as the active drug moiety, not found in any other approved product. The FDA is prohibited from accepting any ANDA for a generic drug or 505(b)(2) application referencing the NCE for five years from the date of approval of the NCE, or four years in the case of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a patent challenge, and in both cases may not approve such generic drug or 505(b)(2) application until expiration of NCE marketing exclusivity. A 505(b)(2) application is an NDA in which the applicant relies, in part, on data and the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Hatch-Waxman Act exclusivities will not prevent the submission or approval of a full NDA (e.g., under 505(b)(1)), as opposed to an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application, for any drug, including, for example, a drug with the same active ingredient, dosage form, route of administration, strength and conditions of use.
 The Hatch‑Waxman Act also provides three years of exclusivity for applications containing the results of new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, essential to the FDA’s approval of new uses of approved products, such as new indications, dosage forms, strengths, or conditions of use. However, this exclusivity only protects against the approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications for the protected use and will not prohibit the FDA from accepting or approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications for other products containing the same active ingredient.
 The Hatch‑Waxman Act requires NDA applicants and NDA holders to provide certain information about patents related to the drug for listing in the FDA’s Approved Drugs Product List, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. ANDA and 505(b)(2) applicants must then certify regarding each of the patents listed with the FDA for the reference product. A certification that a listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the marketing of the applicant’s product is called a “Paragraph IV certification.” If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant provides such a notification of patent invalidity or noninfringement, then the FDA may accept the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application four years after approval of the NDA for an NCE. If a Paragraph IV certification is filed and the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been accepted as a reviewable filing by the FDA, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant must then, within 20 days, provide notice to the NDA holder and patent owner stating that the application has been submitted and providing the factual and legal basis for the applicant’s opinion that the patent is invalid or not infringed. The NDA holder or patent owner may file suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement. If this is done within 45 days of receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification, a one‑time, 30‑month stay of the FDA’s ability to approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is triggered. The 30‑month stay begins at the end of the NDA holder’s data exclusivity period, or, if data exclusivity has expired, on the date that the patent holder is notified. The FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30‑month stay if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed, or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation.
 Sales and Marketing
 We are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti‑kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Due to the broad scope of the U.S. statutory provisions, the general absence of guidance in the form of regulations, and few court decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti‑kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to third‑party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Activities relating to the sale and marketing of our 
 23

products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). In addition, federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the U.S. government under the False Claims Act. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in this Annual Report and specifically those sections entitled “If there are changes in, or we fail to comply with, the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the healthcare industry, we could face costs, penalties and business losses,” “Revenues generated by sales of our products depend on the availability from third-party payers of reimbursement for our products and the extent of cost-sharing arrangements for patients (e.g., patient co-payment, co-insurance, deductible obligations) and cost-control measures imposed, and any reductions in payment rate or reimbursement or increases in our or in patients’ financial obligation to payers could result in decreased sales of our products and/or decreased revenues” and “The clinical study or commercial use of our products may cause unintended side effects or adverse reactions, or incidents of misuse may occur, which could adversely affect our products, business and share price.”
 Laws and regulations have been enacted by the U.S. federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers and require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. The laws include federal “sunshine”, or open payments, provisions enacted in 2010 as part of the comprehensive federal healthcare reform legislation and supplemented as part of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act. Such provisions apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government (for re‑disclosure to the public) certain payments made to, or at the request of, or on behalf of, physicians or to teaching hospitals and, commencing for information to be submitted as of January 1, 2022, certain payments made to physicians assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives. Certain state laws also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Given the ambiguity found in many of these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent U.S. federal and state laws and regulations.
 Pricing and Reimbursement
 United States
 In the U.S., sales of our products, including those sold by our licensees, and our ability to generate revenues on such sales are dependent, in significant part, on the availability and level of reimbursement from third‑party payers such as state and federal governments, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Third‑party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and examining the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of medical products, in addition to their safety and efficacy.
 Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low‑income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid rebate program, we are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law as the greater of 23.1% of average manufacturer price (“AMP”) or the difference between AMP and the best price available from us to any commercial or non‑federal governmental customer. The rebate amount must be adjusted upward where the AMP for a product’s first full quarter of sales, when adjusted for increases in the Consumer Price Index—Urban, is less than the AMP for the current quarter, with this difference being the amount by which the rebate is adjusted upwards. The rebate amount is required to be recomputed each quarter based on our report of current AMP and best price for each of our products to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The terms of our participation in the rebate program imposes a requirement on us to report revisions to AMP or best price within a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data was originally due. Any such revisions could have the impact of increasing or decreasing our rebate liability for prior quarters, depending on the direction of the revision. In addition, if we were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties per item of false information in addition to other penalties available to the government. 
 Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part B pays physicians who administer our products under a payment methodology using average sales price (“ASP”) information. Manufacturers, including us, are required to provide ASP information to the CMS on a quarterly basis. This information is used to compute Medicare payment rates, with rates for Medicare Part B drugs outside the hospital outpatient setting and in the hospital outpatient setting consisting of ASP plus a specified percentage. These rates are adjusted periodically. If a manufacturer is found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of ASP, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties for each misrepresentation and for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied.
 24

Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self‑administered drugs (i.e. drugs that do not need to be injected or otherwise administered by a physician) and certain physician-administered drugs reimbursed under a pharmacy benefit. Medicare Part D also covers the prescription drug benefit for dual eligible beneficiaries. Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time‑to‑time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts. Except for dual eligible Medicare Part D beneficiaries who qualify for low-income subsidies, manufacturers, including us, are required to provide a seventy percent (70%) discount on our brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits.
 The availability of federal funds to pay for our products under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B requires that we extend discounts to certain purchasers under the Public Health Services (including the Indian Health Services, “PHS”) pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include a variety of community health clinics, other entities that receive health services grants from PHS, and hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients.
 We also make our products available for purchase by authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) of the General Services Administration pursuant to our FSS contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Under the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (the “VHC Act”), we are required to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing to four federal agencies: the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Defense; the Coast Guard; and the PHS, in order for federal funding to be made available for reimbursement of any of our products by such federal agencies and certain federal grantees. Coverage under Medicaid, the Medicare Part B program and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program is also conditioned upon FSS participation. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that we charge our most‑favored non‑federal customer for a product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TriCare retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing equal to 76% of the non‑federal average manufacturer price (“non‑FAMP”). An additional discount applies if non‑FAMP increases more than inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index—Urban). In addition, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the VHC Act provides for civil monetary penalties per false item of information in addition to other penalties available to the government.
 In addition, on January 21, 2016, CMS released the final Medicaid covered outpatient drug regulation, which became effective on April 1, 2016. This regulation implements those changes made by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”) to the Medicaid drug rebate statute in 2010 and addresses a number of other issues with respect to the Medicaid program, including, but not limited to, the eligibility and calculation methodologies for AMP and best price, and the expansion of Medicaid rebate liability to include Medicaid managed care organizations. The final Medicaid covered outpatient drug regulation established two calculation methodologies for AMP: one for drugs generally dispensed through retail community pharmacies (“RCP”) and one for so-called “5i drugs” (inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injectable drugs) “not generally dispensed” through RCPs. The regulation further made clear that 5i drugs would qualify as “not generally dispensed” and, therefore, able to use the alternative AMP calculation, if not more than thirty percent (30%) of their sales were to RCPs or to wholesalers for RCPs. The primary difference between the two AMP calculations is the requirement to exclude from AMP, for those qualifying 5i drugs not generally dispensed through RCPs, certain payments, rebates and discounts related to sales to non-RCPs; such exclusion often leads to a lower AMP. The decision of which AMP calculation a product is eligible to use must be made and applied on a monthly basis based on the percentage of sales of such product to RCPs or to wholesalers for RCPs.
 U.S. federal and state governments regularly consider reforming healthcare coverage and lessening healthcare costs. Such reforms may include price controls, value-based pricing and changes to the coverage and reimbursement of our products, which may have a significant impact on our business. For example, in November 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act (the “BBBA”). The BBBA includes several provisions that may impact our business, including provisions that create an out-of-pocket cap for seniors, implement a new manufacturer liability (including in Medicare Part D), allow the U.S. government to negotiate prices for some drugs covered under Medicare Part B and Part D, require inflation rebates to limit annual increases in drug prices in Medicare and private insurance, and repeal the rebate rule that would require pass through of pharmacy benefit manager rebates to beneficiaries. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Private insurers regularly seek to manage drug cost and utilization by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations through means including, but not limited to, formularies, increased out‑of‑pocket obligations and various prior authorization requirements. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we have received regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 25

Outside the United States
 Within the EU, products are paid for by a variety of payers, with governments being the primary source of payment. Governments may determine or influence reimbursement of products. Governments may also set prices or otherwise regulate pricing. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization of products. Governments may use a variety of cost‑containment measures to control the cost of products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value‑based pricing and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set a price). Recent budgetary pressures in many EU countries are causing governments to consider or implement various cost‑containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates, and expanded generic substitution and patient cost‑sharing. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost‑containment measures.
Other Regulations
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act: We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), which prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, authorizing, or making payments of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the healthcare professionals with whom we regularly interact may meet the FCPA’s definition of a foreign government official. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.
 Environmental, Health and Safety Laws: Our operations are subject to complex and increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and, in particular, where we have manufacturing facilities, namely the U.S. and Ireland. Environmental and health and safety authorities in the relevant jurisdictions, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the U.S. and the Environmental Protection Agency and the Health and Safety Authority in Ireland, administer laws which regulate, among other matters, the emission of pollutants into the air (including the workplace), the discharge of pollutants into bodies of water, the storage, use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, the exposure of persons to hazardous substances, and the general health, safety and welfare of employees and members of the public. In certain cases, these laws and regulations may impose strict liability for pollution of the environment and contamination resulting from spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances or waste and/or any migration of such hazardous substances or waste. Costs, damages and/or fines may result from the presence, investigation and remediation of contamination at properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by us and/or off‑site locations, including where we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or waste. In addition, we may be subject to third‑party claims, including for natural resource damages, personal injury and property damage, in connection with such contamination.
 The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”): The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018 and replaced the previous EU Data Protection Directive (95/46). The GDPR, which governs the processing of personal data (including personal health data), applies to the Company and any of its subsidiaries that are established in the EU to the extent that they process personal data as well as any of its subsidiaries that are established outside the EU to the extent that they process personal data relating to EU residents for certain purposes, including any such data relating to clinical trial participants in the EU. The GDPR imposes significant obligations on controllers and processors of personal data, including high standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, robust notification requirements to individuals about the processing of their personal data, a strong individual data rights regime, mandatory data breach notifications, limitations on the retention of personal data, stringent requirements pertaining to health data, and strict rules and restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside of the EU, including to the U.S. The GDPR also imposes additional obligations on, and required contractual provisions to be included in, contracts between companies subject to the GDPR and their third-party processors that relate to the processing of personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states to make additional laws and regulations in order to introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data.
 Other Laws: We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure, securities trading regulations and governmental regulations as an Irish-incorporated company publicly-listed in the U.S., including laws relating to the oversight activities of the SEC, the Irish Companies Act 2014, and the regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”), on which our shares are traded. We are also subject to various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work.
Human Capital Resources
 As a global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative medicines in the fields of neuroscience and oncology, we have built, and continue to devote significant resources to further develop and enhance, a comprehensive cross-functional infrastructure designed to support product development from discovery through commercialization and lifecycle management. We seek to attract, hire, develop, recognize and retain qualified and highly skilled personnel with experience in areas 
 26

such as R&D, including early discovery, translational medicine, formulation and clinical development capabilities; intellectual property prosecution, enforcement and defense; medical affairs; manufacturing operations; U.S. federal and state government affairs; sales and marketing; and market access. Competition for such personnel in our industry and the geographic regions in which we operate is intense, with numerous companies also developing, launching or marketing products, including products against which our products directly compete. Supporting our employees’ well-being in a transparent, diverse, inclusive, and collaborative culture and providing them with the training, support and resources they need to succeed professionally, while appropriately balancing their professional and personal lives, helps keep our employees connected and engaged and is critical to our success.
 As of February 4, 2022, we had approximately 2,211 full time employees, of which approximately 1,798 were based in the U.S. and 413 were based in Ireland. Our 2021 global voluntary attrition rate was below industry benchmarks. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 We are an equal opportunity employer and we are fundamentally committed to creating and maintaining a work environment in which employees are treated with respect and dignity. All human resources policies, practices and actions related to hiring, promotion, compensation, benefits and termination are administered in accordance with the principles of equal employment opportunity and other legitimate criteria without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, ethnicity, national origin, ancestry, age, mental or physical disability, genetic information, any veteran status, any military status or application for military service, or membership in any other category protected under applicable laws. 
 Recognizing the value of our employees and their important contributions to the achievement of our business objectives, we offer market-competitive comprehensive total rewards packages, including bonus opportunities at all levels tied to individual and company performance, and for employees at certain levels, company equity opportunities. We are committed to designing and managing our pay programs and decisions to support equitable pay for all employees. We have established our compensation programs based on market and benchmark data and strive to pay all employees equitably, taking into consideration factors such as their role, skills, abilities and relevant experience. We also offer healthcare and retirement savings plan benefits, paid time off, tuition reimbursement and other benefits designed to support healthy lifestyle choices, financial wellness and work-life balance.
 Across all of our sites, we cultivate a work environment that reflects our values of collaboration at our core, respect for each voice and unwavering commitment. Over the past several years, we have continued to focus on fostering an environment that respects and celebrates Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging (“DIB”) in our workplaces and our communities and have actively evolved our DIB strategy to cater to the changing needs of our employees and respond to important external social and cultural events.  In support of this strategy, in 2019, we created a global cross-functional DIB Steering Committee, comprised of representatives from all of our locations, including field-based employees, to create connections, foster conversations, help ensure our efforts are aligned with the diverse range of perspectives within our organization and develop and advance practices, tools and resources that can be used to strengthen the sense of belonging among our employee base. Since 2020, we have established five Employee Resource Groups (ERGs): Limitless, a network for individuals with disabilities and caregivers; Mosaic, a multicultural network; Operation Salute, a veterans network; Pride@Work, an LGBTQ+ network; and Women Inspired Network (WIN), a women’s network. These ERGs share a common purpose of supporting and enhancing the inclusiveness of our company culture and providing opportunities for professional development, networking and building deeper connections within Alkermes. In 2021, we established a DIB Executive Committee, which includes our Chief Executive Officer and other senior leaders, to continue to refine our DIB strategy and champion its implementation and impact across the business.  These groups work together to set goals, establish and execute strategic initiatives, measure our progress and promote a culture of understanding and inclusion throughout our organization.  Additionally, as part of our increased focus on social and racial justice, diversity and inclusion, and in response to global events throughout 2020 and 2021, we held company-wide town hall conversations, sponsored recognition events and enhanced our Company’s diversity education and training. 
 We strive to foster a strong culture of active employee engagement to ensure that employees feel part of our mission and that they have a voice in the Alkermes community. Since 2017, we have conducted annual employee engagement surveys to understand employee sentiment regarding, and satisfaction with, their work and experience at Alkermes. In 2021, over 70% of our employees participated in our employee engagement survey and we have used the data collected to help inform and evolve our human capital management strategy and initiatives.
 We are committed to the professional growth and development of our employees. We conduct a comprehensive on-boarding experience that connects newly hired employees to our business, values, culture, and people. We encourage and support our employees in their adoption of Individual Development Plans designed to identify professional development and growth opportunities to help support their career aspirations. We frequently organize company-hosted trainings that cover topics including performance management, collaboration, leadership development, diversity, communication, and mentorship, and more specialized skills-based programs.  In 2021, we launched a new LinkedIn Learning platform to provide on-demand learning opportunities to our employees.  Since we made this platform available, our employees have, in the aggregate, viewed over 14,000 courses on a wide variety of topics. 
 27

Our culture is one of collaboration and trust. We ask our employees to help us promote and provide workplace environments that are safe and protective of the health and well-being of our people and in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. We maintain extensive environmental, health safety and security policies, adhere to all health and safety standards set by regulators in the locations in which we operate and routinely train employees and monitor our sites to reduce the risk of workplace accidents. 
 In 2021, employee health, safety and wellness continued to be of particular focus and importance for the Company. Following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, we adopted a series of precautionary measures to protect and support our employees, including those performing essential tasks in our laboratories and manufacturing facilities who could not perform their work remotely. In 2021, we adjusted our communication strategies to keep employees connected and informed, including increased communications from leadership and frequent online surveys to measure employee experiences and the effectiveness of our communications. We also enhanced employee resources, including wellness and stress-reduction resources, guidance on how to effectively engage and work remotely, and increased childcare benefits.  For additional information about actions taken by the Company to support its employees and other stakeholders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see the “COVID-19 Update” included in “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report.
