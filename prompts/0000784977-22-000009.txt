ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
Portland General Electric Company (PGE or the Company), a vertically-integrated electric utility with corporate headquarters located in Portland, Oregon, is engaged in the generation, wholesale purchase, transmission, distribution, and retail sale of electricity in the state of Oregon. The Company operates as a cost-based, regulated electric utility with revenue requirements and customer prices determined based on the forecasted cost to serve retail customers and a reasonable rate of return as determined by the Public Utility Commission of Oregon (OPUC). PGE meets its retail load requirement with both Company-owned generation and power purchased in the wholesale market. The Company participates in the wholesale market through the purchase and sale of electricity and natural gas in an effort to obtain reasonably-priced power to serve its retail customers. PGE is committed to developing products and service offerings for the benefit of retail and wholesale customers. PGE, incorporated in 1930, is publicly-owned, with its common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The Company operates as a single business segment, with revenues and costs related to its business activities maintained and analyzed on a total electric operations basis. The Company owns unregulated, non-utility real estate comprised primarily of PGE’s corporate headquarters.
PGE’s state-approved service area allocation of four thousand square miles is located entirely within Oregon and includes 51 incorporated cities. During 2021, the Company added nine thousand customers, and as of December 31, 2021, served a total of 917 thousand retail customers.    
Available Information
PGE’s periodic and current reports, and amendments to those reports, are available and may be accessed free of charge through the Investors section of the Company’s website at PortlandGeneral.com as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It is not intended that PGE’s website and the information contained therein or connected thereto be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Regulation
Federal and state of Oregon (State) regulation each have a significant influence on how PGE’s business operates. In addition to the agencies and activities discussed below, the Company is subject to regulation by certain environmental agencies, as described in the Environmental Matters section in this Item 1.
Federal Regulation 
Several federal agencies, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), have regulatory authority over certain of PGE’s operations and activities, as described in the discussion that follows.
PGE is a “licensee,” a “public utility,” and a “user, owner, and operator of the bulk power system,” as those terms are defined in the Federal Power Act (FPA). As such, the Company is subject to regulation by the FERC in matters related to wholesale energy activities, transmission services, reliability and cybersecurity standards, natural gas pipelines, hydroelectric projects, accounting policies and practices, short-term debt issuances, and certain other matters. 
Wholesale Energy—PGE has authority under its FERC Market-Based Rates tariff to charge market-based rates for wholesale energy sales in all markets in which it sells electricity except in its own Balancing Authority Area (BAA). 
The BAA is the area in which PGE is responsible for balancing customer demand with electricity supply, in real time, and the tariff exception within PGE’s BAA does not have a material impact on the Company. 
Transmission—PGE offers wholesale electricity transmission service pursuant to its Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT), which contains rates, terms, and conditions of service, as filed with, and approved by, the FERC. 
Reliability and Cybersecurity Standards—The FERC has adopted mandatory reliability standards for owners, users, and operators of the bulk power system. Such standards, which are applicable to PGE, were developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC), which have responsibility for compliance and enforcement of these standards, and are intended to help protect critical cyber assets used to support reliable operations. 
Natural Gas Pipelines—The FERC has authority in matters related to the construction, operation, extension, enlargement, safety, and abandonment of jurisdictional interstate natural gas pipeline facilities, as well as transportation rates and accounting for interstate natural gas commerce. PGE is subject to such authority as the Company has a 79.5% ownership interest in the Kelso-Beaver (KB) Pipeline, a 17-mile, 20-inch diameter, interstate pipeline that provides natural gas to Port Westward Unit 1 (PW1), Port Westward Unit 2 (PW2), and Beaver, the Company’s natural gas-fired generating plants located near Clatskanie, Oregon, and to the North Mist storage facility (owned and operated by a local natural gas distribution company). As the operator of record of the KB Pipeline, PGE is subject to the requirements and regulations enacted under the Pipeline Safety Laws administered by the PHMSA, which include safety and operator qualification standards in addition to public awareness requirements.
Hydroelectric Licensing—As required under the FPA, PGE holds FERC licenses for all Company-owned and operated hydroelectric generating plants. The FERC license process includes an extensive public review process that involves the consideration of numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions. For additional information, see the Environmental Matters section in this Item 1. and the Generating Facilities section in Item 2.—“Properties.”
Accounting Policies and Practices—PGE prepares periodic and current reports in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). In addition, the Company prepares, pursuant to applicable provisions of the FPA, financial statements in accordance with the accounting requirements of the FERC, as set forth in its applicable Uniform System of Accounts and published accounting releases. Such financial statements are included in annual and quarterly reports filed with the FERC.
Short-term Debt—Pursuant to applicable provisions of the FPA and FERC regulations, regulated public utilities are required to obtain FERC approval to issue certain securities. For additional information on the Company’s Short-term Debt, see “Short-term Debt” in the Debt and Equity section of Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7.—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
Spent Fuel Storage—The NRC regulates the licensing and decommissioning of nuclear power plants, including PGE’s decommissioned Trojan nuclear power plant (Trojan), which was closed in 1993. For additional information on spent nuclear fuel storage activities, see Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.—“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Hazardous Material” in the Environmental Matters section of this Item 1.
State of Oregon Regulation 
PGE is subject to the jurisdiction of the OPUC, which reviews and approves the Company’s retail prices and reviews the Company’s generation and transmission resource acquisition plans, pursuant to a biennial integrated resource planning process. The OPUC regulates the issuance of securities, prescribes accounting policies and practices, regulates the sale of utility assets, reviews transactions with affiliated companies, and has jurisdiction over the acquisition of, or exertion of substantial influence over, public utilities.
Retail customer prices are determined through formal proceedings that generally include testimony by participating parties, discovery, public hearings, and the issuance of a final order. Participants in such proceedings may include PGE, OPUC staff, and intervenors representing PGE customer groups, as well as other interested parties. The following are the more significant regulatory mechanisms and proceedings under which customer prices are determined:
•General Rate Cases. PGE periodically evaluates the need to change its retail electric price structure as part of a comprehensive general rate case process that reflects revenue requirements based on a forecasted test year. The OPUC authorizes the Company’s debt-to-equity capital structure, return on equity, overall rate of return, and customer prices. 
•Annual Power Cost Updates. The OPUC has approved an Annual Power Cost Update Tariff (AUT) by which PGE can adjust retail customer prices annually to reflect forecasted changes in the Company’s net variable power costs (NVPC). NVPC consists of the cost of power purchased and fuel used to generate electricity, as well as the cost of settled electric and natural gas financial contracts (all classified as Purchased power and fuel expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of income) and is net of wholesale revenues, which are classified in the consolidated statements of income as Revenues, net. The OPUC has also authorized a Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism (PCAM), under which PGE may share with customers a portion of actual cost variances associated with NVPC. 
•Renewable Energy. The State has a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) that requires PGE to serve a portion of its retail load with renewable resources. In conjunction with the RPS, the State established a Renewable Adjustment Clause (RAC) mechanism that allows for the recovery in retail customer prices, outside of a general rate case, of prudently incurred costs to comply with the RPS. 
◦In 2016, the State also passed a law referred to as the Oregon Clean Electricity and Coal Transition Plan (SB 1547), which, among its provisions, increased the RPS percentages in certain future years and required the elimination of coal from Oregon utility customers’ energy supply. For further information on SB 1547, see “RPS Standards and Other Laws” in the Overview section of Item 7.—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
◦During 2021, the State legislature passed House Bill (HB) 2021, which establishes clean energy targets and sets out a framework for PGE and other investor-owned utilities and electric service suppliers in the state. The targets are an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030, 90% by 2035, and 100% by 2040 and every year thereafter. For further information on HB 2021 and the baseline to which the target reductions apply, see “House Bill 2021” in the Environmental Laws and Regulations portion of the Overview section of Item 7.—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Regulatory Accounting
PGE prepares financial statements in accordance with GAAP and, as a regulated public utility, the effects of rate regulation are reflected in its financial statements. GAAP provides for the deferral, as regulatory assets, of certain actual or estimated costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, based on expected recovery from customers in future prices. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise be recognized as revenue or reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on expected future credits or refunds to customers. PGE records regulatory assets or liabilities if it is probable that they will be reflected in future prices, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence.
The Company periodically assesses the applicability of regulatory accounting to its business, considering both the current and anticipated future regulatory environment and related accounting guidance. For additional information, see “Regulatory Assets and Liabilities” in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 7, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.—“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Customers and Revenues
PGE generates revenue primarily through the sale and delivery of electricity to retail customers located exclusively in Oregon. In addition, the Company distributes power to commercial and industrial customers that choose to purchase their energy from an Electricity Service Supplier (ESS). Although the Company includes such Direct Access customers in its customer counts and energy delivered to such customers in its total retail energy deliveries, retail revenues include only delivery charges and applicable transition adjustments for these Direct Access customers. The Company conducts retail electric operations within its service territory and competes with ESSs to supply certain commercial and industrial customer energy needs. In addition, PGE competes with the local natural gas distribution company for the energy needs of residential and commercial space heating, water heating, and appliances. Energy efficiency, conservation measures, and the advancement of distributed generation and storage resources also have an influence on customer demand.
Retail Revenues
Retail customers are classified as residential, commercial, or industrial, with no single customer representing more than 8% of PGE’s total retail revenues or 13% of total retail deliveries. 
PGE’s Retail revenues, retail energy deliveries, and average number of retail customers consist of the following:

For additional information, see the Results of Operations section in Item 7.—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
In addition to standard cost of service pricing, the Company offers different pricing options including a daily market price option, various time-of-use options, and several renewable energy options. For additional information on customer options, see “Customer Choice Programs” within this Customers and Revenues section of this Item 1. 
Residential customers include single family housing, multiple family housing (such as apartments, duplexes, and town homes), mobile homes, and small farms. Residential demand is sensitive to the effects of weather, with demand historically highest during the winter heating season. Increased use of air conditioning in PGE’s service territory has caused the summer peaks to increase over time, while the historical winter peak has not increased in over 20 years. In recent years, summer peaks have exceeded winter peaks and long-term load forecasts expect that trend to continue. Economic conditions can also affect residential demand as job growth and population growth in PGE’s service territory have led to increased customer growth rates. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced additional behavioral patterns as residential customers spend more time at home. Residential demand is also impacted by energy efficiency measures; however, the Company’s decoupling mechanism is intended to mitigate the financial effects of such measures. For further information regarding the decoupling mechanism, see “General Rate Case” in the Overview section of Item 7.—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Commercial customers consist of non-residential customers who accept energy deliveries at voltages equivalent to those delivered to residential customers. This customer class includes most businesses, small industrial companies, and public street and highway lighting accounts. The Company’s commercial customer demand is somewhat less susceptible to weather conditions than residential customer demand. Economic conditions and fluctuations in total employment in the region can also lead to changes in energy demand from commercial customers. Energy efficiency measures also impact commercial demand, although the Company’s decoupling mechanism partially mitigates the financial effects of such measures. For further information regarding the decoupling mechanism, see “General Rate Case” in the Overview section of Item 7.—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Industrial customers consist of non-residential customers who accept delivery at higher voltages than commercial customers, with pricing based on the amount of electricity delivered under the applicable tariff. Demand from 
industrial customers is primarily driven by economic conditions, with weather having little impact on this customer class.
Customer Choice Programs—Under cost of service pricing, residential and small commercial customers may select portfolio options from PGE that include time-of-use and renewable resource pricing.
Pricing options other than cost of service are available to certain commercial and industrial customers for a one-year period, including daily market index-based pricing under which the Company provides the electricity, and Direct Access, whereby customers purchase electricity directly from an ESS. 
PGE receives revenue from Direct Access customers only for the transmission and delivery of the volume of electricity delivered, along with fixed transition adjustments intended to mitigate the shifting of excess charges to the Company’s cost of service customers. Certain large commercial and industrial customers may elect a fixed three-year or a minimum five-year term, to be served either by an ESS, or by the Company under the daily market index-based price option. Participation in the fixed three-year and minimum five-year opt-out programs for existing and planned load is capped at 300 average megawatts (MWa) in aggregate. 
In 2020, the OPUC issued an order that required PGE to begin offering enrollment in the New Large Load Direct Access program, which is capped at 119 MWa, for unplanned, large, new loads and large load growth at existing sites, to eligible customers. 
For further information regarding Direct Access deliveries, see “Customers and Demand” in the Overview section of Item 7.—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
PGE’s customers are committed to purchasing clean energy, as over 235 thousand residential and small commercial customers voluntarily participate in PGE’s Green Future Program, the largest renewable power program by participation in the nation. Oregon’s most populous city, Portland, and most populous county, Multnomah, each passed resolutions to achieve 100 percent clean and renewable electricity by 2035 and 100 percent economy-wide clean and renewable energy by 2050. Other jurisdictions in PGE’s service area have set, or are considering, similar goals. 
In response, the Company implemented a new customer service option, the Green Future Impact Program, which allows for 100 MW of PGE-provided power purchase agreements for renewable resources and up to 200 MW of customer-provided renewable resources. Approved by the OPUC in 2019, the program provides business customers access to bundled renewable attributes from those resources. On March 29, 2021, the OPUC issued an order that expanded the program by 200 MW and provided for the possibility of PGE ownership of the underlying renewable resources under certain conditions. Through this voluntary program, the Company seeks to align sustainability goals, cost and risk management, and reliable integrated power while providing customer choice and a cleaner energy system. In December 2021, the OPUC issued an order, which approved a petition to increase capacity under the customer-provided renewable resources by 250 MW, which would bring the total available capacity under the program to 750 MW. For more information on the Company’s power purchase agreements that currently serve the Green Future Impact Program, see “Green Future Impact Program” within Purchased Power in the Power Supply section of this Item 1.
Wholesale Revenues
PGE participates in the wholesale electricity marketplace in order to balance its supply of power to meet the needs of its retail customers. Interconnected transmission systems in the western United States serve utilities with diverse load requirements and allow the Company to purchase and sell electricity, largely through bi-lateral agreements, within the region to serve retail demand, depending upon the relative price and availability of power, hydro and wind conditions, and daily and seasonal retail demand. PGE also participates in the California Independent System Operator’s western Energy Imbalance Market (western EIM), which allows for load balancing with other western 
EIM participants in five-minute intervals. Wholesale revenues represented 11% of total revenues in 2021 and 8% in both 2020 and 2019. 
Other Operating Revenues
Other operating revenues consist primarily of gains and losses on the sale of natural gas volumes purchased that exceeded what was needed to fuel the Company’s generating facilities, as well as revenues from transmission services, excess transmission capacity resales, pole attachment rentals, and other electric services provided to customers. Other operating revenues represented 3% of total revenues in 2021, 2% in 2020, and 3% in 2019.
Seasonality
Demand for electricity by PGE’s residential and, to a lesser extent, commercial customers, is affected by seasonal weather conditions. The Company uses heating and cooling degree-days to determine the effect of weather on the demand for electricity. Heating and cooling degree-days, determined by taking the difference between the average daily temperature and a baseline of 65 degrees, provide cumulative variances over a period of time, to indicate the extent to which customers are likely to have used electricity for heating or cooling. The higher the number of degree-days, the greater the expected demand for electricity.
The following table presents the heating and cooling degree-days for the most recent three-year period, along with 15-year averages for the most recent year provided by the National Weather Service, as measured at Portland International Airport: 

 | HeatingDegree-Days | CoolingDegree-Days
2021 | 3,828 | 838 
2020 | 3,836 | 600 
2019 | 4,165 | 564 
15-year average | 4,120 | 550 

In June 2021, PGE set a new all-time high net system load peak of 4,447 megawatts (MW), surpassing the previous all-time peak that occurred in December 1998 by over 9%. The Company’s previous summer peak of 3,976 MW occurred in August 2017. The following table presents PGE’s average winter (defined as January, February, and December) and summer (defined as June through September) loads for the periods presented, along with the corresponding peak load (in MWs) and month in which such peak occurred. As the table below illustrates, although the average winter loads continue to run higher than average summer loads, the Company continues to experience its highest annual peak loads during the summer months: 

 | Winter Loads | Summer Loads
 | Average | Peak | Month | Average | Peak | Month
2021 | 2,657 | 3,619 | December | 2,487 | 4,447 | June 
2020 | 2,566 | 3,367 | December | 2,289 | 3,771 | July 
2019 | 2,609 | 3,422 | February | 2,263 | 3,765 | June 

The Company tracks and evaluates both load growth and peak load requirements for purposes of long-term load forecasting, integrated resource planning, and preparing general rate case assumptions. Behavior patterns, conservation, energy efficiency initiatives and measures, weather effects, economic conditions, and demographic changes all play a role in determining expected future customer demand and the resulting resources the Company will need to adequately meet those loads and maintain adequate capacity reserves.
Power Supply
PGE utilizes its generating resources, as well as wholesale power purchases from third parties to meet the needs of its retail customers. The volume of electricity the Company generates is dependent upon, among other factors, the 
capacity and availability of its generating resources and the price and availability of wholesale power and natural gas. As part of its power supply operations, the Company enters into short- and long-term power and fuel purchase and sale agreements. PGE executes economic dispatch decisions concerning its own generation and participates in the wholesale market in an effort to obtain reasonably-priced power for its retail customers, manage risk, and administer its long-term wholesale contracts. The Company also performs portfolio management and wholesale market sales services for third parties in the region. The Company also encourages energy efficiency measures to help meet its energy requirements and promotes the use of various demand side management products to reduce load during peak time usage.
PGE’s resource and contracted capacity (in MW) was as follows:

For information regarding actual generating output and purchases for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, see the Results of Operations section of Item 7.—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Generation
PGE’s generating resources consist of six thermal plants (natural gas- and coal-fired), three wind farms, and seven hydroelectric facilities. The portion of PGE’s retail load requirements generated by its plants varies from year to year and is determined by various factors, including planned and unplanned outages, availability and price of coal and natural gas, precipitation and snow-pack levels, the market price of electricity, and wind variability. For a complete listing of these facilities, see “Generating Facilities” in Item 2.—“Properties.”
Thermal    The Company has five natural gas-fired generating facilities: PW1, PW2, Beaver, Coyote Springs Unit 1 (Coyote Springs), and Carty Generating Station (Carty). 
The Company operated, and continues to have a 90% ownership interest in the Boardman coal-fired generating plant (Boardman), which ceased coal-fired operations during the fourth quarter of 2020. The Company has begun decommissioning the facility. The Company also has a 20% ownership interest in the Colstrip Units 3 and 4 coal-fired generating plant (Colstrip), which is located in Colstrip, Montana and operated by a third party. For additional information on Colstrip as it relates to environmental laws and regulations in the state of Oregon, see “RPS Standards and Other Laws” in the Overview section in Item 7.—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 19, Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.—“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Wind PGE owns and operates two wind farms, Biglow Canyon Wind Farm (Biglow Canyon) and Tucannon River Wind Farm (Tucannon River). Biglow Canyon, located in Sherman County, Oregon, consists of 217 turbines with a total nameplate capacity of 450 MW. Tucannon River, located in southeastern Washington, consists of 116 turbines with a total nameplate capacity of 267 MW. During 2020, the wind component of the Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facility (Wheatridge), located in Morrow County, Oregon, was placed into service. Although PGE does not operate Wheatridge, it now owns 40 turbines with a total nameplate capacity of 100 MW and purchases the output of the remaining turbines, with a capacity of 200 MWs through power purchase agreements. For additional information on Wheatridge, see “The Resource Planning Process” in the Overview section in Item 7.—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Hydro    The Company’s FERC-licensed hydroelectric projects consist of Pelton/Round Butte on the Deschutes River near Madras, Oregon (discussed below), four plants on the Clackamas River, and one on the Willamette River. 
As of December 31, 2021, PGE had a 66.67% ownership interest in the 455 MW Pelton/Round Butte hydroelectric project on the Deschutes River, with the remaining interest held by the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon (CTWS). A 50-year joint license for the project, which is operated by PGE, was issued by the FERC in 2005. The CTWS had an option to purchase an additional undivided 16.66% ownership interest in Pelton/Round Butte in 2021, and closed on the purchase of this incremental undivided ownership interest on January 1, 2022. As a result, PGE’s ownership interest in the project is now 50.01%. CTWS has a second option in 2036 to purchase an undivided 0.02% interest in Pelton/Round Butte. If the second option is exercised, CTWS’s ownership percentage would exceed 50%. PGE purchases 100% of the CTWS’s share of the project output. For more information see “CTWS” within Purchased Power in the Power Supply section of this Item 1.
Fuel Supply—PGE contracts for natural gas and coal supplies required to fuel the Company’s thermal generating plants, with certain plants also able to operate on fuel oil, if needed. In addition, the Company uses forward, future, swap, and option contracts to manage its exposure to volatility in natural gas prices.
Natural Gas    Physical supplies of natural gas are generally purchased up to twelve months in advance of delivery and based on anticipated operation of the plants. PGE manages the price risk of natural gas supply through the use of financial contracts up to 60 months in advance of expected need of energy.
PGE owns 79.5%, and is the operator of record, of the KB Pipeline, which directly connects PW1, PW2, and Beaver to the Northwest Pipeline, an interstate natural gas pipeline operating between British Columbia and New Mexico. Currently, PGE transports natural gas on the KB Pipeline for its own use under a firm transportation service agreement, with capacity offered to others on an interruptible basis to the extent not utilized by the Company. PGE has access to 111,805 Dth per day of firm natural gas transportation capacity on the Northwest Pipeline to serve the three plants.
PGE has access to 4.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage in Mist, Oregon from which it can draw when economic factors favor its use or in the event that natural gas supplies are interrupted. The storage facility, owned and operated by NW Natural, may be utilized to provide fuel to PW1, PW2, and Beaver. 
To serve Coyote Springs and Carty, PGE has access to 120,000 Dth per day of firm natural gas transportation capacity on three pipeline systems accessing gas fields in Alberta, Canada. 
Coal The Colstrip co-owners obtain coal to fuel the plant via conveyor belt from a mine that lies adjacent to the facility and is the sole source of coal supply for the plant. The coal supply contract with the owner of the mine is scheduled to expire at the end of 2025. The terms of the contract and the quality of coal are expected to allow the facility to operate within required emissions limits. 
    Purchased Power
PGE supplements its own generation with power purchased in the wholesale market to meet its retail load requirements. The Company utilizes short- and long-term wholesale power purchase contracts in an effort to provide the most favorable economic mix on a variable cost basis. 
PGE’s medium-term power cost strategy helps mitigate the effect of price volatility on its customers due to changing energy market conditions. The strategy allows the Company to take positions in power and fuel markets up to five years in advance of physical delivery. By purchasing a portion of anticipated energy needs for future years over an extended period, PGE mitigates a portion of the potential future volatility in the average cost of purchased power and fuel.
The Company’s major power purchase contracts consist of the following (also see the preceding table which summarizes the average resource capabilities related to these contracts): 
Hydro—During 2021, the Company had the following agreements: 
•Public Utility Districts—PGE has long-term power purchase contracts with certain public utility districts (PUDs) in the state of Washington for a portion of the output of two hydroelectric projects on the mid-Columbia River. Although the projects currently provide PGE a total of 404 MW of capacity through contracts as shown below, actual energy received is dependent upon river flows and capacity amounts may decline over time:
◦165 MW of capacity with Grant County PUD that expires in 2052;
◦139 MW of capacity with Douglas County PUD that expires in 2028; and
◦100 MW of capacity with Douglas County PUD that expires in 2025.
•CTWS—PGE has a long-term agreement under which the Company purchases CTWS’ interest in the output of the Pelton/Round Butte hydroelectric project. Although the agreement provides approximately 162 MW of net capacity, actual energy received is dependent upon river flows. The term of the agreement coincides with the term of the FERC license for this project, which 
expires in 2055. Under a separate PPA executed in 2014, PGE pays fixed capacity and energy charges to CTWS for 100% of its share of the project through 2024. On June 30, 2021 the CTWS notified PGE of their intent to exercise their option to purchase an additional undivided 16.66% ownership interest in Pelton/Round Butte and closed on the purchase on January 1, 2022. As a result of the sale, capacity from company-owned generation will decrease by approximately 76 MW, and capacity from purchased power will increase by a corresponding amount. Under the PPA, PGE will purchase 100% of the CTWS’s additional share of the project and payments under the PPA will increase proportionately. In the fourth quarter of 2021, PGE and CTWS executed an additional 16-year PPA which begins on January 1, 2025, that effectively extends the term from 2024 to 2040 and increases the capacity payments in the extension period. 
•Other—The remaining capacity is primarily comprised of two additional contracts that provide for the purchase of power generated from hydroelectric projects with capacity of 236 MW in total:
◦200 MW of capacity with Bonneville Power Administration that expires in 2024; and
◦36 MW of capacity with Portland Hydro that expires in 2032
PURPA qualifying facilities—PGE is required to purchase power from PURPA qualifying facilities (QFs), as mandated by federal law. QFs are generating facilities that fall within the following two categories: i) qualifying generation facilities with a capacity of 80 MW or less and whose primary energy source is renewable (hydro, wind, solar, biomass, waste, or geothermal); or ii) qualifying cogeneration facilities that sequentially produce electricity and another form of useful thermal energy (e.g., heat, steam) in a way that is more efficient than the separate production of each form of energy. As of December 31, 2021, PGE had contracts with 67 on-line QFs, providing a total of 298 MW of capacity. As of December 31, 2021, PGE has nine contracts with QFs representing 70 MW of capacity that are not yet operational, of which one of the QF PPAs is in default because the QF has failed to complete construction and become operational by the date required by the PPA. The PPAs provide that the QF has one year to cure its default. If the QF has failed to cure, PGE is permitted to immediately terminate the QF PPA upon expiration of the cure period. The term of a QF PPA generally ranges from 15 to 23 years, measured from the date of execution. 
The expense and volume of purchases from QFs for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: 

 | 2021 | 2020 
PURPA contract expense (in millions) | $ | 55 | | $ | 43 
MWh purchased under PURPA contracts (in thousands) | 683 | | 498 | 
Average cost per MWh from PURPA contracts | $ | 79.89 | | $ | 85.31

Expenses incurred related to PURPA contracts are included in PGE’s AUT.
Dispatchable Standby Generation (DSG)—PGE has a DSG program under which the Company can start, operate, and monitor customer-owned backup generators when needed to provide NERC-required operating reserves. As of December 31, 2021, there were 60 customer-owned sites with a total DSG capacity of 130 MW. PGE continues to pursue expansion of the program with the goal of having an additional 3 to 10 MW of customer-owned DSG projects online by the end of 2022.
Capacity—PGE has one capacity contract representing up to 100 MW of seasonal capacity during the summer and winter peak periods obtained from a natural gas-fired resource, which expires in 2024.
Wind—PGE has three contracts representing 300 MW of capacity to purchase power generated from renewable wind resources that extend to 2028, 2035, and 2050. The expected energy from these wind resources will vary from the nameplate capacity due to varying wind conditions.
Solar—PGE has three contracts representing seven MW of capacity to purchase power generated from photovoltaic solar projects that extend to 2036 and 2037. The expected energy from these solar resources will vary from the nameplate capacity due to varying solar conditions. Construction on the solar and battery components of Wheatridge, which will supply the Company with an additional 50 MW and 30 MW of capacity, respectively, is ongoing and expected to be completed in early 2022. This additional solar and battery capacity is not reflected in the table above. Subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC own the solar and battery components, and will sell their portion of the output to PGE.
Biomass—PGE has one contract to purchase biomass energy that is set to expire in 2022.
Green Future Impact Program— PGE has two contracts representing 300 MW of capacity to purchase power generated from renewable resources to support the Green Future Impact Program:
•a 15-year contract with Avangrid Renewables representing 162 MW from a renewable energy facility in Gilliam County, Oregon that is expected to be placed in service in May 2022. This additional capacity is not reflected in the table above; and
•a 15-year contract with Avangrid Renewables representing 138 MW from a renewable solar facility in Wasco County, Oregon that is expected to be placed in service in December 2022. This additional capacity is not reflected in the table above.
For additional information on the Green Future Impact Program, see “Customer Choice Programs” within the Customers and Revenues section of this Item 1.
Short-term contracts—These contracts are for delivery periods of one month up to one year in length. They are entered into with various counterparties to provide additional firm energy to help meet the Company’s load requirements.
PGE also utilizes spot purchases of power in the open market to secure the energy required to serve its retail customers. Such purchases are made under contracts that range in duration from 15 minutes to less than one month. PGE is a market participant in the western EIM, which allows certain of the Company’s generating plants to receive automated dispatch signals from the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) for load balancing with other western EIM participants in five-minute intervals. 
For additional information regarding PGE’s power purchase contracts, see Note 16, Commitments and Guarantees and Note 17, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.—“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Future Energy Resource Strategy
PGE’s Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) outlines the Company’s plan to meet future customer demand and describes PGE’s future energy supply strategy. For a detailed discussion of the IRPs, see “The Resource Planning Process” within the Overview section of Item 7.—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Transmission and Distribution
Transmission systems deliver energy from generating facilities to distribution systems for final delivery to customers. PGE schedules energy deliveries over its transmission system in accordance with FERC requirements and operates one BAA in its service territory. In 2021, PGE delivered approximately 26 million megawatt hours (MWh) through 1,274 circuit miles of transmission lines operating at or above 115 kilovolts (kV).
PGE’s transmission system is part of the Western Interconnection, the regional grid in the western United States. The Western Interconnection includes the interconnected transmission systems of 11 western states, two Canadian 
provinces and parts of Mexico, and is subject to the reliability rules of the WECC and the NERC. PGE relies on transmission contracts with Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) to transmit a significant amount of the Company’s generation to serve its distribution system. PGE’s transmission system, together with contractual rights on other transmission systems, enables the Company to integrate and access generation resources to meet its customers’ energy requirements. PGE’s generation is managed on a coordinated basis to obtain maximum load-carrying capability and efficiency. 
The Company’s wholesale transmission activities are regulated by the FERC and are offered on a non-discriminatory basis, with all potential customers provided equal access to PGE’s transmission system through PGE’s OATT. In accordance with its OATT, PGE offers several transmission services to wholesale customers, including:
•Network integration transmission service, a service that integrates generating resources to serve retail loads;
•Short- and long-term firm point-to-point transmission service, a service with fixed delivery and receipt points; and
•Non-firm point-to-point service, an “as available” service with fixed delivery and receipt points.
For additional information regarding the Company’s transmission and distribution facilities, see “Transmission and Distribution” in Item 2.—“Properties.”
Environmental Matters
PGE’s operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws and regulations, which pertain to air and water quality, endangered species and wildlife protection, and hazardous material. Various state and federal agencies regulate environmental matters that relate to the siting, construction, and operation of generation, transmission, and substation facilities and the handling, accumulation, clean-up, and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances. In addition, certain of the Company’s hydroelectric projects and transmission facilities are located on property under the jurisdiction of federal and state agencies, and/or tribal entities that have authority in environmental protection matters. The following discussion provides further information on certain regulations that affect the Company’s operations and facilities.
Air Quality
Clean Air Act—PGE’s operations, primarily its thermal generating plants, are subject to regulation under the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), which addresses particulate matter, hazardous air pollutants, and GHG emissions, among other things. Oregon and Montana, the states in which PGE’s thermal facilities are located, also implement and administer certain portions of the CAA and have set standards that are at least as stringent as federal standards. PGE manages its air emissions at its thermal generating plants by the use of low sulfur fuel, emissions and combustion controls and monitoring, and sulfur dioxide allowances awarded under the CAA.
Climate Change—In 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released the Clean Power Plan (CPP), under which each state would have to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from its power sector on a state-wide basis. In 2016, the United States Supreme Court halted implementation and enforcement of the CPP. 
In 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, to repeal and replace the CPP and, in 2019, finalized the ACE rule, which established guidelines for states to develop plans to address GHG emissions from existing coal-fired plants, such as Colstrip in the case of PGE. With the finalization of the ACE rule, the CPP was repealed. However, on January 19, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule and remanded it, in full, back to the EPA. Notwithstanding objections from the Biden administration that the EPA intended to issue a new rule that takes recent changes in the electricity sector into account, on October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of the D.C. Circuit decision. Oral argument in the case is scheduled for February 28, 2022 with a decision expected during the summer of 2022.
PGE will assess the Supreme Court’s decision, as well as the EPA’s response, for impacts on Colstrip and the Company’s existing natural gas fleet.
Any laws that would impose taxes or mandatory reductions in GHG emissions may have a material impact on PGE’s operations, as the Company utilizes fossil fuels in its own power generation and other companies use such fuels to generate power that PGE purchases in the wholesale market. If incremental costs were incurred as a result of changes in the regulations regarding GHG emissions, the Company would seek recovery in customer prices. 
For more information regarding GHG emissions and related environmental regulation, including Oregon’s RPS and the Company’s goals in this area, see “Renewable Energy” in the Regulation section of this Item 1. and “Company Strategy” in the Overview section of Item 7.—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Water Quality
The federal Clean Water Act requires that any federal license or permit to conduct an activity that may result in a discharge to waters of the United States must first receive a water quality certification or permit from the state in which the activity will occur. In Oregon, Montana, and Washington, the Departments of Environmental Quality and Department of Ecology are responsible for reviewing proposed projects under such requirements to ensure that federally approved activities will meet water quality standards and policies established by the respective state. PGE has obtained permits or certificates of compliance for its hydroelectric operations under the FERC licenses and continues to monitor and update equipment to meet federal and state standards. 
Threatened and Endangered Species and Wildlife
Fish Protection—The federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) has granted protection to many populations of migratory fish species in the Pacific Northwest. Long-term recovery plans for these species continue to have operational impacts on many of the region’s hydroelectric projects. PGE continues to implement fish protection measures at its hydroelectric projects that were prescribed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service under their authority granted in the ESA and the FPA. Conditions required with the operating licenses are expected to result in a minor reduction in power production and continued capital spending to modify the facilities to enhance fish passage and survival.
Avian Protection—Various statutes, including the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, contain provisions for civil, criminal, and administrative penalties resulting from the unauthorized take of migratory birds and eagles. Because PGE operates facilities that can pose risks to a variety of such birds, the Company developed an Avian Protection Plan to help address and reduce risks to bird species that may be affected by Company operations. PGE has implemented such a plan for its transmission, distribution, and thermal generation facilities and additional, specific plans for its wind generation facilities. 
Hazardous Material
PGE has a comprehensive program to comply with requirements of both federal and state regulations related to the storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials. The handling and disposal of hazardous materials from Company facilities is subject to regulation under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In addition, the use, disposal, and clean-up of polychlorinated biphenyls, contained in certain electrical equipment, are regulated under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act.
PGE is also subject to regulation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, commonly referred to as Superfund, which provides authority to the EPA to assert joint and several liability for investigation and remediation costs for designated Superfund sites. 
An investigation by the EPA that began in 1997 of a segment of the Willamette River in Oregon known as Portland Harbor, revealed significant contamination of river sediments and prompted the EPA to designate Portland Harbor as a Superfund site. The EPA has listed PGE among the more than one hundred Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) in this matter, as PGE historically owned or operated property near the river. For additional information regarding the EPA action on Portland Harbor, see Note 19, Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.—“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
PGE is subject to regulation by the United States Department of Energy (USDOE), which, under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, is responsible for the permanent storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel. PGE has contracted with the USDOE for permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel from Trojan that is stored in the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI), an NRC-licensed interim dry storage facility that houses the fuel at the former plant site. The NRC approved the transfer of spent nuclear fuel from a spent fuel pool to the ISFSI where it is expected to remain until permanent off-site storage is available. Shipment of the spent nuclear fuel from the ISFSI to off-site storage is not expected to be completed prior to 2059. For additional information regarding this matter, see “Trojan decommissioning activities” in Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.—“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Human Capital Management
PGE’s talent and culture are vital to its ability to execute its business strategy and realize continued success. Accordingly, the Company seeks to attract and retain a talented, motivated, and diverse workforce and maintain a culture that reflects PGE’s core values, drive for performance, and commitment to acting with the highest levels of honesty, integrity, and compliance. 
Employees and Collective Bargaining Agreements—PGE had 2,839 employees in its workforce as of December 31, 2021, with 678 employees covered under one of two separate agreements with Local Union No. 125 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). The agreements cover 614 and 64 employees and expire March 2022 and August 2022, respectively. The partnership with IBEW is key to a holistic labor relations approach. In addition, PGE utilizes independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement its workforce.
Competitive Pay and Benefits—PGE is committed to pay equity among its employees and offers a wide range of market-competitive benefits, including comprehensive health and welfare benefits and a 401(k) retirement plan, designed to support the physical, mental, and financial well-being of its employees. PGE also has an Employee Assistance Program that provides free and confidential wellness counseling to eligible employees and their families.
Talent Development—PGE provides a variety of training and development programs for employees, as well as tuition reimbursement for job-related coursework. PGE offers a mentorship program for all regular, non-represented PGE employees to help support their growth and development. The PGE Board of Directors oversees executive talent development with the assistance of the Nominating, Governance, and Sustainability Committee and the Compensation and Human Resources Committee in an effort to maximize the pool of internal candidates. At least annually, the Board conducts reviews of succession plans for senior management, which includes a review of the qualifications and development plans of potential internal candidates and diversity of the succession pipeline. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee regularly conducts more in-depth reviews of development plans for promising management talent. PGE conducts employee engagement surveys periodically to give employees the opportunity to share their perspectives and provide feedback. Survey results are shared with PGE management so that managers can take action towards improving the employee experience.
Health and Safety—PGE is committed to providing a safe and healthy place of business for employees, customers, and the public. Management has established an Executive Safety Council that has oversight of the Company’s efforts to create a safe workplace. In addition, PGE provides various safety resources to its employees, such as safety manuals, trainings, and incident reporting tools that are all designed to incorporate safe practices into all daily activities and promote in all employees a sense of personal commitment, responsibility, and obligation regarding safety. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion—PGE promotes an inclusive workforce through pay equity practices, racial equity training, and development opportunities for women and people of color to advance into management. Black, Indigenous, and People of Color comprise over 25% of its employees and nearly 23% of management. One third of its employees and over 34% of its management, including its CEO, are female. PGE also promotes diversity and economic development through its suppliers. The Company’s supplier diversity program ensures opportunity in all competitive bid events for qualified minority-owned, women-owned, disabled veteran-owned, and emerging small business suppliers. 
COVID-19—Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, PGE has taken steps to protect employees by making changes to work schedules, work locations, cleaning practices, work protocols, and information services—including encouraging employees to take advantage of its comprehensive health, wellness, family, and leave programs. The Company continues to prioritize the health and safety of its employees and be informed by federal, state and local officials to align its efforts with current information.
