Item 1. | Business


We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 3, 2004 and commenced operations on January 1, 2005. Our principal executive offices are located at 1250 Broadway, 29th Floor, New York, NY 10001. For convenience in this report, the terms “Company,” “Varonis,” “we” and “us” may be used to refer to Varonis Systems, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries, except where indicated otherwise. Our telephone number is (877) 292-8767.

Overview

Varonis is a pioneer in data security and analytics, fighting a different battle than conventional cybersecurity companies. We are pioneers because more than 15 years ago we recognized that enterprise capacity to create and share data far exceeded its capacity to protect it. We believed that rapid data growth combined with increasing information dependence would change both the global economy and the risk profiles of corporations and governments. This conviction has only strengthened over time. Since our founding, our focus has been on using innovation to address the cyber-implications of these trends, creating software that provides new ways to track, alert and protect data wherever it is stored. 
Data continues to grow in new and existing data stores both on-premises and in the cloud, a trend we have seen accelerate as companies around the world undergo a wave of digital transformation initiatives which have significantly impacted how they must approach data security. These data stores facilitate rapid collaboration from a hybrid workforce, but as these data stores grow in size and criticality, the relationships between the data they hold and the users that collaborate with it grow more complex, making those relationships difficult to visualize, understand and control without automation. 
In addition to data growth, companies face an environment where threat actors continue to refine their strategies to monetize sensitive data, as well as the risk of substantial fines for noncompliance with data-centric regulations. At the same time, organizations are seeing a global scarcity of in-house technical expertise, as the demand for cybersecurity professionals significantly outpaces supply, and IT and security experts are under pressure to solve growing problems with fewer resources. We believe that these trends provide us a long-term opportunity to fulfill our mission of protecting sensitive data for customers, regardless of size, industry or region.
Because enterprises now use many different combinations of data stores and require varying levels of automated protection, our offering provides coverage flexibility through software licensing. We aim to keep pace with the relentless growth and complexity of data, starting in 2005 with a single license, offering ten licenses at the time of our initial public offering in 2014, and today offering more than 35 licenses across the most common on-premises and cloud data stores and applications. In 2021, we launched our DatAdvantage Cloud solution that centrally monitors and protects data across multiple Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") applications, as well as Data Classification Cloud to help automatically identify sensitive information. We plan to continue investing in product development to deliver new products and to enhance our existing products.
Our software specializes in data protection, threat detection and response, data privacy and compliance. Varonis software enables enterprises to protect data stored on-premises and in the cloud including: sensitive files and emails; confidential personal data belonging to customers, patients and employees; financial records; strategic and product plans; and other intellectual property. Recognizing the complexities of securing data, we have built an integrated platform for security and analytics to simplify and streamline security and data management.

The Varonis Data Security Platform, built on patented technology, helps enterprises protect data against cyberattacks from both internal and external threats. Our products enable enterprises to analyze data, account activity and user behavior to detect and prevent attacks. Our Data Security Platform prevents or limits unauthorized use of sensitive information, detects and prevents potential cyberattacks and limits potential damage by automatically locking down data, allowing access to only those who need it and automating the removal of stale data when it is no longer useful. Our products efficiently sustain a secure state with automation and address additional important use cases including data protection, data governance, Zero Trust, compliance, data privacy, classification and threat detection and response. Our Data Security Platform is driven by a proprietary technology, our Metadata Framework, that extracts critical metadata, or data about data, from an enterprise’s information technology ("IT") infrastructure. Our Data Security Platform uses this contextual information to map functional relationships among employees, data objects, systems, content and usage. In doing so, our platform provides real-time intelligence about an enterprise’s massive volumes of data, making it more secure, accessible and manageable. 

We believe that the technology underlying our Data Security Platform, along with the technical experts within the Company who continue to expand and improve our platform, is our primary competitive advantage. The strength of our solution is driven by several proprietary technologies and methodologies that we have developed, coupled with how we have combined them into our highly versatile platform. Our belief in our technological advantage stems from us having developed a way to do each of the following:

•analyze the relationships between users and data with sophisticated algorithms, including cluster analyses and machine learning;
•visualize and depict the analyses in an intuitive manner, including simulating contemplated changes and automatically executing tasks that are becoming increasingly more complex for IT and business personnel;
•identify and automatically classify data as sensitive, critical, private or regulated, to help organizations ensure compliance with regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA");
•automate remediation to directory service objects and access controls on large file systems to safely ensure a Zero Trust or least privilege model;
•profile users, devices and data to detect suspicious account behavior and unusual file and email activity using deep analysis of metadata, machine learning and user behavior analytics; 
•profile cloud configuration and interconnectivity to identify potential exposure and abuse;
•generate meaningful, actionable alerts when security-related incidents are detected; 
•enable security teams to investigate and respond to cyber threats more quickly and conclusively;
•automatically respond to severe incidents like ransomware to limit potential impact and reduce recovery times;
•determine relevant metadata and security information to capture without impacting the enterprise's computing and network infrastructure;
•modify and enrich that metadata in a way that makes it comparable and analyzable despite it having originated from disparate IT systems, and create supplemental metadata, as needed, when the existing IT infrastructure’s activity logs are insufficient;
•decipher the key functional relationships of metadata, the underlying data, and its creators; and
•use those functional relationships to create a graphical depiction, or map, of the data that will endure as enterprises continuously add large volumes of data to their network and storage resources.
The broad applicability of our technology has resulted in our customers deploying our platform for numerous use cases. These use cases include: automatic discovery and classification of high-risk, sensitive data; automated remediation of over-exposed data; centralized visibility and risk analysis of enterprise data and monitoring of user behavior and file activity; security monitoring and risk reduction; data breach, insider threat, malware and ransomware detection; automatic response to ransomware and other severe incidents to limit exposure and reduce recovery times; data ownership identification, assignment, and automatic involvement; forensics, reporting and auditing with searchable logs; meeting security policy and compliance regulation; automatic data migration; cloud migration; automation of retention and disposition policies; automatic data quarantine; intelligent archiving; and automated indexing for data subject requests related to privacy and compliance requirements.
We sell substantially all of our products and services to channel partners, including distributors and resellers, which sell to end-user customers, which we refer to in this report as our customers. We believe that our sales model, which combines the leverage of a channel sales model with our highly trained and professional sales force, has and will continue to play a major role in our ability to grow and to successfully deliver our unique value proposition for securing enterprise data. While our products serve customers of all sizes, in all industries and all geographies, the marketing focus and majority of our sales focus is on targeting organizations with 1,000 users or more who can make larger initial purchases with us and, over time, have a greater potential lifetime value. Our customers span leading firms in the financial services, public, healthcare, industrial, insurance, energy and utilities, technology, consumer and retail, media and entertainment and education sectors. We believe our existing customer base serves as a strong source of incremental revenues given our broad platform of products, the growing volumes and complexity of their enterprise data and the associated security concerns.
In the first quarter of 2019, to deliver on the customer demand to purchase a greater number of our software licenses, we announced our transition to a subscription-based business model, whereby the customer has the right to use our software over a designated period of time. As we have completed this transition, our subscription revenues now account for substantially all of our total license revenues.
Size of Our Market Opportunity
The International Data Corporation’s Global DataSphere Forecast, 2021-2025 (the "study") predicts that global data creation and replication will grow to 181 Zettabytes (or 181 trillion Gigabytes) in 2025. This is up from its earlier forecast of 175 Zettabytes in the prior year and compared to 45 Zettabytes in 2019. We expect this growth to continue further creating a need for technologies that use automation to protect and manage data.
We believe that the diverse functionalities offered by our platform position us at the intersection of several powerful trends in the digital universe. We further believe that the business intelligence and functionalities delivered by our platform 
define a new market. Although we are not aware of any third party studies that accurately define our addressable market, the functionality of our software platform, including our expansion to support cloud applications and data stores, overlaps with portions of several established and growing enterprise software markets as defined in 2021 by Gartner, Inc., including application software ($50.1 billion), security software ($49.7 billion), IT operations management ($33.9 billion), infrastructure software ($23.3 billion), storage management ($15.5 billion), content services ($7.0 billion), data integration ($5.8 billion) and cloud access and cloud workload protection software ($2.2 billion). We believe that our comprehensive product offering will attract a meaningful portion of this overall spend, and we estimate that our total addressable market is approximately 20% of these markets. We have also attempted to measure our total addressable market by utilizing estimates from Forrester regarding the number of companies in North America and Europe that fit our target criteria, and then assuming that each customer purchases the double-digit number of licenses that we aim to sell to all of our customers. In both the “top-down” approach utilizing Gartner industry spend estimates, and the “bottoms-up” approach utilizing Forrester customer estimates, we estimate a total addressable market of more than $37.0 billion. 
Our Technology

Our proprietary technology extracts critical information about an enterprise’s data and its supporting infrastructure, and uses this contextual information, or metadata, to create a functional map of an enterprise’s data and underlying file systems. Our Metadata Framework technology has been architected to process large volumes of enterprise data and the related metadata at a massive scale with minimal demands on the existing IT infrastructure.
Key Benefits of Our Technology

Data Protection
Comprehensive Solution for Managing and Protecting Enterprise Data. Our products enable a broad range of functionality, including data governance, least privilege and Zero Trust, as well as intelligent retention. Moreover, our solution is applicable across most major enterprise data stores and SaaS applications (Windows, UNIX/Linux, Intranets, email systems, Microsoft 365, including SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business, Salesforce, AWS, Google Drive and Box).

Actionable Insight and Automation. Our products help customers identify and prioritize risks to their data and automatically remediate exposures so that they are less vulnerable to internal and external threats, more compliant and consistently follow a least privilege model. Because of the complexity present in even modest enterprises, we believe that effective remediation is impossible at scale without intelligent automation.
Visibility and Data Monitoring Capabilities All in One Place. Our solution combines analysis from disparate on-premises and cloud stores and infrastructure and presents them in a single view, even as data storage and user access become more dispersed and complex in hybrid environments. 

Fast Time to Value and Low Total Cost of Ownership. Our solutions do not require custom implementations or long deployment cycles. Our Data Security Platform can be installed within hours and allows customers to realize real value once used. We designed our platform to operate on commodity hardware on-premises or in the cloud, with standard operating systems, further reducing the cost of ownership of our product.

Ease of Use. While we utilize complex data structures and algorithms in our data engine, we abstract that complexity to provide a sleek, intuitive interface. Our software is accessible through either a local client or a standard web browser and requires limited training, saving time and cost and making it accessible to a broader set of users.
Highly Scalable and Flexible Data Engine. Our metadata analysis technology is built to be highly scalable and flexible, allowing our customers to analyze vast amounts of enterprise data. Moreover, our proprietary platform is built with a modular architecture, allowing customers to grow into the full capabilities of our solutions over time.
Threat Detection and Response
Threat Detection and Response with User, Data and System Context. Our solutions combine classification and data access governance with User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) on data stores, cloud applications, directory services and perimeter devices, including Domain Name System ("DNS"), VPN and web proxy, for accurate detection and risk reduction. Our solutions reduce risk relating to unauthorized use and cyberattacks and reduce incident time to detection (TTD) and time to resolution (TTR).
Protect Data from Insider Threats, Data Breaches, Malware and Cyberattacks. Our solutions analyze how employee accounts, service accounts and admin accounts use and access data, profile employees’ roles and file contents, baseline “normal” behavior patterns, and alert on significant deviations from profiled behaviors. Our customers are able to detect advanced persistent threats (APTs), cybercriminals, rogue insiders, attackers that have compromised internal systems and employee accounts, malware, ransomware and other significant threats.
Compliance 
Discover and Identify Regulated Data. Our solutions automatically discover, identify and classify sensitive, critical and regulated data to help meet privacy and compliance requirements.
Monitor and Detect Security Vulnerabilities. Our solutions analyze, monitor, detect and report on potential security vulnerabilities: helping companies achieve compliance by creating full audit trails, achieving a least privilege model and locking down sensitive data to only those who need it, and facilitate breach notification and security investigations. By ensuring least privilege, monitoring all access and alerting on potential misuse, Varonis enables privacy-by-design on data stores containing sensitive and regulated information.
Fulfill Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs) and Protect Consumer Data. Our solutions help fulfill data subject access requests from file systems on-premises and in the cloud. Customers can easily find relevant files, pinpoint who has access and enforce policies to move and quarantine regulated data.
Our Growth Strategy 

Our objective is to be the primary vendor to which enterprises turn to protect their data. The following are key elements of our growth strategy.
Extend Our Technological Capabilities Through Innovation and Strategic Transactions. We intend to increase, in absolute dollars, our current level of investment in product development in order to enhance existing products to address new use cases and continue to deliver new products. We believe that the flexibility, sophistication and broad applicability of our platform will allow us to use this framework as the core of numerous future products built on our same core technology. Our ability to leverage our research and development resources has enabled us to create a new product development engine that we believe can proactively identify and solve enterprise needs and help us further penetrate and grow our addressable markets. Additionally, we recently introduced new licenses into our platform to cover additional cloud applications and infrastructure that were further developed by us after acquiring a provider of software that maps and analyzes relationships between users and data across a number of cloud applications and services. We will continue to seek additional opportunities to extend our technological capabilities and grow our business, from continued organic investments in our research and development efforts to technological tuck-in acquisitions.

Grow Our Customer Base. The unabated rise in enterprise data, ubiquitous reliance on digital collaboration and increased cybersecurity concerns continue to drive demand for data protection, compliance and threat detection and response solutions. We intend to capitalize on this demand by targeting new customers, underpenetrated markets and use cases for our solutions. Our solutions address the needs of customers of all sizes, ranging from small and medium businesses to large multinational companies with hundreds of thousands of employees and petabytes of data. Although our solutions are applicable to organizations of all sizes, we will continue our focus on targeting larger organizations who can make larger purchases with us initially and over time.

Increase Sales to Existing Customers. We believe significant opportunities exist to further expand relationships with existing customers. Data growth and related security concerns continue across all data stores, and enterprises want to standardize solutions that help them manage, protect and extract more value from their data, wherever it is stored. We expect to continue to drive incremental sales from our existing customers through the increased use of our software within our installed base by expanding footprint and usage. The Varonis Data Security Platform currently has over thirty-five licenses. As of December 31, 2021, 73% of our customers with 500 employees or more had purchased four or more licenses and 41% purchased six or more licenses. We believe our existing customer base serves as a strong source of incremental revenues given our broad platform of products, their growing volume and complexity of enterprise data and the associated security concerns. As we continue to innovate and expand our product offering, we expect to have an even broader suite of products to offer our customers. Our perpetual license maintenance renewal rate ("maintenance renewal rate") for the year ended December 31, 2021 continued to be over 90%. Our key strategies to ensure a high renewal rate for our products include focusing on the quality and reliability of our customer service and support teams and providing software upgrades and enhancements when available.
Grow Sales from Our Newer Licenses and Functionality. We continue to introduce additional licenses and enhancements to existing products to support new functionalities and believe these can also be a meaningful contributor to our growth. These include: 
•In 2021, we introduced an update to our platform to help customers combat insider and collaboration risks related to Microsoft 365. The update increases insight into organization-wide exposures in Microsoft 365, adds new threat detection capabilities in Azure AD, adds support for additional Network Attached Storage ("NAS") solutions and versions, and enhances search granularity for locating sensitive and personal data. We also launched DatAdvantage Cloud, introducing licenses and support for additional cloud applications and infrastructure, including AWS, Box, GitHub, Google Drive, Jira, Okta, Salesforce, Slack and Zoom. DatAdvantage Cloud will help customers visualize and prioritize their biggest cloud risks, proactively reduce their blast radius, and conduct faster cross-cloud investigations. Additionally, we introduced Data Classification Cloud for Google Drive and Box to help automatically identify sensitive information in these mission-critical SaaS applications. While these products did not meaningfully contribute to our 2021 revenues, we believe they offer significant potential in extending the Varonis Data Security Platform to cloud applications where our customers continue to move sensitive data.
•In October 2020, we announced the acquisition of Polyrize Security Ltd. ("Polyrize"), whose technology led to the launch of the DatAdvantage Cloud and Data Classification Cloud licenses described above. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2020, we introduced a Remote Work Update to our platform to increase visibility into potential security issues related to remote work, including dashboards for unusual VPN, DNS and Web usage; comprehensive Microsoft Teams visibility; out-of-the-box reports for pinpointing exposed cloud data; and more threat models for Microsoft 365. 
•In 2019, we announced Version 7 of our Data Security Platform, which included new dashboards to assess compliance and Active Directory risk and GDPR security risks so that customers can more easily identify critical risk in their hybrid environments, including vulnerable user accounts, at-risk cloud data and potential compliance violations, as well as performance enhancements, such as the usage of SOLR, for faster, more scalable event retrieval and investigation. We also added classification functionality to help enterprises automatically discover and classify data that falls under data covered by the CCPA. We added threat intelligence to our security insights, built incident response playbooks directly into the User Interface ("UI") and made usability and performance improvements. 
•In 2018, we introduced Varonis Edge, which analyzes perimeter devices like DNS, VPN and web proxy to detect attacks like malware, APT intrusion and data exfiltration, and enable enterprises to correlate events and alerts to track potential data leaks and spot vulnerabilities at the point of entry. We also released Data Classification Labels, integrating with Microsoft Information Protection ("MIP") to help enterprises better classify, track and secure files across enterprise data stores and to address additional compliance requirements from new data privacy laws and standards. 

Expand Our Sales Force. Continuing to expand our sales force will be essential to achieving our customer base expansion goals. The sales force and our approach to introducing products to the market have been key to our successful growth in the past and will be central to our growth plan in the future. While our products serve customers of all sizes, in all industries and all geographies, the marketing focus and majority of our sales focus is on targeting organizations with 1,000 users or more who can make larger initial purchases with us and, over time, generate a greater potential lifetime value. Our customers span leading firms in the financial services, public, healthcare, industrial, insurance, energy and utilities, technology, consumer and retail, media and entertainment and education sectors. We also believe our existing customers represent significant future revenue opportunities for us. We believe that our sales model, which combines the leverage of a channel sales model with our highly trained and professional sales force to efficiently identify leads, perform risk assessments and convert them to satisfied customers, has and will continue to play a major role in our ability to grow and to successfully deliver our unique value proposition for enterprise data. We intend to expand our sales capacity by adding headcount throughout our sales and marketing department.

Establish Our Data Security Platform as the Industry Standard. We have worked with several of the leading providers of NAS and hybrid cloud storage, including Dell/EMC, IBM, NetApp, HP, Hitachi and Nasuni in order to expand our market reach and deliver enhanced functionality to our customers. We have worked with these vendors to assure compatibility with their product lines. Through the use of application programming interfaces ("APIs"), and other integration work, our solutions also integrate with many providers of solutions in the ecosystem. We will continue to pursue such collaborations wherever they advance our strategic goals, thereby expanding our reach and establishing our product user interface as the de facto industry standard when it comes to enterprise data.

Continue International Expansion. We believe there is a significant opportunity for our platform in international markets to address the need for data protection and threat detection and response. Revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa 
(“EMEA") accounted for approximately 26% and revenues from Rest of World (“ROW”) accounted for approximately 2% of our revenues, respectively, in 2021. We believe that international expansion will be a key component of our growth strategy, and we will continue to invest and market our products and services overseas.
Our Products

Our integrated platform of products currently contains more than 35 licenses. Each license utilizes our core technology to deliver features and functionality that allow enterprises to fully understand, secure and benefit from the value of their data. This architecture gives our clients the ability to select the features they require for their business needs and the flexibility to expand their usage simply by adding a license, and the fully-integrated nature of our products allows individual products to enhance the functionality of the others. At the same time, the ease of consumption under a subscription-based model has allowed us to deliver on customer demand for a greater number of our licenses, providing our customers more value quicker while leading to substantial future license upsell and cross-sell opportunities.

•DatAdvantage. DatAdvantage, our flagship product, launched in 2006, captures, aggregates, normalizes and analyzes every data access event for every user on Windows and UNIX/Linux servers, storage devices, email systems, Intranet servers, cloud applications and data stores, without requiring native operating system auditing functionalities or impacting performance or storage on file systems. Through an intuitive graphical interface, DatAdvantage presents insights from massive volumes of data using normal computing infrastructure. It is also our presentation layer for IT departments, which provides an interactive map of relevant users, groups and data objects, usage and content, facilitating analysis from multiple vectors. IT departments can pinpoint areas of interest starting with any metadata object, simulate changes measuring potential impact against historical access patterns, and easily execute changes on all data stores through a unified interface. DatAdvantage identifies where users have unnecessary access based on user behavior and machine learning. DatAdvantage currently contains 20 licenses, including:
◦Individual DatAdvantage licenses for on-premises data stores and infrastructure (Windows, Directory Services, SharePoint, Unix/Linux and Exchange) and cloud data stores and applications (OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, Azure Active Directory, Box, Google Drive, Salesforce.com, Slack, GitHub, Jira, AWS, S3, Zoom and Okta).
◦Automation Engine, introduced in 2017, which automatically repairs broken file systems and safely remediates exposures, helps customers accelerate the enforcement of a least privilege model by limiting broad access without substantial manual effort or resources. 
•DatAlert. Introduced in 2013, DatAlert profiles users and devices and their associated behaviors with respect to systems and data, detects and alerts on meaningful deviations that indicate compromise, provides a web-based dashboard and investigative interface and seamlessly integrates with security information and event management systems (SIEM). DatAlert helps enterprises quickly detect suspicious activity, prevents data breaches and cyberattacks, performs security forensics, visualizes risk and prioritizes and accelerates investigation. In addition, DatAlert contains Varonis Edge, which analyzes perimeter telemetry and enables enterprises to correlate events and alerts at the perimeter with alerts and events concerning data to better spot attacks at the point of entry and egress, reducing time to detection and time to resolution for security incidents. Lastly, with the addition of DatAdvantage Cloud, we are providing alerting capabilities for cloud applications and infrastructures.
•Data Classification Engine. As the volume of an enterprise’s information grows, enterprises struggle to find and tag different types of sensitive data, such as intellectual property, regulated content, including Personal Identifiable Information (“PII”), and medical records. Furthermore, content by itself does not provide adequate context to determine ownership, relevance, or protection requirements. Introduced in 2009, Data Classification Engine identifies and tags data based on criteria set in multiple metadata dimensions and provides business and IT personnel with actionable intelligence about this data, including a prioritized list of folders and files containing the most sensitive data and with the most inadequate permissions. For the identified folders and files, it also identifies who has access to that data, who is using it, who owns it, and recommendations for how to restrict access without disrupting workflow. Data Classification Engine provides visibility into the content of data across file systems and intranet sites and combines it with other metadata, including usage and accessibility. Data Classification Engine currently contains eight licenses, including:
◦Individual Data Classification Engine licenses for on-premises data stores and infrastructure (Windows/SharePoint and Unix) and cloud data stores (OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Google Drive and Box).
◦Data Classification Policy Pack, introduced as GDPR Patterns in 2017, builds upon the Data Classification Engine with over 400 patterns for identifying and classifying personal information specific to GDPR and CCPA.
◦Data Classification Labels, introduced in 2018, integrates with MIP to protect sensitive data across customer environments regardless of where it lives or how it is shared. Data Classification Labels allows users to automatically apply classification labels and encrypt files that it has identified as sensitive.
•DataPrivilege. Introduced in 2006, DataPrivilege was designed for use by business unit personnel and provides a self-service web portal that allows users to request access to data necessary for their business functions, and allows owners to grant access without IT intervention. DataPrivilege enhances data protection and compliance by enabling business users to make access decisions based on queries, user requests and metadata analytics information, rather than static IT policies. DataPrivilege provides a presentation layer for business users to review accessibility, sensitivity and usage of their data assets and grant and revoke access. We currently offer DataPrivilege licenses for Windows and SharePoint.
•Data Transport Engine. Introduced in 2012, Data Transport Engine provides an execution engine that unifies the manipulation of data and metadata, translating business decisions and instructions into technical commands such as data migration or archiving. Data Transport Engine allows both IT and business personnel to standardize and streamline activities for data management and retention, from day-to-day maintenance to complex data store and domain migrations and archiving. Data Transport Engine ensures that data migrations automatically synchronize source and destination data with incremental copying even if the source data is still in use, translates access permissions across data stores and domains and provides reporting capabilities for data migration status. Moreover, it also provides IT personnel the flexibility to schedule recurring migrations to automatically find and move certain types of data such as sensitive or stale data and to perform active migrations, dispositions and archiving safely and efficiently. We currently offer Data Transport Engine licenses for Windows and SharePoint.
•DatAnswers. DatAnswers was introduced in 2014 to provide secure, relevant and timely search functionality for enterprise data. In 2018, we enhanced DatAnswers to help meet growing demands to comply with data privacy regulations and eDiscovery requests, and to facilitate data subject access requests. As data privacy laws are becoming more prevalent across the globe, meeting subject access requests is a primary requirement in data regulation. Compliance officers, controllers, and administrators need to identify and locate relevant content related to a data subject, a task which is becoming increasingly harder to complete, due to the growth of data, where it’s stored and how it’s accessed. DatAnswers provides elevated search for compliance and e-discovery, helping solve the growing problem of being able to fulfill subject access requests to meet data privacy laws. We currently offer DatAnswers licenses for Windows, SharePoint, OneDrive and SharePoint Online.
Our Customers

We currently have customers in over 85 countries. Our customers span numerous industries and vary greatly in size, ranging from small and medium businesses to large multinational enterprises and government agencies. Our customers include leading firms in the financial services, public, healthcare, industrial, insurance, energy and utilities, technology, consumer and retail, media and entertainment and education sectors, with hundreds of thousands of employees and petabytes of data.
Services

Maintenance and Support of Subscription and Perpetual Licenses 

Maintenance and support associated with a subscription contract is included in the Subscriptions revenue line of the statement of operations. Maintenance and support associated with perpetual licenses is included in the Maintenance and services line of the statement of operations. These maintenance agreements provide customers the right to receive support and unspecified upgrades and enhancements when and if they become available during the maintenance period and access to our technical support services. 

We maintain a customer support organization that provides all levels of support to our customers. Our customers that purchase maintenance and support services receive guaranteed response times, direct telephonic support and access to online support portals. Our customer support organization has global capabilities with expertise in both our software and complex IT environments and associated third-party infrastructure.

Professional Services

While users can easily download, install and deploy our software on their own, certain enterprises use our professional service team to provide fee-based services, which include training our customers in the use of our products, providing advice on network design, product configuration and implementation, automating and customizing reports and tuning policies and configuration of our products for the particular characteristics of the customer’s environment. Although professional services have always been a small percentage of our total revenues, we have recently seen, and expect to continue to see, that percentage decline as many of our newer licenses can provide remediation in more automated ways.
Sales and Marketing

Sales

We sell the vast majority of our products and services to a global network of resellers and distributors that we refer to as our channel partners. Our channel partners, in turn, sell the products they purchase from us to customers. In addition, we maintain a highly trained professional sales force that is responsible for overall market development, including the management of the relationships with our channel partners and supporting channel partners in winning customers through operating demonstrations and risk assessments. Our channel partners identify potential sales targets, maintain relationships with customers and introduce new products to existing customers. Sales to our channel partners are generally subject to our standard, non-exclusive channel partner agreement. These agreements are generally for a term of one year with a one-year renewal term and can be terminated by us or the channel partner for any reason upon 30 days’ notice. A termination of the agreement has no effect on orders already placed. Payment to us from the channel partner is typically due within 30 to 60 calendar days of the invoice date.
Marketing

Our marketing strategy focuses on building our brand and product awareness, increasing customer adoption and demand, communicating advantages and business benefits as well as generating leads for our channel partners and sales force. We market our software as the Varonis Data Security Platform, a solution for securing and managing enterprise data. We execute our marketing strategy by leveraging a combination of internal marketing professionals, external marketing partners and a network of regional and global channel partners. Our marketing organization is responsible for branding, content generation, demand generation, field marketing and product marketing, and works with our business operations team to support channel marketing and sales support programs. We provide one-on-one and community education and awareness and promote the expanded use of our software. We host in-person or virtual Varonis Connect! customer events across sales regions, as well as free, online technical webinars in multiple regions. We focus our efforts on highly relevant content creation, events, campaigns and activities that can be leveraged by our channel partners worldwide to extend our marketing reach, such as information regarding product awards and technical certifications, security training, regional seminars and conferences, webinars, podcasts and various other demand-generation activities. Our marketing efforts also include public relations in multiple regions, industry analyst relations, customer marketing, account-based marketing, targeted advertising, extensive content development available through our website and content syndication, and our active blog.
Research and Development

Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on improving and enhancing our existing products, as well as developing new products, features and functionality. Use of our products has expanded from data governance into areas such as data security, threat detection and response, privacy, accessibility and retention, and we anticipate that customer demand and innovation will drive functionality into additional areas. We regularly release new versions of our products which incorporate new features and enhancements to existing ones. We conduct the majority of our research and development activities in Israel, and we believe this provides us with access to world-class engineering talent. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to extend our technological capabilities and grow our business from strategic technological tuck-in acquisitions.

Our research and development expense was $137.9 million, $99.4 million and $80.8 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Intellectual Property

We attempt to protect our technology and the related intellectual property under patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting our products. The nature and extent of legal protection of our intellectual property rights depends on, among other 
things, its type and the jurisdiction in which it arises. As of January 28, 2022, we had 79 issued patents and 15 pending patent applications in the United States. Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2025 and 2039. We also had 52 patents issued and 58 applications pending for examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and no pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) patent applications, all of which are counterparts of our U.S. patent applications. Certain of our patents are owned by our Israeli subsidiary. The claims for which we have sought patent protection relate primarily to inventions we have developed for incorporation into our products.

In addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology and trade secrets. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, service providers, vendors and customers and generally limit internal and external access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information and proprietary technology through certain procedural safeguards. We also rely on invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and others, to assign to the Company all inventions developed by such individuals in the course of their engagement with the Company.
Moreover, we have registered the “Varonis” name and logo and “DatAdvantage,” “DataPrivilege,” “DatAlert,” “DatAnywhere” and other names in the United States and, as related to some of these names, certain other countries. 
In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, we license software from third parties for integration into our solution, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, processes and services. While we have generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, such third parties may not continue to maintain such software or continue to make it available to us.

Competition

While there are some companies which offer certain features similar to those embedded in our solutions, as well as others with which we compete in certain use cases, we believe that we do not currently compete with a company that offers the same breadth of functionalities that we offer in a single integrated solution. Nevertheless, we do compete against a select group of software vendors that provide standalone solutions, similar to those found in our comprehensive software suite, in the specific markets in which we operate. We also face direct competition with respect to certain of our products, specifically Data Transport Engine, DatAnswers and DatAdvantage for Directory Services. As we continue to augment our functionality with insider threat detection and user behavior analytics and as we expand our classification capabilities to better serve compliance needs with new regulations, like GDPR, CCPA and other data privacy laws, and as these functionalities continue to be recognized as critical to protect enterprise data, we may face increased perceived and real competition from other security and classification technologies. In the future, as customer requirements evolve and new technologies are introduced, we may experience increased competition if established or emerging companies develop solutions that address the enterprise data market. Furthermore, because we operate in an evolving market, we anticipate that competition will increase based on customer demand for these types of products.

A number of factors influence our ability to compete in the markets in which we operate, including, without limitation: the continued reliability and effectiveness of our products’ functionalities; the breadth and completeness of our solutions’ features; the scalability of our solutions; and the ease of deployment and use of our products. We believe that we generally compete favorably in each of these categories. We also believe that we distinguish ourselves from others by delivering a single, integrated solution and sophisticated automation to address our customers’ needs regarding security access, governance, privacy and retention with respect to their enterprise data. However, we may not be able to remain unique in this capacity or continue to be able to compete favorably with other providers in the future.

If a more established company were to target our market, we may face significant competition. They may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, larger sales, marketing, research and acquisition resources, access to larger customer bases and channel partners, a longer operating history and lower labor and development costs, all of which may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do. Increased competition could result in us failing to attract customers or maintain renewals and licenses at the same rate. It could also lead to price cuts, alternative pricing structures or the introduction of products available for free or a nominal price, reduced gross margins, longer sales cycles and loss of market share.

In addition, our current or prospective channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with any future competitors. These relationships may allow future competitors to rapidly gain significant market share. These developments could also limit our ability to generate revenues from existing and new customers. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.

Employees and Human Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2021, we had 2,065 employees and independent contractors who developed, marketed, sold and supported our technology solutions, of which 911 were in the United States, 704 were in Israel and 450 were in other countries.
We understand that our innovation leadership is ultimately rooted in our people. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology space is intense, and our success depends in large part on our ability to recruit, develop and retain a productive and engaged workforce. Accordingly, investing in our employees and their well-being, offering competitive compensation and benefits, promoting diversity and inclusion, adopting progressive human capital management practices and community outreach constitute core elements of our corporate strategy.
•Offer Competitive Compensation and Benefits. We strive to ensure that our employees receive competitive and fair compensation and innovative benefit offerings, tying incentive compensation to both business and individual performance, offering competitive maternal and paternal leave policies, providing meaningful retirement and health benefits and maintaining an employee stock purchase plan. In 2021, all employees received a special allowance for home office equipment in order to allow them to continue effectively working remotely.
•Support Employee Well-being and Engagement. We support the overall well-being of our employees from a physical, emotional, financial and social perspective. We also regularly seek input from employees, including through broad employee satisfaction and pulse surveys on specific issues, intended to assess our degree of success in promoting an environment where employees are engaged, satisfied, productive and possess a strong understanding of our business goals. Our global well-being programs include a long-standing practice of remote working arrangements, flexible paid time off, life planning benefits, wellness platforms and employee assistance. In addition, we ensure ongoing check-ins with employees by HR and managers to provide additional channels of support.
•Promote Sense of Belonging through Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives. We conduct diversity and code of conduct trainings with employees and managers to share our views on the importance of diversity and the promotion of an inclusive and diverse workplace, where all individuals are respected and feel they belong regardless of their age, race, national origin, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity. We also require all employees to participate in unconscious bias training to improve awareness. We work with diversity focused candidate application platforms to increase access to diverse talent. Our customers are located in over 85 countries and our global workforce operates across cultures, functions, language barriers and time zones to provide them dedicated and ongoing support.
•Provide Programs for Employee Recognition. We offer rewards and recognition programs to our employees, including awards to recognize employees who best exemplify our values and spot awards to recognize employee contributions. We believe that these recognition programs help drive strong employee performance. We conduct semi-annual employee performance reviews, where each employee is evaluated by their personal manager and also conducts a self-assessment, a process which empowers our employees. Employee performance is assessed based on a variety of key performance metrics, including the achievement of objectives specific to the employee’s department or role. Employees have access to an internal platform to recognize their peers based on their professional and socially responsible contributions to the Company.
•Create Opportunities for Growth and Development. We focus on creating opportunities for employee growth, development, training and education, including opportunities to cultivate talent and identify candidates for new roles from within the company, as well as management and leadership development programs. Employee training and education includes online certification, in person certification and new hire training bootcamps. We also conduct manager training programs on an annual basis, which include in-depth managerial and coaching skills, as well as tailored feedback. We have established an internal mentoring program in which seasoned employees mentor new managers based on defined goals. 
•Promote Community Outreach and Support. We believe it is important to give back and promote community outreach and support through corporate giving and employee volunteerism in the communities in which we live and work. We also provide corporate matching of employee charitable donations and flexible volunteering during work time, letting our employees know that we support the charitable efforts that matter to them. 
Continued response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. We have prioritized the safety of our employees and business partners, continued to support the needs of our customers and communities, and continued to comply with state and local requirements, guidelines and recommendations. We operate in flexible and hybrid working arrangements, using digital platforms and virtual collaboration tools to maintain productivity and to remain in contact with one another and our business partners and customers. We continue to enhance and promote programs to support our employees' mental and physical well-being.
