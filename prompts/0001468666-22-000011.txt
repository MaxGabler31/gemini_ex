•online and face-to-face events, trade shows and industry events to create customer and prospect awareness; and
•sales tools and field marketing events to enable our sales organization to convert leads more effectively into customers.
Alliance Partnerships
We maintain alliance partnerships with key technology providers who deliver capabilities we see as valuable in keeping our customers secure. These partnerships involve technology licensing, joint technology development, integration, research cooperation, co-marketing and sell-through arrangements. We license the technologies under agreements that generally have terms ranging from one to five years, subject to renewal in most cases, either upon notice of renewal or upon failure by us or the provider to give notice of termination to the other party. The provider generally may terminate any license upon advance notice to us of between 90 and 270 days. The technology partner license agreements generally provide for post-termination support, transition and wind-down periods that are intended to limit any disruption to our business that could result from a license termination. We generally are required under the agreements to make licensing payments in the form of fees or royalties at a discount off the list price, although some agreements also include volume or tiered pricing.
Competition
The markets for our technology-driven security solutions and services are intensely competitive, and we expect competition to continue to increase in the future with the introduction of new security solutions, new technologies and new market entrants. Conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnerships, or acquisitions by our competitors. Changes in the threat and technology landscape have led to constantly evolving customer requirements for protection from security threats and adversaries.
We compete primarily against the following three types of security product and services providers, some of which operate principally in the large enterprise market and others in the market for small and medium-sized businesses:
▪security providers and niche IT security products and services such as CrowdStrike, Inc., Rapid7, Inc., SentinelOne, Inc. and Arctic Wolf;
▪diversified technology and telecommunications companies such as Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Microsoft, International Business Machines Corporation and AT&T Inc.; and
▪small regional managed security service providers, including new market entrants, that compete in the small and medium-sized businesses market.
As the extended detection and response market continues its rapid growth, it will continue to attract new market entrants as well as existing security vendors acquiring or bundling their products more effectively. 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include: 
▪global visibility into the threat landscape;
▪ability to generate actionable intelligence based on historical data and emerging threats;
▪speed of innovation;
▪scalability and overall performance of platform technologies;
▪deep understanding of security operations best practices;
▪ability of our technology to integrate with a variety of third-party products;
▪ability to deliver SaaS solutions to meet specific customer needs;
▪ability to attract and retain high-quality professional staff with information security expertise;
▪brand awareness and reputation;
▪strength of sales and marketing efforts;
▪cost effectiveness;
▪customer success and support; and
▪breadth and richness of threat intelligence, including history of data collection and diversity and geographic scope of customers.
We believe that we generally compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors as a result of the features and performance of our portfolio, the quality of our threat intelligence, the security expertise within our organization and the ease of integration of our solutions with other technology infrastructures. However, many of our competitors, particularly in the large enterprise market, have advantages over us because of their greater brand name recognition, larger customer bases, more extensive relationships within large commercial enterprises, more mature intellectual property portfolios and greater financial and technical resources.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is an essential element of our business. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as confidentiality, employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements.
Our employees and contractors involved in technology development are required to sign agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, processes and other intellectual property rights conceived or reduced to practice by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any ownership that they may claim in those intellectual property rights. We maintain internal policies regarding confidentiality and disclosure. Our customer and resale contracts prohibit reverse engineering, decompiling and other similar uses of our technologies and require that our technologies 
be returned to us upon termination of the contract. We also require our vendors and other third parties who have access to our confidential information or proprietary technology to enter into confidentiality agreements with us.
Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use, without our consent, intellectual property that we own or otherwise have the right to use. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses we incur in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, which leads to frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, large and established companies in the IT security industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation. From time to time, third parties, including some of these large companies as well as non-practicing entities, may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners or our end-customers, which we are obligated to indemnify against such claims under our standard license and other agreements. Successful claims of infringement by a third party, if any, could prevent us from performing certain solutions, require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing solutions, or force us to pay substantial damages (including, in the United States, treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents), royalties or other fees.
Patents and Patent Applications
As of January 28, 2022, we owned 49 issued patents and 13 pending patent applications in the United States and four issued patents and seven pending patent applications outside the United States. The issued patents are currently expected to expire between 2023 and 2040. Although we believe that our patents as a whole are important to our business, we are not substantially dependent on any single patent.
We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to modify or narrow our claims, as has happened in the past with respect to certain claims. Any patents that may be issued to us may not provide us with any meaningful protection or competitive advantages, or may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon them. 
Trademarks and Copyrights
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted us federal registrations for some of our trademarks. Federal registration of trademarks is effective for as long as we continue to use the trademarks and maintain our registrations as permitted under federal law. We also have obtained protection for some of our trademarks, and have pending applications for trademark protection, in the European Community and various countries. We may, however, be unable to obtain trademark protection for our technologies and names that we use, and names, slogans or logos that we use or may use may be deemed non-distinctive, and therefore unable to distinguish our solutions from those of our competitors in one or more countries.
We have entered into a trademark license agreement with Dell Inc. under which Dell Inc. has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free worldwide license to use the trademark “DELL,” solely in the form of “SECUREWORKS-A DELL COMPANY,” in connection with our business and products, services and advertising and marketing materials related to our business. 
Backlog
We define backlog as the non-cancellable value of subscription-based solutions to be provided under Taegis solutions and managed security services contracted with a customer that have not yet been provisioned or installed. Backlog is not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements until we establish a contractual right to invoice, at which point backlog is recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, as appropriate. All contractual amounts included in backlog are available to be installed and revenue recognition commenced within the coming fiscal year. As of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, backlog of subscription-based solutions was approximately $2.6 million and $7.7 million, respectively. Backlog is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals and the mix of solutions under contract with customers. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not always a reliable indicator of future revenues.
Seasonality
Given the annual budget approval process of many of our customers, we have begun to see seasonal patterns in our business. Seasonal variations in our financial results may become more pronounced in future periods, with sales to new customers and additional sales to existing customers being greater in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, as compared to the first half of the year. In addition, we also experience seasonality in our gross and operating margins, with lower margins in the first half of our fiscal year as a result of greater expenditures for payroll taxes and annual sales and marketing events. This seasonality may also affect the timing of our operating cash flow.
Human Capital Resources
Employee Population
As of January 28, 2022, we employed 2,351 full-time employees. Approximately 54.1 percent of our employees were located in the United States and the remainder were located in 24 other countries. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor organization or the subject of a collective-bargaining agreement. Employees of some of our foreign subsidiaries are represented on workers’ councils.
Compensation, Benefits and Well-being
We are committed to providing employees with compensation and benefits that support their physical, mental and financial well-being. We believe our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives and assist in the achievement of our strategic goals. In addition to competitive base salaries, eligible employees can receive short-term incentives and long-term cash or equity awards. We also offer employees a wide array of benefits, including life and health and welfare insurance, retirement benefits, and paid time off.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted a mandatory work-from-home policy for almost all but a small number of onsite essential personnel, and we restricted travel to essential “business-critical” needs. With the support and commitment of our employees, we were able to seamlessly pivot to a work-from-home model and continue protecting our customers without interruption. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, our Chief Executive Officer hosted weekly all-hands update calls, and we believe open and on-going communications have been critical to maintaining our culture and productivity during the pandemic. During this period, we have taken a flexible approach to help our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a focus on employee well-being, health and safety.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that our future growth and innovation depend on a company culture that promotes diversity and inclusion, and we seek to advance these values in our hiring, development and advancement practices.
We also seek to connect our employees across regions and provide them with opportunities to enhance cultural awareness and enable collaboration.
Communication and Engagement 
We believe that our corporate culture depends on our employees’ engagement and understanding of their contribution to the achievement of our strategic imperatives, vision and mission. In addition to prioritizing regular communications, we conduct regular employee surveys to seek feedback on what is going well and where we can focus our efforts to do more. We also have active employee resource groups, which are designed to address the need for more social and community interaction in our globally diverse workforce.
Community Involvement
We aim to give back to the communities where we live and work and believe that this commitment helps in our efforts to attract and retain employees. We partner with a variety of universities and inclusion-focused programs in the United States and abroad to promote STEM education for all. Beyond contributions of cash, we encourage employees to participate in numerous local events and provide volunteer service throughout the year.

As of the last day of fiscal 2022, we ceased to be an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012. As an emerging growth company, we were exempted by SEC rules from certain disclosure requirements that otherwise are applicable to companies that file periodic reports with the SEC. As a result of our change in reporting status, we now provide the same level of information as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies or otherwise subject to scaled reporting under SEC rules.
