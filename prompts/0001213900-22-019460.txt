Business Overview



Veritas Farms, Inc. is a vertically-integrated agribusiness focused on growing, producing, marketing, and distributing superior quality, whole plant, full spectrum hemp oils and extracts containing naturally occurring phytocannabinoids (collectively, “CBD”). Veritas Farms™ owns and operates a 140 acre farm in Pueblo, Colorado, capable of producing over 200,000 proprietary full spectrum hemp plants which can potentially yield a minimum annual harvest of 250,000 to 300,000 pounds of outdoor-grown industrial hemp. While part of the cannabis family, hemp, which contains less than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”), the psychoactive compound that produces the “high” in marijuana, is distinguished from marijuana by its use, physical appearance and lower THC concentration (marijuana generally has a THC level of 10% or more). The Company also operates approximately 15,000 square feet of climate-controlled greenhouses to produce a consistent supply of year-round indoor-cultivated hemp. In addition, there is a 10,000 square foot onsite facility used for processing raw hemp, oil extraction, formulation laboratories and quality/purity testing. Veritas Farms is registered with the Colorado Department of Agriculture to grow industrial hemp and with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to process hemp and manufacture hemp products in accordance with Colorado’s hemp program. The Company primarily conducts its business operations through its wholly-owned subsidiary, 271 Lake Davis Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“271 Lake Davis”).



Veritas Farms meticulously processes its hemp crop to produce superior quality whole-plant hemp oil, extracts and derivatives which contain the entire full spectrum of cannabinoids extracted from the flowers and leaves of hemp plants. Veritas Farms employs the use of the cold ethanol extraction method to extract the whole plant hemp oil from its hemp crop. Whole-plant hemp oil is known to provide the essential phytocannabinoid “entourage effect” resulting from the synergistic absorption of the entire full spectrum of unique hemp cannabinoids by the receptors of the human endocannabinoid system. As a result, Veritas Farms believes that its products are premier quality cannabinoids and are highly sought after by consumers and manufacturers of premium hemp products.



Veritas Farms has developed a wide variety of formulated phytocannabinoid-rich hemp products containing naturally occurring phytocannabinoids which are marketed and distributed by the Company under its Veritas Farms brand name. Our products are also available in bulk, white label and private label custom formulations for distributors and retailers. These types of products are in high demand by health food markets, wellness centers, pet suppliers, physicians and other healthcare practitioners.



Veritas Farms products (50+ SKUs) include capsules, gummies, tinctures, lotions, salves, creams, balm sticks, lip balms and pet chews. All product applications come in various flavors and strength formulations, in addition to bulk volume sales. Many of the Company’s whole-plant hemp oil products and formulations are available for purchase online directly from the Company through its Veritas Farms website, www.theVeritasFarms.com, as well as through numerous other online retailers and “brick and mortar” retail outlets.



The branding of the Company’s line of hemp oil and extract products has enabled market penetration during 2020 and 2021 into large retail chains vastly increasing brand exposure and awareness. The initial rollouts have been successful in creating distribution opportunities into thousands of new retail outlets across the country (over 8,000 retail outlets as of the date of this report). The shift from smaller order fulfilment to larger “Big Box” orders creates an economy of scale that offers the opportunity for the Company to achieve profitability.

Effects of the Current Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic on the Company



The adverse public health developments and economic effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, could adversely affect the Company’s customers and suppliers as a result of quarantines, facility closures, closing of “brick and mortar” retail outlets and logistics restrictions imposed or which otherwise occur in connection with the pandemic. More broadly, the high degree unemployment resulting from the pandemic could potentially lead to an extended economic downturn, which would likely decrease spending, adversely affect demand for our products and services and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. The rapidly changing global market and economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively impacted, and are expected to continue to negatively impact, our operations and business. The broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic unpredictability on our business, financial condition, and results of operations remain uncertain. At this time, we cannot accurately predict the effect the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company.

Why Cannabinoids? 



Cannabinoid-rich hemp oil is made from the stalks and leaves of the cannabis sativa plant. Like THC, cannabinoid-rich hemp is an active cannabinoid found in cannabis plants. Unlike THC, however, cannabinoid-rich hemp has no psychoactive properties and its health benefits may be even more profound than those of THC.



What are cannabinoids? They are chemical compounds secreted by the flowers of the cannabis plant. Our brains have receptors that respond pharmacologically to them. THC is the psychoactive cannabinoid, which binds to receptors in the brain, while cannabinoid-rich hemp binds to receptors throughout the body. Whole-plant hemp extracts are known to provide the essential phytocannabinoid “entourage effect” resulting from the synergistic absorption of the entire broad spectrum of unique hemp cannabinoids by the receptors of the human endocannabinoid system.



Through our body’s endocannabinoid receptors, cannabinoid-rich hemp oil can mitigate both pain, swelling and inflammation associated with it. Science has long known about cannabinoid’s analgesic properties, which is why we now have a number of cannabinoid-rich hemp-infused topical creams and salves designed for direct application to skin.



There seems to be no end to the painful conditions for which cannabinoid-rich hemp oil could mean a measure of localized relief. Enthusiasts commonly cite arthritis, menstrual cramps, headaches, and even plain old muscle soreness or the itchiness from psoriasis and dermatitis as potential targets for the cannabis compound.




Current Industry Factors and Market Opportunity



Typical Cannabinoid Company Profile. The majority of cannabinoid companies are either farmers/extractors, manufacturers, or retail brands. Farmers often grow and extract their oil, sometimes selling their oil wholesale to product manufacturers and sometimes manufacturing their own products and then selling them in bulk to brands that use them for private label products. Retail brands are forced into a state of constant supply search and often have to order from multiple farmers/extractors in order to ensure their demand is met. This can cause inconsistency in product potency and quality, often leading to products that do not have an accurate Certificate of Analysis or additional contaminate tests.
Poor Quality Products, Morally Questionable Companies. As with any burgeoning new market, opportunistic entrepreneurs and entities have surfaced selling inferior products that are often misrepresented and mislabeled. These products may contain little to no active cannabinoid compounds, or contaminated cannabinoid compounds. These entities often seek a quick payday for the company’s founders and take advantage of the lack of consumer education about the industry.



Lack of Consumer Knowledge/Confusion in Market Place. New markets and products are often rife with miseducation and misunderstanding. Cannabinoid products are just beginning to be absorbed by the mainstream public, who may be unaware of the implications of the lack of quality control, proper application, dosing and uses.



The industrial hemp market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 34% from $4.6 billion in 2019 to $26.6 billion by 2025. The growth of this market is attributed to the increased consumption of hemp-based products. Our goal is to secure as large a share of the growing market for CBD products as possible, by taking advantage of the fractured nature of the industry, the poor quality products offered by some competitors and the lack of knowledge of the potential benefits of CBD by means of:




● | Offering only the highest quality products by maintaining control of the growing, extracting and manufacturing processes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Providing a one-stop vertically integrated source for CBD products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing demand by educating consumers on the potential benefits of use of CBD products; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Employing an integrated marketing plan across both traditional and digital channels.

Adoption of a Functional Product Line



Since inception, Veritas Farms has offered a variety of full-spectrum hemp oil products designed to improve the general health and wellness of our consumers. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and evolving needs of our consumers, Veritas will be launching a new purpose-built product line in the second quarter of 2022 designed to target a wider variety of common health conditions, supported with additional dietary supplements.




According to data insights from New Frontier Data, 82% of consumers that purchase CBD products do so for a specific need. Only 18% of consumers purchase CBD for general health and wellness. By modifying the cannabinoid potency levels (CBD, CBG, CBN, etc.) and adding in additional natural botanicals and adaptogens that have a proven benefit for certain health conditions, Veritas has been able to scientifically design a functional line of products that is specific to the needs of consumers. The new line consists of six products including Sleep Support, Stress Relief, Muscle & Joint Relief, Immunity Boost, Heart Health, and Energy Boost.

Production



Hemp growth, extraction, processing, formulation and product manufacturing takes place at our facilities located on our 140-acre farm in Pueblo Colorado. Our farm is capable of producing over 200,000 plants potentially yielding a minimum annual harvest of 250,000 to 300,000 pounds of outdoor grown hemp.



In addition, the Company’s 15,000 square feet of climate-controlled greenhouses are capable of producing a consistent supply of approximately 25,000 pounds per year of indoor cultivated hemp over 4-6 individual harvests.



There is an additional 10,000 square foot on-site facility used for plant processing and oil extraction, in addition to housing Veritas Farms’ testing and formulation laboratories, wherein GMP (good manufacturing practices) are strictly maintained.



The production process starts in the ground, with our cultivation team. Veritas Farms is fortunate to have a team of dedicated, experienced, and passionate farming experts that nurture our plants with individual care, much like the care and attention paid to vines in a vineyard.



After harvest, our in-house laboratory chemists and extraction technicians produce varieties of high quality, pure hemp derivative oils while constantly finding methods to improve processes and improve our products.



Veritas Farms uses advanced, strict natural protocols to cultivate its cannabinoid-rich hemp oil yield from its plants. After naturally air drying, only the leaves and flowers richly coated with trichomes are processed with our advanced ethanol spray evaporation extractors according to the planned uses for the cannabinoid-rich hemp extracts. Whole-plant full spectrum cannabinoid-rich hemp extracts are then further processed using chromatography and other techniques yielding pure distillates and other derivatives exceeding 80% cannabinoid-rich hemp with 0.3% or less THC.

Currently, Veritas Farms has implemented a marketing plan to compete in the cannabinoid industry. To become a market leader in the industry, the Company plans to use three primary channels to market its products, web-based marketing, traditional marketing and medical marketing.




Web-Based Marketing



General. Veritas Farms’ expanded e-commerce retail platform is designed to offer for sale the Company’s premium phytocannabinoid-rich extract products directly to consumers under the Veritas Farms brand. The site gives us the ability to quickly adapt to a rapidly evolving market and to position our branded product lines as a leader in the industry. In addition to our e-commerce platform, Veritas Farms is pursuing distribution with leading third-party online retailers.
Content Marketing via Blogs and Social Media. We believe that content marketing offers a cost-effective marketing strategy. The core components to Veritas Farms’ content marketing strategy are blogs and social media posts. Veritas Farms launched an engaging social media campaign to promote an overall vision of quality and transparent phytocannabinoid products.
Influencer Campaigns. Influencer marketing is a type of marketing that focuses on using online leaders to drive the brand’s message to the larger market. Rather than market directly to a large group of consumers, Veritas Farms will partner with influencers to utilize their personal social channels to spread the word about the brand. Influencers are celebrities, high-quality content creators, buzz builders and promoters and natural health advocates. Extensive tracking methods will be implemented to determine the effectiveness of the influencer campaigns.
Affiliate Marketing, Affiliate marketing leverages partners or affiliates that earn a commission for marketing our products. The affiliates are allowed to pick which products they enjoy selling the most, preferably products they use and find effective, then promote that product to their followers and earn a piece of the profit. The sales are tracked via affiliate links from their website to ours.
Search Engine Optimization, (“SEO”). SEO is important for establishing and creating an online presence. Most online interaction starts with key words manually entered into a search engine, in relevant website options for the user. The Veritas Farms SEO marketing plan contemplates a monthly campaign to ensure the website ranks in top relevance for industry-related searches on major search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo.
Intellectual Property



We do not currently have any patents or copyrights. We currently own trademark registrations for the marks “VERITAS FARMS”, and “Veritas | Farms”, and a pending trademark application for the mark “VERITAS FARMS V BE TRULY HEALTHY”.



We rely on a combination of trade secret, including federal, state and common law rights in the United States, nondisclosure agreements, and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We require our employees, consultants, and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements and to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived under their respective employment, consultant, or advisor agreement, using our property, or which relate to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Our business is affected by our ability to protect against misappropriation and infringement of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, domain names, and other proprietary rights.

Government Regulation



We operate our business in markets that are both highly regulated and rapidly evolving. We are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations affecting our operations in a number of areas. These laws and regulations affect the Company’s activities in areas including, but not limited to, the hemp business in the United States, the consumer products and nutritional supplement markets in the United States, consumer protection, labor, intellectual property ownership and infringement, interstate commerce and taxation, federal and state healthcare, environmental and safety. The successful execution of our business objectives will be contingent upon our compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals, permits and registrations, which may be onerous and expensive.



The federal Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (“Farm Bill”), signed into law on December 20, 2019, along with the Agricultural Act of 2014, the corresponding Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 provisions (as extended by resolution into 2019) and Colorado’s Industrial Hemp Regulatory Program and related state law, permit the cultivation of hemp, and the processing and manufacturing of hemp products, as part of agricultural pilot programs and/or state plans adopted by individual states, including Colorado (pursuant to which we operate). However, there can be no assurance that new legislation or regulations may be introduced at either the federal and/or state level which, if passed, would impose new regulatory requirements on the manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution and sale of hemp-derived products. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation, elimination or relabeling of certain products to meet new standards and revisions to certain sales and marketing materials and it is possible that the costs of complying with these new regulatory requirements could be material.




The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and their state-level equivalents, possess broad authority to enforce the provisions of federal and state law, respectively, applicable to consumer products. These regulations provide consumer safeguards for foods, dietary supplements and cosmetics, and give the power to these agencies to issue a public warning or notice of violation letter to a company, publicize information about illegal products, detain illegal products intended for import or export (in conjunction with U.S. Customs and Boarder Protection), require a recall of illegal products from the market, and request the Department of Justice, or the state-level equivalent, to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action, or a criminal prosecution in federal. or state courts. The initiation of any regulatory action towards industrial hemp or hemp derivatives by the FDA, FTC or any other related federal or state agency, could result in greater legal cost to Veritas Farms, may result in substantial financial penalties and enjoinment from certain business-related activities, and if such actions were publicly reported, they may have a materially adverse effect on the Company, its business and its results of operations.



Competition



The industrial hemp cultivation and derivative products industry is relatively new and evolving. Brand recognition, quality, performance, availability, and price are some of the factors that impact consumers’ choices among competing products and brands. Advertising, promotion, merchandising and the pace and timing of new product introductions also have a significant impact on consumers’ buying decisions. While we believe that the industry is fragmented at the present time, there is vigorous competition within each market where our products are sold, and there are numerous competitors, including Green Roads, Charlotte’s Web, cbdMD, Medterra and CV Sciences, some of whom are larger and have a longer operating history and greater financial resources than does the Company. Moreover, we may also face competition with larger firms in the consumer products manufacturing and distribution industry, who elect to enter the market given the relatively low barriers to entry. Veritas Farms believes that it competes effectively with these companies because of its vertical integration through the cultivation, extraction, formulation, manufacturing and distribution processes, the quality of its products and customer service. However, no assurance can be given that Veritas Farms will effectively compete with its existing or future competitors.

Human Capital Resources



We strive to create a high-performance culture that embraces diversity, inclusion, diverse perspectives and experiences, to ensure that employees have opportunities to develop the skills they need to grow and excel in their fields. Human capital management is a priority for our executives and board of directors. We are committed to identifying and developing the talent necessary for our long-term success. We have a robust talent and succession planning process and have established programs to support the development of our talent pipeline for critical roles in our organization. Annually, we conduct a robust review with the leadership team focusing on high performing and high potential talent, diverse talent and succession for our critical roles.



We also recognize that it is important to develop our future leaders. We provide a variety of resources to help our employees build and develop their skills, including online development resources as well as individual development opportunities and projects for key talent. Additionally, we have leadership development resources for our future leaders as they continue to develop their skills.



We also foster a strong corporate culture that promotes high standards of ethics and compliance for our business, including policies that set forth principles to guide employee, officer, director, and vendor conduct, such as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We also maintain a whistleblower policy and anonymous hotline for the confidential reporting of any suspected policy violations or unethical business conduct on the part of our employees, officers, directors, or vendors.



As of December 31, 2021 we employed 44 full time employees and consultants Company-wide including 20 of whom are based in Florida, Maryland and California and 24 of whom are based in Colorado. We believe that relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.



In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. These measures include allowing many employees to work from home and implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. We believe in supporting our employees’ health and well-being. Our goal is to help employees make informed decisions about their health by providing the tools and resources necessary to achieve a healthier lifestyle. We offer our employees a wide array of benefits such as life and health (medical, dental, and vision) insurance, and paid time off, as well as emotional well-being services through our health insurance program.



We offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they can focus on our mission. Our employees’ total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or sales commissions, and equity. We generally offer equity grants to certain full-time employees, primarily management, after their one-year anniversary of hire and through annual equity grants because we want them to be owners of the Company and committed to our long-term success. We have conducted an annual pay equity analysis, and continue to be committed to pay equity.

Our Background



Veritas Farms was incorporated as Armeau Brands Inc. in the State of Nevada on March 15, 2011. On October 13, 2017, the Company filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State changing the name from “Armeau Brands Inc.” to “SanSal Wellness Holdings, Inc.,” and on January 31, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State changing the name from “SanSal Wellness Holdings, Inc.” to “Veritas Farms, Inc.”



On September 27, 2017, the Company entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement with all the members of 271 Lake Davis, pursuant to which 271 Lake Davis became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “271 Lake Davis Holdings, LLC Acquisition”). 271 Lake Davis was founded in February 2015 to produce natural rich-hemp products.



On May 11, 2021, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with the Cornelis F. Wit Revocable Living Trust, of which Cornelis F. Wit is the trustee (“Wit Trust”), an existing shareholder, pursuant to which the Company contemporaneously sold to the Wit Trust an aggregate of (a) 2,000,000 shares of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Shares”); and (b) 1,000,000 shares of its Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred Shares,” and together with the Series A Preferred Shares, collectively, “Preferred Shares”) in exchange for (i) the payment of $2,000,000 (including $302,500 principal plus accrued but unpaid interest in bridge financing provided by the Wit Trust to the Company during April 2021); and (ii) the surrender of 2,000,000 units (“Units”), each Unit consisting of two shares of common stock and one warrant to purchase an additional share of common stock in accordance with the terms of the subscription agreements for the purchase of the Units entered into by the Wit Trust and the Company in September and October 2020. As a result of the transaction and the voting rights accorded the Preferred Shares, the Wit Trust then held approximately 88% of the voting power of the Company and accordingly, a “Change in Control” occurred.





Pursuant to the SPA, the Wit Trust and the Company agreed to fix the number of members of the board of directors of the Company at five (5), three of whom shall be designated by the Wit Trust and two of whom shall be “independent” and acceptable to the Wit Trust. In addition, the Wit Trust has been accorded certain registration rights under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), as amended, with respect to the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares and ongoing financial and other information rights with respect to the Company.




In connection with the consummation of the issuance and sale of the Preferred Shares to the Wit Trust pursuant to the SPA, Alexander M. Salgado stepped down as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and director, and Dr. Bao T. Doan and Marc J. Horowitz resigned as directors of the Company. In addition, Michael Pelletier stepped down as an employee of the Company and entered into a three-month consulting agreement with the Company to continue as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer until his successor is appointed.



Contemporaneously therewith, Stephen E. Johnson (“Mr. Johnson”), Kuno D. van der Post (“Dr. van der Post”) and Craig J. Fabel (“Mr. Fabel”) were elected and appointed as the Wit Trust’s designees on the board of directors. In addition, Mr. Johnson was appointed as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company, and Ramon A. Pino (“Mr. Pino”), was appointed as Executive Vice President of Finance, Treasurer and Secretary of the Company.
