Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
We develop hemp-derived, cannabidiol-based products, each formulated to address key segments of the health and wellness market. Through our subsidiaries and strategic partnerships, we sell high-end, full-spectrum oils, extracts, topicals, and pet products, all with the shared purpose of supporting the potential of relief of pain and inflammation for humans and pets through our e-commerce site www.cbdunlimited.com, as well as other online and in-store retailers. Our products are built upon three key fundamentals: targeted-delivery, controlled-dosing, and dual-therapy applications. Our products have been formulated with input from nutrition experts, cosmetic specialists, and Doctors of Podiatric Medicine; use American-sourced hemp-derived materials; and use the highest quality natural ingredients. Each product undergoes rigorous quality control checks to ensure that the final product is of the highest possible quality and is tested and verified by independent laboratories. (See, “Government Regulation.”) We continue to invest in research and development in order to develop new products and delivery methods. We plan to scale our production to meet growing consumer demand by entering into new joint ventures and securing commitments from large retailers with national presence.
 
In addition to our consumer products, our Gorilla-Tek division offers a state-of-the art automated dispensing system providing a secure method of distributing hemp-based products. The proprietary system enables retailers to increase sales channels without opening a physical storefront location. Complementing our retail products and Gorilla-Tek divisions, we also own and operate a number of wholly-owned subsidiaries that offer technology and consulting solutions to the hemp and hemp-derived product industry, including an easy to use “Seed-to-Shelf” compliance and inventory tracking and process management system for regulated products in a front of counter pharmacy support platform.
 
We are led by a management team and advisory group that has decades of experience in the pharmacy, medical, hemp-derived products, nutraceutical, and health supplement industries. Our strategic partnerships include leading regulated hemp farms, manufacturers, marketers, and retailers with national presence, all supporting the development and sale of our hemp-derived products. We are based in Cave Creek, Arizona.
 
Historical Overview
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 5, 1997 as Micron Solutions, Inc. (“Micron Solutions”), in order to complete a merger with Shillelagh Ventures Chartered, a Utah corporation (“Shillelagh”). In November 1997, Shillelagh merged with and into Micron Solutions, with Micron Solutions as the surviving entity.
 
In 2002, Micron Solutions entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with PanaMed, Inc., a California corporation, formerly known as PanaMed Africa, Inc., and all of its shareholders, pursuant to which they transferred and assigned their common shares to Micron Solutions in exchange for an equal number of shares of common stock of Micron Solutions, thereby causing PanaMed, Inc. to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Micron Solutions. In connection with the Exchange Agreement, Micron Solutions (i) changed its name to PanaMed Corporation (“PanaMed Corporation”), (ii) effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, such that every ten shares of PanaMed Corporation’s common stock became one share of its common stock, and (iii) amended its Articles of Incorporation similarly to decrease the number of its authorized shares of capital stock by the same ratio as the reverse stock split ratio. From 2002 to 2005, PanaMed Corporation operated as a biotech service and licensing company, investing capital into biotechnologies and conducting therapeutic treatment programs in the Ivory Coast, Africa.
 
In June 2005, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to change our name to Endexx Corporation. At that time, we adopted our current trading symbol, “EDXC.” In September 2005, we acquired Visual Board Books, Inc. (“VBB”), a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) developer, through a merger, whereby VBB merged with and into us, and we were the surviving entity. Subsequently, we operated as a diversified technology and SaaS and compliance and tracking systems company until we shifted our focus to the hemp-derived product industry in August 2014. In October 2018, we changed our name to CBD Unlimited, Inc., and in May 2020, we changed our name back to Endexx Corporation, with CBD Unlimited, Inc., becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary. On January 25, 2021, we filed our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation.
 
Operating Subsidiaries
 
We currently have two primary operating subsidiaries:
 
Go Green Global Enterprises, Inc.
 
We acquired Go Green Global Enterprises, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Go Green Global”), pursuant to a Common Stock Share Exchange Agreement (the “GG Share Exchange Agreement”), dated May 1, 2018, with Go Green Global, as subsequently amended by the First Amended Common Stock Share Exchange Agreement, dated July 10, 2018 (the “Amendment”; and, together with the GG Share Exchange Agreement, the “Amended Exchange Agreement”). Pursuant to the Amended Exchange Agreement, we issued 10,000,000 restricted shares of our Common Stock to the two former equity owners of Go Green Global in exchange for 20,000,000 restricted shares of Go Green Global’s common stock, which constituted all of its post-closing issued and outstanding shares of common stock, and resulted in Go Green Global becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary. The GG Share Exchange Agreement was the first step in our proposed entry into the Jamaican cannabis market.
 
In June 2018, Go Green Global entered into an Agreement for the Assignment and Assumption of Contracts, Intellectual Property, Trade Secrets, and Business Opportunities (the “Go Green Global and Jamaica Assignment”) with Go Green Global Enterprises Limited, a Jamaican corporation (“Go Green Jamaica”), in furtherance of Go Green Global’s business strategy to commence operations in Jamaica. As a result of the Go Green Global and Jamaica Assignment, Go Green Global now owns 49% of the ordinary shares of Go Green Jamaica. The remaining 51% of the ordinary shares are held by Go Green Jamaica’s legacy equity owners (including one of its directors, Kent Gammon), each of whom is otherwise unaffiliated with the Company. Our Chief Executive Officer, Todd Davis, serves as one of the three directors of Go Green Jamaica and as its President.

Pursuant to the Go Green Global and Jamaica Assignment, Go Green Jamaica assigned to Go Green Global certain assets, including (i) two consulting agreements, (ii) a lease for approximately 1,200 square feet of retail space to be operated as a “retail herb house” to be located in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, now that a “Retailer Licence” has been obtained from the Cannabis Licensing Authority of Jamaica (the “Jamaica CLA”), (iii) a lease for approximately one acre to be used to grow cannabis once the relevant license for growing operations has been obtained from the Jamaica CLA, and (iv) license applications to grow, cultivate, process, package, and sell medical cannabis in Jamaica. As of June 17, 2021, Go Green Global has become licensed by the Jamaica CLA for retail sales and, prior to the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Jamaica CLA granted a provisional license for cultivation. We expect to commence retail operations on or about September 1, 2021. We expect that the cultivation license process will be completed in approximately six months, which will allow Go Green Jamaica then to commence its cultivation operations in Jamaica.
 
Together One Step Closer, LLC
 
We acquired Together One Step Closer, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company, doing business as Holistic Earth Remedies (“Holistic Earth Remedies”), pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Holistic SPA”), dated November 8, 2017, entered into between Holistic Earth Remedies and us. Pursuant to the Holistic SPA, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in Holistic Earth Remedies and, in consideration thereof, we issued 1,000,000 restricted shares of our Common Stock to its then-sole member, who was otherwise unaffiliated with us. Holistic Earth Remedies specializes in the formulation, production, and sales of a full line of topical lotions, gels, salves, balms, and spray applications for the potential natural relief of pain, inflammation, stress, and mild skin irritation. Holistic Earth Remedies currently has limited operations. It distributes third-party manufactured hemp-derived products that are sold at select health spas, fitness centers and alternative medicine outlets.
 
Additionally, we recently completed three acquisitions in connection with our business plan:
 
Kush Inc.
 
On February 1, 2020, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Kush Inc. (aka Kushwear; “Kush”), pursuant to which agreement we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Kush. In consideration thereof, at the closing of the transaction, we issued 500,000 restricted shares of our Common Stock to Charles Mohr, the sole shareholder of Kush, and are obligated to issue up to an additional 500,000 restricted shares of our Common Stock upon meeting certain milestones. One hundred twenty-five thousand of such additional restricted shares of our Common Stock will be issued upon the occurrence of each of the following events: (i) Kush clients generating $150,000 in gross sales revenue, (ii) 3,000 points of distribution being established, (iii) a positive return on investment being established in the first year of the agreement (which event did not occur), and (iv) the achievement of 200,000 “likes or engagements” (in any combination) in social media. We purchased Kushwear for rebranding purposes to reach a younger demographic with our clothing line and hemp-derived products. As of the date of this Amended Registration Statement, the website has been completed, but we have not launched our sales activities.
CBD Life Brands, Inc.
 
On March 1, 2020, we entered into a term sheet with CBD Life Brands, Inc. (“CBDLB”), for the purchase of all of CBDLB’s digital and social assets, intellectual property, and formulas/recipes for its cannabidiol (“CBD”)-infused beverages for which we paid $100,000. In connection with this transaction, the key employees of CBDLB agreed to enter into standard three-year non-competition agreements for our benefit. We are still in the process of developing CBD-infused beverage formulations, and expect to launch new products in late-2021.
 
Khode, LLC
 
On October 1, 2020, we entered into an LLC Operating Agreement of Khode, LLC (“Khode”) and, in May of 2021, we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement that resulted in a minor adjustment to the holdings of the parties thereto. By virtue of that agreement, we now own 70.01% of the membership interests of Khode and, pursuant to the provisions of the Khode Operating Agreement, are required to make a capital contribution of $3,500,000. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have made a partial capital contribution in the amount of approximately $1,500,000 and expect to raise the balance through limited, private sales of our debt and equity securities. We cannot provide any assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, at times required by us, if at all. If we fail to make the entire capital contribution, we will be in breach of our obligations under the Khode Operating Agreement. In the event of such a breach, the 24.99% interest holder in Khode, a Florida corporation known as Serious Promotions, Inc., will have the right, exercisable by written notice given at any time on or before the date which is twenty Business Days following the occurrence of such event of default, to terminate the Endorsement Agreement (as described in the second paragraph, below), with Khode having a ten-month sell-off period with respect to all Branded Products (as defined in the Khode Operating Agreement) then manufactured but not yet sold.
 
Effective January 22, 2021, we entered into a Percentage Payment Agreement with a third party that is not otherwise affiliated with Khode, pursuant to which we are obligated to pay to that third party an amount equivalent to 2.1% of all cash received by Khode from its net sales of certain products during the term of that Percentage Payment Agreement, which will terminate when Khode has been dissolved. As of the date of this Amended Registration Statement, Khode has not generated any revenues and we cannot provide any assurance that it will generate any revenues.
 
During October 2020, Khode entered into a five-year Endorsement and License Agreement with Serious Promotions, Inc., a Florida corporation, f/s/o Khaled, professionally known as DJ Khaled, who is an American artist, record executive and producer, and media personality. Pursuant to that agreement, Khode is to create a custom line of hemp-derived-infused oils, creams, and other beauty products under DJ Khode’s brand and he is to promote the products through personal appearances, the use of social media platforms, participation in presentation videos, video, and audio “drops,” and media quotes. In connection with DJ Khaled’s services, Khode is obligated to make quarterly payments totaling an aggregate of $5,000,000 by July 1, 2025, of which aggregate amount, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Khode has tendered $750,000 and expects to finance the balance of the quarterly payments through cash flow from operations of Khode. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Khode has not generated any positive cash flow from operations and we cannot provide any assurance that it will generate any cash flow from operations in the future in an amount sufficient to, among other things, make such quarterly payments.

Present and Future State of Operations
 
Among our subsidiaries, acquisitions, and partnerships, CBD Unlimited, Inc., Phytobites Inc., Holistic Earth Remedies, Go Green Global Enterprises, and our operating agreement with Khode, LLC are operational and in full effect. Over the coming months and years, we intend to: (i) launch Go Green Global’s retail operation in Jamaica; (ii) re-brand Kushwear’s line-up of sustainable clothing and hemp-derived products; and (iii) develop CBDLB’s formula of hemp-derived and infused beverages, and integrate them into our product offering.
 
Overview of the Hemp-Derived Product Industry
 
The Difference Between Hemp and Marijuana
 
Both marijuana and hemp come from the same species of plant called “Cannabis.” Hemp is a unique strain or species known as “Cannabis Sativa L,” which, by dry weight, contains less than 0.3% THC concentration. Cannabis Sativa L plants contain unique compounds called cannabinoids and terpenoids. CBD is one of approximately 66 cannabinoids found in the Cannabis Sativa L plant and shares many properties with cannabis (i.e., marijuana). Unlike CBD derived from marijuana, CBD derived from the aerial parts of the hemp plant contains less than three-tenths of one percent (0.3%) of THC, the component that causes the psychoactive side-effects commonly associated with marijuana. In general, hemp CBD-based products that have a THC concentration of less than 0.3% is generally considered “legal” in the United States, and yields a product that some consumers believe contains the observed medicinal benefits of traditional cannabis, without inducing its “high” in consumers. Notwithstanding the beliefs of many consumers, the FDA has not recognized any medical benefits derived from CBD. CBD is available in several forms, such as isolates, distillates, and oil extracts, including (i) hemp seed oil, which has no CBD, (ii) full-spectrum CBD, which contains phyto-cannabinoids, such as THC, CBN, THCA, CBC, and CBG in variable concentrations, and is considered the most natural form of CBD, and (iii) broad-spectrum CBD, which contains less-to-non-detectable THC than full-spectrum CBD.
Market Opportunity
 
We believe that, with recent regulatory changes, the hemp-derived product industry is poised for growth. Recent projections from BDS Analytics Inc. and Arcview Market Research project that the collective market for hemp-derived product sales is poised to exceed $20 billion in the United States by 2024. This forecast takes into account products sold through licensed dispensaries, pharmaceuticals, and in the general retail market.
 
Many believe this current and prospective growth is driven by education and shifting attitudes towards hemp-derived Products. According to a January 2019 Consumer Reports survey, an estimated 64 million Americans have tried CBD in the preceding 24 months. A June 2019 Harris Poll reported that 86% of the survey takers had some awareness of CBD and 56% of the survey takers indicated that they support using CBD as a potential replacement for traditional pain killers. The June 2019 Harris Poll also indicated that CBD users tend to be younger, with over 10% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 44 years old using CBD regularly. Overall, males are more likely to have tried CBD and are more likely to use it regularly: 10% of males responded that they used CBD on a regular basis, as compared to just 4% of female respondents.
 
Our Products
 
The hemp-derived product industry is still largely underserved against the demand for natural and nutritional supplements and topicals. With the industry poised for growth in the coming years, our established portfolio of products and industry solutions can serve multiple market segments. Our current products and service offerings consist of two groups: (i) consumer products and (ii) technology solutions.
Our Current Consumer Products
 
Our focus is on the development, manufacture, and distribution of nutritional supplements and delivery systems for healthy living for the nutraceutical consumer market in the form of hemp-based, non-psychoactive cannabinoids and terpenoid extracts that are infused into products. Our current products encompass hemp-derived oils, topicals, extracts, drinks, premium chocolates, and a newly launched premium blue line of hemp-derived health and beauty care products. Our Phyto-bites are hemp-derived soft chews for animal use that are formulated to promote health and potentially support an improved quality of life.
 
According to the National Institutes of Health, a “dietary supplement” is a product that is intended to supplement the diet. A dietary supplement contains one or more dietary ingredients (including vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and other substances) or their components; is intended to be taken by mouth as a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid; and is identified on the front label of the product as being a dietary supplement. None of our products is a dietary supplement.
 
We have built a network of reliable suppliers of high-quality, hemp-derived products and provide pharmacy-grade delivery systems with consistent and precise dosages. The derived and finished products are tested at the point of origin and retested in the certified labs for contaminants, trace elements, potency, and purity. All products are developed and produced in ISO 9000 and GMP and OTC-certified facilities in collaboration with our distribution partners throughout the United States and established licensed medical hemp manufacturing and processing facilities.


We believe that our product line is establishing a new standard in quality, transparency, consistency, and accuracy. Using current extraction technologies and sustainable cultivation practices, our ultimate goal is to improve the safety, quality, and bioavailability of hemp-derived products to our customers. All of our products are sold on our e-commerce site, www.cbdunlimited.com, which seamlessly brings together our products, marketing content, and education into a single platform. The Premium Blue Line is marketed to the mass pharmacy, mass retail, and mass food markets.
 
Our existing consumer products include energy drinks, water products, tea bags, and K-Cup Pods and hemp-derived creams and mists.

Products Under Development and Implementation
 
Gorilla-Tek
 
We have developed and, subject to manufacturing, are implementing “Gorilla-Tek,” a secure automated inventory control and dispensing system developed for managing high value items. The technology has been re-engineered for the hemp-derived product and pharmacy industries and offers retailers a new venue for selling hemp-derived products in a safe and secure manner. The dispensing system is a kiosk that comes in multiple forms and is no larger than traditional vending machines. We also recently launched a propriety application as an “end cap” machine designed to service, educate, and advertise hemp-derived products as a self-contained full-service store within in a store. 
  
Gorilla-Tek was acquired in connection with our acquisition of Dispense Labs LLC in 2013 and uses proprietary software that is specifically designed to secure and control compliant transactions and manage inventory. We believe this will significantly improve profitability, accountability, security, and customer satisfaction. Gorilla-Tek is specifically designed and configured to dispense hemp-derived products, regulated products, and prescription refills, while also managing the supply chain, providing up-to-the-minute accounting details, and protecting the security of the product, as well as the consumer and/or patient accessing the system.   Gorilla-Tek has been tested in high-risk one in each of three geographically dispersed locations: Santa Ana, California; Denver, Colorado; and Kingston, Jamaica in licensed dispensaries. Originally known as “Autospense,” Gorilla-Tek was rebranded to reflect automated retail and remote retail applications better, where additional security, age compliance, and tracking are required. The Gorilla-Tek machines were strategically positioned at high-traffic areas in order to promote easy access and significant use. Initial results were promising, as retailers saw increased sales, reduced theft of products, and stronger inventory control. Subsequent to completion of testing, one of the machines is currently located at the manufacturing facility in California, the second is located at a retail establishment in Kingston, Jamaica, and the third is located at the retail facility in Kingston, Jamaica that we will operate now that we have received our license for retail sales from the Jamaica CLA. We expect to release Gorilla-Tek to the broader market in late-2021 and 2022, where we intend to partner with national retailers interested in selling hemp-derived products. 

Dudad
 
“Dudad” is an Acoustic Fingerprint Audio Ad Capture and advertising application platform. Development of the base operating system has been finalized. Additional investments will be required to commercialize the technology, and there can be no assurance that we will expend the resources necessary for commercialization, that we will have available resources, or that the technology can even be commercialized successfully. In order to commercialize Dudad, we will need to update the software app to current Python integration capabilities and then we will need to market it to the advertising industry. Python is an open-source programming language managed by the Python Software Foundation. WE believe that third-party programmers will be able to update the software for an expenditure of not more than $100,000. We do not currently know the economic extent of the marketing required for Dudad. When ready, as to which there can be no assurance, we expect to promote DuDad through advertisements in Advertising Age and other industry outlets.
Distribution Methods
 
All of our products are currently sold online through our e-commerce platform www.cbdunlimited.com, select distributors, specialty sales groups, and brick-and-mortar retailers.

We distribute our products throughout the United States, and now that the Cannabis Licensing Authority of Jamaica has granted Go Green Jamaica a “Retailer Licence,” we expect to commence the distribution of our products on a limited basis in Jamaica through Go Green Global and Go Green Jamaica commencing on or about September 1, 2021. Our product offerings to be sold in Jamaica through Go Green Global are expected to include medical cannabis products regulated by the Jamaica CLA, hemp-derived products, clothing, and other shop-related products. A portion of our sales comes through our e-commerce platform, and orders are fulfilled at our fulfillment center, which is located at our headquarters in Cave Creek, Arizona. Demand for our products is generally increasing and we are contemplating a transition of our distribution to a third-party fulfillment center.
 
In addition to our e-commerce website, several distributors carry our products and sell them into mass pharmacy, retail stores, food chains, convenience stores, gas station stores, and specialty shops. Our current retail strategy entails targeting accounts and regions throughout the United States where we believe our products, including our hemp-derived creams and mists, are most likely to succeed with retail shoppers. Our distribution and retail strategy aims to increase our brand exposure and drive follow-on purchases at retail locations that carry our products and through our e-commerce platform. We intend to utilize social media, print, radio, and digital marketing, as well as broad distribution agreements. We currently have distribution agreements with:
 

● | Southern Glazer’s Wine and Spirits, LLC: we entered into a 10-year (subject to successive automatic five-year renewals) Master Distribution Agreement, dated March 27, 2020, pursuant to which we appointed SGWS as our sole and exclusive distributor of certain of our products (as defined in the Agreement) to retail accounts that are licensed to sell alcoholic beverages in the territory (as defined in the Agreement), subject our rights to sell our products to end-users in the territory through electronic commerce. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Impulse Health LLC: we entered into a two-year (subject to successive automatic two-year renewals) Sales Representative Agreement, dated April 1, 2020, pursuant to which pursuant to which we appointed Impulse Health as our exclusive sales representative of certain of our products (as defined in the Agreement) to certain accounts (as defined in the Agreement). 
● | Beauty Strategy Group, LLC: we entered into a 12-month (subject to extension mutually agreeable to the parties) Brand Consulting Agreement, dated April 21, pursuant to which we granted Beauty Strategy the right to act as our consultant and the authorization to solicit orders from Ulta and Sephora in accordance with our regular terms of sale and prices then in effect. 

 
Effective on October 9, 2020, Khode entered into a Master Service Agreement with Impact Brokers, LLC, for a term that continues for the duration of the transactions contemplated by the Khode Operating Agreement. During the term of that agreement, Impact Brokers will provide to Khode strategic, creative, and operational support for those transactions.
 
The above summary description of each of the four agreements is not intended to be comprehensive. For a more complete understanding of each of the agreements, please see Exhibits 10.27, 10.28, 10.29, and 10.30 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
During our 2021 fiscal year, we did not have any significant customer concentrations; however, during our 2020 fiscal year, one of our customers accounted for 22% of our revenue.
 
Marketing
 
The key goal of our sales and marketing campaign is to provide broad exposure of our products and their demonstrated potential effectiveness to our target markets. We have adopted a multi-pronged approach to market our products and build brand awareness, encompassing digital, social, educational, and affiliate marketing:

● | Social Media Marketing: We are capitalizing on the reach of social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, to work with social media influencers to increase our brand awareness. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Digital Ads and Search Engine Optimization: We are developing personalized digital advertisements to target different consumer segments and explain the potential benefits of our products. Additionally, we intend to work with our partners and public relations team to optimize search engine results for our brand in the hemp-derived product category. We expect that our future marketing campaign will include: 
● | Affiliate Marketing: We are in the process of adopting an affiliate marketing campaign, where our sales teams and social media influencers will market and sell our products through their network of contacts and followers. We expect that our affiliate marketing campaign will offer commissions on sales and referrals that should enable the growth of our sales and brand awareness. 
● | Television and Radio Content: We intend to make regular appearances on radio stations and news segments to discuss our Company and its brands, and the hemp-derived product industry as a whole. 

Competition
 
The hemp-derived product industry is subject to significant competition and is comprised of thousands of businesses, ranging from growers, extractors, and manufacturers to distributors and retailers, and this number is expected to grow substantially in the coming years. We directly compete with small-to-mid-sized manufacturers with annual revenues between $2 million and $20 million. However, if we are successful in achieving our future growth targets, of which there can be no assurance, we would compete with much larger companies that generate annual revenues in excess of $50 million. Some of our key competitors include Alternate Health Corp., Charlotte’s Web Holdings, Inc., Cresco Labs, Inc., Curaleaf Holdings Inc., CV Sciences, Inc., Elixinol Global Ltd., Eviana Health Corp., KannaLife, Inc., Ovation Science Inc., and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
Competition against these brands is fierce, with each manufacturer offering a host of hemp-derived products directly competing with us. This can over-populate the market with indistinguishable products and brands, forcing customers to buy products with little information. With so many brands in the market, having a competitive differentiator is essential to attract customers. We believe our products are superior to those of many of our competitors because we have established formulations with controlled dosing and delivery systems, and have tested this platform within the healthcare industry with physicians, pharmacists, healthcare service providers, and veterinarians through clinical trials or other pharmacy collaborations. Additionally, we believe that providing good customer service to our customers, through transparency and education, will set us apart from our competitors. However, it is possible that one or more of our competitors could develop significant research or marketing advantages over us that allows them to provide superior products or pricing, respectively, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.

Suppliers
 
We have a network of suppliers and third-party service providers, including state-certified hemp suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors. We source all of our hemp from certified American growers, and manufacture all of our products in CGMP, OTC, Cosmetic, and ISO-certified facilities. Additionally, all of our ingredients and finished goods are tested for purity and quality by ISO-certified third-party laboratories: Delta Verde Laboratories, DB Labs, LLC, and a division of Eurofins Scientific SE. We make available to our customers copies of the laboratories’ certificates of analysis, which disclose THC concentration, presence of metals, pesticides, or any other harmful contaminants. We continuously manage the risks associated with third-party suppliers and service providers by continuously evaluating our supply chain for any quality or manufacturing problems, and are continually identifying alternative solutions to any potential issues.
Our Customers
 
We are not dependent on any single customer for a significant portion of our sales. However, we have customers who purchase our products on a regular basis. We believe this loyalty is an essential factor that will help differentiate our brand and products from our competition. Our goal is to continue to build this loyalty from our customers by offering the highest quality products and best customer service in the hemp-derived product industry.
 
In addition to the customers who visit our e-commerce platform, we have strong relationships with wholesalers, distributors, and retailers. Our products are now in approximately 6,400 retail locations  .
 
Government Regulation
 
In 2014, Congress enacted Section 7606 of the Agriculture Act of 2014 (the “2014 Farm Bill”), which provides for the domestic cultivation of industrial hemp as part of agricultural pilot programs adopted by individual states for the purposes of research by state departments of agriculture and institutions of higher education. The 2014 Farm Bill provides for the domestic cultivation of industrial hemp in these pilot programs, notwithstanding other federal laws, such as the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”). The 2014 Farm Bill governed any current domestic production of industrial hemp.
 
The 2014 Farm Bill’s provisions require states that choose to adopt agricultural pilot programs to study the growth, cultivation, or marketing of industrial hemp to do so in a manner that (i) ensures that only institutions of higher education and state agriculture departments are used to grow or cultivate industrial hemp; (ii) requires that sites used for growing or cultivating industrial hemp be certified with, and registered by, the states; and (iii) authorizes state agriculture departments to regulate the pilot programs. Within those parameters, the 2014 Farm Bill gives significant discretion to states to determine whether to adopt an industrial hemp pilot program, and to adopt regulations governing industrial hemp (including marketing research involving products derived from industrial hemp) under those pilot programs. Many of the states that have adopted pilot programs have registered private companies to participate in the pilot program. We worked with farms and extraction facilities that were registered under Arizona’s agricultural pilot program.
 
Under the 2014 Farm Bill, any cannabis plant, plant part, or plant product that contains a higher concentration of THC than permitted in industrial hemp is considered a Schedule I substance under the CSA and is not protected by the 2014 Farm Bill. In addition, any industrial hemp plant, plant part, or plant product that is produced outside of a state agricultural pilot program may be considered unlawful but not a controlled substance.
 
In December 2018, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the “2018 Farm Bill”) was signed into law. Prior to its passage, hemp, a member of the cannabis family, and hemp-derived products were classified as Schedule I controlled substances, and so were considered illegal under the CSA. With the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, hemp cultivation is broadly permitted outside of the state agricultural pilot programs. The 2018 Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law.
 
Additionally, there will be significant, shared state-federal regulatory power over hemp cultivation and production. Pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill, state agriculture departments must consult with the state’s governor and chief law enforcement officer to devise a plan that must be submitted to the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”). A state’s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once the Secretary of the USDA approves the state’s plan. In states opting not to devise a hemp regulatory program, the USDA will construct a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states must apply for licenses and comply with a federally-run program. This system of shared regulatory programming is similar to options states had in other policy areas, such as health insurance marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act, or workplace safety plans under the Occupational Health and Safety Act – both of which had federally-run systems for states opting not to set up their own systems. The USDA has deferred review and approval of state plans, establishing its umbrella plan for hemp production in states without approved plans, and issuing federal licenses to producers in such states until the agency promulgates final implementing regulations. Until such time as the USDA issues such final regulations, commercial hemp production under the 2018 Farm Bill cannot legally begin. However, research-related activities involving industrial hemp under the more-restrictive 2014 Farm Bill may continue. The USDA has expressed an intention to issue such final regulations in time for producers to cultivate hemp for commercial purposes during the 2020 growing season; however, the timing and content of the USDA’s final implementing regulations cannot be assured. Moreover, the 2018 Farm Bill permits states to establish additional restrictions on hemp production and hemp products than required under federal law, although states may not interfere with the interstate transportation of hemp or hemp products produced in compliance with the 2018 Farm Bill.
 
Even though the 2018 Farm Bill removed industrial hemp from the Schedule I list, the 2018 Farm Bill preserved the regulatory authority of the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) over cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds used in food and pharmaceutical products pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”) and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. The FDA has stated that it intends to treat products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds as it treats any other FDA-regulated products. The FDA requires a cannabis product (hemp-derived or otherwise) that is marketed with a claim of therapeutic benefit, or with any other disease claim, to be approved by the FDA for its intended use before it may be introduced into interstate commerce.

The FDA has also stated that it is unlawful under the FD&C Act to introduce food containing added CBD or THC into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. Even though products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds remain subject to the FDA’s regulatory authority, there are methods available for those companies who seek to lawfully introduce these products into interstate commerce. For example, a company can seek approval from the FDA to market a human or animal drug that is derived from cannabis with therapeutic claims. In June 2018, the FDA approved Epidiolex, which is a CBD-derived drug approved to treat epilepsy. The approval was based on adequate and well-controlled clinical studies, which gives prescribers confidence in the drug’s uniform strength and consistent delivery that support appropriate dosing needed for treating patients with epilepsy. The FDA’s position leaves a great deal of uncertainty in interpreting the legal standing of CBD – the 2018 Farm Bill legalizes the interstate commerce of hemp, but the FDA has made statements indicating its desire to regulate CBD products, which could significantly limit interstate commerce of CBD products.
 
Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulates advertising of all products, including for FDA-regulated articles made from hemp and CBD derived from hemp.
 
Accumulated Deficit
 
We have incurred operating losses since inception and have negative cash flow from operations. As of September 30, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $39,513,844 and incurred a net loss of $2,503,473 for the year then ended. Additionally, as of September 30, 2020 we had an accumulated deficit of $32,705,690 and incurred a net loss of $9,163,329 for our 2020 fiscal year.
 
As a result, our auditors have issued a going concern paragraph in their Audit Report dated September 30, 2022. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing until we can generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations. We intend to continue to seek additional debt or equity financing to continue our operations, but there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

We do not hold, nor have we applied for, any patents. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have one service mark for “Endexx.” Additionally, we have applied for several trademarks of our products’ names and logos, including “CBD Unlimited,” “Khode,” and “Phyto-Bites.” As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has not approved any CBD-related trademarks, and, accordingly, our applications are still pending.
