Item 1. Business.
Introduction
Acreage Holdings, Inc. (“Acreage”, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) is a vertically integrated, multi-state operator in the U.S. cannabis industry. Our operations include (i) cultivating and processing cannabis plants, (ii) manufacturing branded consumer products, (iii) distributing cannabis flower and manufactured products, and (iv) retailing high-quality, effective and dosable cannabis products to consumers. We appeal to medical and adult recreational use (“adult-use”) customers through brand strategies intended to build trust and loyalty.
We are a British Columbia company that began trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange on November 15, 2018 following the completion of the reverse takeover transaction (the “RTO”) between us and High Street Capital Partners, LLC (“High Street”), which is an indirect subsidiary of ours, on November 14, 2018. We were originally incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) on July 12, 1989 as “Applied Inventions Management Inc.”. On August 29, 2014, we changed our name to Applied Inventions Management Corp. We redomiciled from Ontario into British Columbia and changed our name to “Acreage Holdings, Inc.” on November 9, 2018.
Kevin Murphy, our Chairman, began investing in the cannabis space in 2011 with minority investments in dispensaries located in medical-use states on the east coast of the United States. High Street was founded by Mr. Murphy in April 2014 to invest in the burgeoning U.S. regulated cannabis market and, until April 2018, was an investment holding company and engaged in the business of investing in cannabis companies. As part of the formation of High Street in 2014, Mr. Murphy contributed his cannabis related investment portfolio valued at approximately $14 million to High Street in exchange for 20,000,000 Class B membership units of High Street.
We and High Street have invested in geographically diverse licensed entities that operate in both adult-use and medical-use authorized U.S. states. The companies and other entities in which we and High Street have a direct or indirect ownership interest (collectively, the “Subsidiaries”) focus on all aspects of the state regulated cannabis industry. As a result of its experience investing in the industry, and, in many cases, active involvement with the Subsidiaries, High Street’s management gained significant experience in cultivation, processing and dispensing of cannabis and cannabis infused products.
From inception until April 2018, when High Street began the process of converting its minority investments in many of the Subsidiaries into controlling interests, the principal business activity of High Street was to provide debt and equity capital to existing cannabis license holders, cannabis license applicants and related management companies which are party to financing and consulting services agreements with High Street-owned entities in certain U.S. states where medical-use and/or adult-use of cannabis is legal. Such investments included straight debt securities (secured or unsecured), convertible debt instruments and/or common or preferred equity securities issued by the Subsidiaries. As an investor in these Subsidiaries, High Street was generally entitled to hold board seats and played an advisory role in the management and operations of such Subsidiaries, which afforded High Street the opportunity to build its institutional knowledge in the cannabis space. Additionally, being an investor in the Subsidiaries provided High Street with the ability to develop a vertically-integrated U.S. cannabis market participant with one of the largest footprints in the industry at the time.
High Street is a Delaware limited liability company, or LLC, rather than a corporation. Unlike a corporation, generally all profits and losses of the business carried on by an LLC “pass through” to each member of the LLC. LLC members report their respective shares of such profits and losses on their U.S. federal tax returns. Membership equity interests in High Street are represented by units.
Since 2018, we have been, and continue to be, committed to providing access to cannabis’ beneficial properties by creating high quality products and consumer experiences. 
Strategy
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Acreage owns and operates cannabis businesses or has management or consulting services or other agreements to assist in operations in place with licensed operators in ten states. Through its subsidiaries, Acreage is engaged in, or has management or consulting services agreements in place with license holders to assist in the manufacture, processing, sale or distribution of cannabis in the adult-use or medical cannabis marketplace in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon and Pennsylvania. 
During 2020, as part of an overall strategic plan to focus on key, profitable operations we decided to continue to develop operations in the following nine core states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio. We expect this shift in focus to lead to margin improvements and accelerate our pathway to achieve positive returns.
During 2021, our strategy was further refined to focus on three key imperatives:
•Driving profitability;
•Strengthening our balance sheet; and
•Accelerating our growth in our core markets.
Driving Profitability: Acreage will prioritize its efforts on opportunities and markets that will improve operational and financial results. Management continues to diligently control costs, improve operational efficiencies, and accelerate organic growth in our core markets to continue to report improved profitability going forward.
Strengthening our Balance Sheet: Strengthening the balance sheet is key to both providing Acreage with the necessary capital to achieve our operational plans and building shareholder confidence. Acreage has worked to ensure that sufficient capital has been available when needed. Going forward, we will monitor the capital markets and utilize opportunities to access both debt or equity when it is necessary and advantageous to do so.
Accelerating our Growth in our Core Markets: Through prior acquisitions and capital expenditures, we believe Acreage is well positioned for future success in several key markets as regulations regarding the use of cannabis continue to evolve. As an example, Acreage has an established footprint in key markets such as New York and New Jersey and expects to benefit in the coming months and years as a result of the recent passage of adult-use programs in these states. We will continue to focus our growth on our core markets where we can take advantage of and expand on the presence already established. Additionally, we have streamlined our focus to the eight core states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio. We will also maintain a presence in the state of California to stay abreast of product innovation and brand development.
Our mission is to champion and provide access to cannabis’ beneficial properties by creating the highest quality medical and adult-use products and consumer experiences. Our operational strategy to deliver on our vision and mission revolves around four primary areas of focus: (1) cultivation; (2) retail; (3) processing/manufacturing; and (4) wholesale. While we focus on these four areas, we have determined that we have just one reportable business segment: the production and sale of cannabis products.
Recent Achievements
The implementation of the corporate strategy has resulted in many key accomplishments over the past 12 months:

Operational Footprint as of December 31, 2021
We and entities with which we have management services agreements have cultivating, processing & manufacturing, wholesaling, and retailing and/or distributing operations in ten states.
We own and operate 9 cultivation/manufacturing or processing facilities in eight states. Manufacturing and processing facilities are generally co-located with cultivation facilities. As of December 31, 2021, Acreage has 104,094 square feet of canopy for cannabis cultivation.
We own 27 operational dispensaries in eight states. Additionally, we have a management services agreement with an entity operating 1 dispensary. Our five dispensaries in Oregon are being divested and currently have a Management Service Agreement (“MSA”) and Letter of Intent (“LOI”).
Cultivation
Consistently growing high-quality cannabis is the one of the most important aspects of our business. In general, cannabis cultivation takes place in three settings: indoor, outdoor and in greenhouses. While it is cost effective to grow cannabis outdoors, it is also very hard to control pest infestations without the use of significant amounts of pesticides, and is subject to other risks such as severe weather, diseases and mold. As a result, cannabis grown outdoors is significantly lower in quality than cannabis grown indoors or in greenhouses. Our focus is growing the highest quality medicinal and adult-use cannabis. We therefore currently grow all of our cannabis in indoor and greenhouse facilities, which allows us to grow in organic conditions under ideal climate controls and without the use of pesticides or fertilizers.
Processing & Manufacturing 
In states where we are appropriately licensed, we take the high-quality cannabis flower we grow and process or manufacture that flower into various forms for consumer and patient consumption, including pre-rolls, and concentrated extracts for use in gel caps, edibles, beverages, and vape cartridges. Our manufacturing and processing facilities are capital intensive, and we may enter into sale and leaseback transactions with a real estate investment trust to finance build-outs of our facilities, when such transactions are advantageous to us and our shareholders.
Acreage has one of the top extraction teams in the cannabis industry. With our deep technical cannabis experience supported with an in-house data analytics team, Acreage has an agile product development workflow to continuously produce, test and launch new products. Data-driven decision making informs which products to scale in which markets across our footprint, acknowledging the diversity of markets in the United States. Acreage brands all hold the same consumer promise: that we will deliver the best possible cannabis products across all price points.
In most states, Acreage’s processing facilities are co-located with its cultivation facilities. Depending on the state, these manufacturing and processing facilities primarily produce our developed “House of Brands” products under brand names such as The Botanist, Prime and Superflux, as well as licensed brands such as Canopy Growth’s Tweed. We use or plan to use a variety of extraction methods ranging from CO2 to butane to ethanol depending on the product requirements.
Wholesale 
In addition to retail sales through our dispensaries, we have adopted a strategy of selling our flower and branded products in states with cultivation and processing operations and where allowable by law. We and our contractual affiliates sell branded products to licensed cannabis dispensaries in eight states. We view wholesale operations as a crucial business strategy for both cash flow generation and distribution of our developed brands for long-term brand building success. We believe our footprint affords us a competitive advantage to building long-term brand equity. We plan to increase wholesale revenue in states where we currently wholesale products and also to begin wholesale operations in new states where allowable by law.
Retail 
Acreage both operates licensed retail adult-use and medicinal cannabis dispensaries and has management services agreements with licensed dispensaries and provides assistance (but does not control) such entities in exchange for fees for such services. Generally, we seek to build out as many dispensaries as we are permitted by state rules and regulations under our existing licenses and we also continually evaluate acquisition targets to expand our dispensary footprint. Additionally, we plan to relocate one dispensary in New York to a superior location, having reopened retail operations consistent with COVID guidance, and are relocating an additional dispensary in New Jersey to service the adult-use and medicinal markets. We have also negotiated LOIs to divest our retail operations in Oregon. 
We design our dispensaries to provide the best possible experience to our customers. Where possible and to the extent permissible under state law, we feature our own cultivated, processed and manufactured products, but also feature other in-demand medicinal and adult-use products from other producers. Our flagship dispensary brand is The Botanist, which first launched in 2018. However, we also operate retail dispensaries under other names. In each instance, we consider whether to convert dispensaries to The Botanist brand and plan to do so where it makes sense commercially and is permissible by law. We view retail operations as one of our primary sources of cash flow for the foreseeable future.
Our flagship The Botanist retail concept brings a unique, consistent and scalable retail design and customer experience to cannabis that appeals to a wide range of adult-use and medicinal cannabis customers nationwide. Emphasizing the holistic and natural qualities of cannabis and delivered in an immersive retail experience that blends nature and science, The Botanist looks to deliver a level of education, sense of community, and welcoming experience lacking in most cannabis dispensaries. The staff is highly trained and knowledgeable to help provide insight and guidance to customers and patients as they explore the far-reaching benefits of cannabis.

Marketing and Brand Development
Acreage employs full-time, in-house marketing, retail, and product development functions. These functions engage in a range of brand-building activities and strategies, including market research, consumer insights research, new brand development, product innovation, copy & content production, design, packaging, retail operations and sales, to support business performance and growth at the local and national levels.
Acreage employs a focused ‘House of Brands’ approach to target specific consumer needs. Our brand development strategy includes in-house organic development where we see opportunities to add value. Acreage sells its developed, acquired, and licensed branded products in ten states, with plans to significantly increase distribution and expand form factors in 2022.
Acreage’s portfolio of product brands includes the following: 
The Botanist
The Botanist is a retail and product brand created to help wellness seekers. We’re here to listen and help guide guests as they discover cannabis and the power of herbal wellness. The Botanist is deeply rooted in health and wellness and focused on the holistic power of cannabis to help people live balanced lifestyles.

Prime Wellness’s high-quality products are distributed in 100% of Pennsylvania’s medical dispensaries, one of the largest medical cannabis markets in the country.
Tweed
Tweed is a Canopy Growth-developed brand; Acreage is responsible for its U.S. expansion. Tweed allows consumers to find their fit, offering an easy-to-understand product architecture. The brand launched in the U.S. with flower and is slated to expand into a full portfolio of classic yet innovative products. Tweed believes in being a good neighbor to the communities we serve, including providing responsible access to quality cannabis throughout our network.
Competition
The cannabis industry is highly competitive. We compete on quality, price, brand recognition, and distribution strength. Our cannabis products compete with other products for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail dispensaries and wholesaler attention. We compete with thousands of cannabis producing companies from small “mom and pop” operations to multi-billion-dollar market cap multi-state operators. 
Sources and Availability of Production Materials
The principal components in the production of our cannabis consumer packaged goods include cannabis grown internally or acquired through wholesale channels, other agricultural products, and packaging materials (including glass, plastic and cardboard).
Due to the U.S. federal prohibition on cannabis, Acreage must source cannabis within each individual state in which it operates. While there are opportunities for centralized sourcing of some packaging materials, given each state’s unique regulatory requirements, multi-state operators do not currently have access to nationwide production solutions.
Government Regulation
Cannabis companies operate in a highly regulated industry. We are subject to the laws and regulations in the states and localities in which we operate, and such laws vary by state and locality. Where we produce products, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, and may be required to obtain additional permits and licenses to operate our facilities. Where we market and sell products, we may be subject to laws and regulations on brand registration, packaging and labeling, 
distribution methods and relationships, pricing and price changes, sales promotions, advertising and public relations. We are also subject to rules and regulations relating to changes in officers or directors, ownership or control.
We comply in all material respects with all applicable governmental laws and regulations in the states in which we operate (including the applicable licensing requirements), with the exception of the U.S. federal prohibition of cannabis. We believe that the cost of administration and compliance with, and liability under, such laws and regulations does not have, and is not expected to have, a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Seasonality
In certain regions, especially on the West Coast, the cannabis industry can be subject to seasonality in some states that allow home grow. Because homegrown plants are typically harvested in the late summer or early fall, there can be some deceleration in retail and wholesale sales trends during these months as these private supplies are consumed.
Intellectual Property
As discussed above, we have developed a “House of Brands” that we believe will be valued consumer brands and a key pillar of our business strategy. Accordingly, we protect our brands and trademarks to the extent permissible under applicable law. We have applied for trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office which we believe are protectable under U.S. federal law and have applied for and received trademark protection at the state level. We have also submitted trademark applications in the European Union and Canada. 
We hold no patents. We also do not have any patents pending.
Emerging Growth Company

We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to avail ourselves of exemptions from various requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards. As a result, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

Circumstances could cause us to lose emerging growth company status. We will qualify as an emerging growth company until the earliest of:

•The last day of our first fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more;
•The last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering, which is December 31, 2024;
•The date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period; or
•The date on which we qualify as a “large accelerated filer” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) (qualifying as a large accelerated filer means, among other things, having a public float in excess of $700 million).
Human Capital
As of March 2, 2022, we had approximately 1,090 employees, 1,013 of whom were in field operations and 77 of whom were in corporate administration and management. We offer our employees opportunities to grow and develop their careers and provide them with a wide array of company paid benefits and compensation packages which we believe are competitive relative to our peers in the industry.
Employee safety and health in the workplace is one of our core values. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we have taken actions aligned with the 
World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect our workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work.
The Company’s number and levels of employees are continually aligned with the pace and growth of its business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. 
Acquisitions
As part of our strategy to deliver on our vision and mission, we may from time to time acquire entities or licenses to increase our existing presence in states where we or businesses with which we have agreements already operate or to expand our footprint into new states. The consideration we issue in connection with such acquisitions may include cash, equity in Acreage or High Street, notes payable or a mix of these forms of consideration. The following transactions were completed or entered into in 2021:
CWG Botanicals, Inc. (“CWG”)
On April 30, 2021, a subsidiary of the Company acquired 100% of CWG, an adult-use cannabis cultivation and processing operations in the state of California. The completion of this acquisition expands the Company’s footprint in California.
Greenleaf Apothecaries, LLC (“GLA”), Greenleaf Gardens, LLC (“GLG”), and Greenleaf Therapeutics, LLC (“GLT”), collectively known as “Greenleaf.”
On October 1, 2021, a subsidiary of the Company closed the acquisition of 100% the ownership interests in Greenleaf. Greenleaf consists of cannabis cultivation, processing, and dispensary operations in the state of Ohio. The completion of this acquisition establishes Acreage’s footprint in the Ohio cannabis market. 
NCC Real Estate, LLC (“NCCRE”)
On March 19, 2021, a subsidiary of the Company, HSC Solutions, LLC (“HSC Solutions”) entered into an assignment of membership agreement to acquire the remaining non-controlling interests of its subsidiary, NCCRE, based primarily on the fair value of property held by NCCRE.
Canopy Growth Corporation Arrangement 
On June 19, 2019, the shareholders of the Company and of Canopy Growth Corporation (“Canopy Growth”) separately approved the arrangement between the two companies, and on June 21, 2019, the Supreme Court of British Columbia granted a final order approving the arrangement. Effective June 27, 2019, the Articles of the Company were amended to provide Canopy Growth with the option (the “Canopy Growth Call Option”) to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company (each, an “Acreage Share”), with a requirement to do so upon a change in federal laws in the United States to permit the general cultivation, distribution and possession of marijuana (as defined in the relevant legislation) or to remove the regulation of such activities from the federal laws of the United States, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set out in the arrangement agreement entered into between Acreage and Canopy Growth on April 18, 2019, as amended on May 15, 2019 (the “Original Arrangement Agreement”).
On June 24, 2020, we entered into a proposal agreement (the “Proposal Agreement”) with Canopy Growth which set out the terms and conditions upon which us and Canopy Growth were proposing to enter into an amending agreement (the “Amending Agreement”), as further amended on September 23, 2020 (the “Arrangement Agreement”) and the amendment and restatement of the plan of arrangement implemented by us on June 24, 2019 (the “Amended Plan of Arrangement”) to implement the arrangement contemplated in the Arrangement Agreement (the “Amended Arrangement”). The effectiveness of the Amending Agreement and the implementation of the Amended Plan of Arrangement was subject to the conditions set out in the Proposal Agreement, which included, among others, approval by: (i) the Supreme Court of British Columbia (the “Court”) at a hearing upon the procedural and substantive fairness of the terms and conditions of the Amended Arrangement; and (ii) our shareholders, as required by applicable corporate and securities laws. The Amended Arrangement was approved by our shareholders at our special meeting held on September 16, 2020 and a final order approving the Amended Arrangement was obtained from the Court on September 18, 2020.
Following the satisfaction of various conditions set forth in the Proposal Agreement, on September 23, 2020, we entered into the Amending Agreement with Canopy Growth and implemented the Amended Plan of Arrangement effective at 12:01 a.m. (Vancouver time) (the “Amendment Time”) on September 23, 2020 (the “Amendment Date”). 
Pursuant to the Amended Plan of Arrangement, among other things, Canopy Growth made a cash payment of $37.5 million (the “Aggregate Amendment Option Payment”), to our shareholders and certain holders of securities convertible or exchangeable into our shares. Holders of our then outstanding Class A subordinate voting shares (the “SVS”), Class B proportionate voting shares (the “PVS”), Class C multiple voting shares (the “MVS”), and certain other parties, received approximately $0.30 per SVS, being their pro rata portion (on an as-converted to SVS basis) of the Aggregate Amendment Option Payment, based on the number of our outstanding shares and certain holders of securities convertible or exchangeable into our shares, as of the close of business on September 22, 2020, the record date for payment of the Aggregate Amendment Option Payment. The Aggregate Amendment Option Payment was distributed to such holders of record on or about September 25, 2020.
Upon implementation of the Amended Plan of Arrangement, our articles were amended to, among other things, create three new classes of shares in our authorized share structure, being Fixed Shares, Floating Shares and Class F multiple voting shares (the “Fixed Multiple Shares”), and, in connection with such amendment, we completed a capital reorganization (the “Capital Reorganization”) effective as of the Amendment Time whereby: (i) each then outstanding SVS was exchanged for 0.7 of a Fixed Share and 0.3 of a Floating Share; (ii) each then outstanding PVS was exchanged for 28 Fixed Shares and 12 Floating Shares; and (iii) each then outstanding MVS was exchanged for 0.7 of a Fixed Multiple Share and 0.3 of a Floating Share.
At the Amendment Time, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Amended Plan of Arrangement, each option, restricted share unit, compensation option and warrant to acquire SVS that was outstanding immediately prior to the Amendment Time was exchanged for a replacement option, restricted stock unit, compensation option or warrant, as applicable, to acquire Fixed Shares (a “Fixed Share Replacement Security”) and a replacement option, restricted stock unit, compensation option or warrant, as applicable, to acquire Floating Shares (a “Floating Share Replacement Security”) in order to account for the Capital Reorganization.
As a condition to implementation of the Amended Arrangement, an affiliate of Canopy Growth advanced the first tranche of $50 million of a loan of up to $100 million (the “Hempco Loan”) to Universal Hemp, LLC, an affiliate of the Company that operates solely in the hemp industry in full compliance with all applicable laws (“Universal Hemp”) pursuant to a secured debenture (the “Debenture”) bearing interest at a rate of 6.1% per annum and maturing 10 years from the date thereof. All interest payments made pursuant to the Debenture are payable in cash by Universal Hemp. The Debenture is not convertible and is not guaranteed by Acreage. A further $50 million advance will be made available upon satisfaction of specified conditions precedent. In accordance with the terms of the Debenture, the funds cannot be used, directly or indirectly, in connection with or for any cannabis or cannabis-related operations in the United States, unless and until such operations comply with all applicable laws of the United States. Refer to Note 5 and Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Pursuant to the Amended Plan of Arrangement, upon the occurrence, or waiver (at the discretion of Canopy Growth), of a change in federal laws in the United States to permit the general cultivation, distribution and possession of marijuana (as defined in the relevant legislation) or to remove the regulation of such activities from the federal laws of the United States (the “Triggering Event” and the date on which the Triggering Event occurs, the “Triggering Event Date”), Canopy Growth, will, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions set out in the Arrangement Agreement: (i) acquire all of the issued and outstanding Fixed Shares (following the mandatory conversion of the Fixed Multiple Shares into Fixed Shares) on the basis of 0.3048 (the “Fixed Exchange Ratio”) of a common share of Canopy Growth (each, a “Canopy Growth Share”) for each Fixed Share held at the time of the acquisition of the Fixed Shares (the “Acquisition Time”), subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Amended Plan of Arrangement (the “Canopy Call Option”); and (ii) have the right (but not the obligation) (the “Floating Call Option”), exercisable for a period of 30 days following the Triggering Event Date to acquire all of the issued and outstanding Floating Shares. Upon exercise of the Floating Call Option, Canopy Growth may acquire the Floating Shares for cash or for Canopy Growth Shares or a combination thereof, in Canopy Growth’s sole discretion. If paid in cash, the price per Floating Share shall be equal to the volume-weighted average trading price of the Floating Shares on the CSE (or other recognized stock exchange on which the Floating Shares are primarily traded as determined by volume) for the 30 trading day period prior to the exercise (or deemed exercise) of the Canopy Call Option, subject to a minimum amount of $6.41 (the “Floating Cash Consideration”). If paid in Canopy Growth Shares, each Floating Share will be exchanged for a number of Canopy Growth Shares equal to (i) the volume-weighted average trading price of the Floating Shares on the CSE (or other recognized stock exchange on which the Floating Shares are primarily traded as determined by volume) for the 30 trading day period prior to the exercise (or deemed exercise) of the Canopy Call Option, subject to a minimum amount of $6.41, divided by (ii) the volume-weighted average trading price (expressed in US$) of the Canopy Growth Shares on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) (or such other recognized stock exchange on which the Canopy Growth Shares are primarily traded if not then traded on the NYSE) for the 30 trading day period immediately prior to the exercise (or deemed exercise) of the Canopy Call Option (the “Floating Ratio”). The Canopy Call Option and the Floating Call Option will expire 10 years from the Amendment Time.
At the Acquisition Time, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Amended Plan of Arrangement, each Fixed Share Replacement Security will be exchanged for a replacement option, restricted stock unit, compensation option or warrant, as applicable, to acquire from Canopy Growth such number of Canopy Growth Shares as is equal to: (i) the number of Fixed Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Fixed Share Replacement Security immediately prior to the Acquisition Time, multiplied by (ii) the Fixed Exchange Ratio in effect immediately prior to the Acquisition Time (provided that if the foregoing would result in the issuance of a fraction of a Canopy Growth Share, then the number of Canopy Growth Shares to be issued will be rounded down to the nearest whole number).
In the event that the Floating Call Option is exercised and Canopy Growth acquires the Floating Shares at the Acquisition Time, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Amended Plan of Arrangement, each Floating Share Replacement Security will be exchanged for a replacement option, restricted stock unit, compensation option or warrant, as applicable, to acquire from Canopy Growth such number of Canopy Growth Shares as is equal to: (i) the number of Floating Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Floating Share Replacement Security immediately prior to the Acquisition Time, multiplied by (ii) the Floating Ratio (provided that if the foregoing would result in the issuance of a fraction of a Canopy Growth Share, then the number of Canopy Growth Shares to be issued will be rounded down to the nearest whole number).
In the event that Floating Call Option is exercised, and Canopy Growth acquires the Floating Shares at the Acquisition Time, we will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canopy Growth. If Canopy Growth completes the Acquisition of the Fixed Shares but does not acquire the Floating Shares, the Floating Call Option will terminate, and the Floating Shares shall remain outstanding. In such event, the Amending Agreement provides for, among other things: (i) various Canopy Growth rights that extend beyond the Acquisition Date and continue until Canopy Growth the date (the “End Date”) Canopy Growth ceases to hold at least 35% of the issued and outstanding Acreage shares. These include, among other things, rights to nominate a majority of Acreage’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) following the Acquisition Time, and restrictions on Acreage’s ability to conduct mergers and acquisitions above certain thresholds or incur certain indebtedness without Canopy Growth’s consent.
The Amending Agreement also provides that Acreage may issue a maximum of 32,700,000 shares (or convertible securities in proportion to the foregoing), which will include (i) 3,700,000 Floating Shares which are to be issued solely in connection with the exercise of stock options granted to Acreage management (the “Option Shares”); (ii) 8,700,000 Floating Shares other than the Option Shares; and (iii) 20,300,000 Fixed Shares, without a revision to the Fixed Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Amending Agreement provides that Acreage may not issue any equity securities, without Canopy Growth’s prior consent, other than: (i) upon the exercise or conversion of convertible securities outstanding as of the Amendment Date; (ii) contractual commitments existing as of the Amendment Date; (iii) the Option Shares; (iv) the issuance of up to $3.0 million worth of Fixed Shares pursuant to an at-the-market offering to be completed no more than four times during any one-year period; (v) the issuance of up to 500,000 Fixed Shares in connection with debt financing transactions that are otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, as amended by the Amending Agreement; or (vi) pursuant to one private placement or public offering of securities during any one-year period for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $20.0 million, subject to specific limitations as set out in the Amending Agreement.
Pursuant to the Amending Agreement, Acreage agreed to submit an Approved Business Plan to Canopy Growth which contains annual revenue and earnings targets for each of Acreage’s fiscal years ending on December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2029 (the “Initial Business Plan”). A number of factors may cause Acreage to fail to meet the Pro-Forma Net Revenue Targets or the Consolidated Adj. EBITDA Targets set forth in the Initial Business Plan. See “Risk Factors”. In the event that Acreage has not satisfied: (i) 90% of the Pro-Forma Net Revenue Target or the Consolidated Adj. EBITDA Target set forth in the Initial Business Plan, measured on a quarterly basis, an Interim Failure to Perform will occur and certain Austerity Measures shall become applicable. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company exceeded the 90% threshold for both the Pro-Forma Net Revenue Target and the Consolidated Adj. EBITDA Target set forth in the Initial Business Plan.

Regulatory Framework
In accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators Staff Notice 51-352 (Revised) - Issuers with U.S. Marijuana-Related Activities (“Staff Notice 51-352”), below is a discussion of the federal and state-level U.S. regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions where the Company is currently involved, through High Street, in the cannabis industry. High Street is, through its Subsidiaries, engaged in, or has management, consulting services or other agreements in place with license holders to assist in the manufacture, processing, sale or distribution of cannabis in the adult-use or medical cannabis marketplace in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon and Pennsylvania. In accordance with Staff Notice 51-352, the Company will evaluate, monitor and reassess this disclosure, and any related risks, on an ongoing basis and the same will be supplemented and amended to investors in public filings, including in the event of government policy changes or the introduction of new or amended guidance, laws or regulations regarding cannabis regulation. Any non-compliance, citations or notices of violation which may have an impact on the Company’s license, business activities or operations will be promptly disclosed by the Company.
United States Federal Overview
The United States federal government regulates drugs through the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (the “CSA”) which schedules controlled substances, including cannabis, based on their approved medical use and potential for abuse. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) defines Schedule I drugs, substances or chemicals as “drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.” The United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has not approved cannabis as a safe and effective drug for any condition. The FDA has approved CBD, a component of cannabis, for a narrow segment of medical conditions.
State laws that permit and regulate the production, distribution and use of cannabis for adult-use or medical purposes are in direct conflict with the CSA, which makes the production, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the U.S. authorize medical or adult-use cannabis production, distribution, and sale by licensed or registered entities, under U.S. federal law, the possession, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal and any such acts are criminal acts under any and all circumstances under the CSA. Although the Company’s activities are believed to be compliant with applicable United States state and local law, strict compliance with state 
and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under United States federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company.
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, medical use of cannabis is legal, with a doctor's recommendation, in thirty-seven (37) states, four (4) out of five (5) permanently inhabited U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia, with one (1) state pending enactment until a future date. Thirteen (13) other states have laws that limit THC content, for the purpose of allowing access to products that are rich in cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component of cannabis. The recreational use of cannabis is legal in eighteen (18) states, the District of Columbia, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam. Another thirteen (13) states and the U.S. Virgin Islands have decriminalized its use.
The U.S. administration under President Obama attempted to address the inconsistent treatment of cannabis under state and federal law in the Cole Memorandum which Deputy Attorney General James Cole sent to all U.S. Attorneys in August 2013 that outlined certain priorities for the DOJ relating to the prosecution of cannabis offenses. The Cole Memorandum held that enforcing federal cannabis laws and regulations in jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form and that have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations was not a priority for the DOJ. Instead, the Cole Memorandum directed U.S. Attorney’s Offices discretion not to investigate or prosecute state law compliant participants in the medical cannabis industry who did not implicate certain identified federal government priorities, including preventing interstate diversion or distribution of cannabis to minors.
On January 4, 2018, then U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions formally issued the Sessions Memorandum, which rescinded the Cole Memorandum effective upon its issuance. The Sessions Memorandum stated, in part, that current law reflects “Congress’ determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and cannabis activity is a serious crime”, and Mr. Sessions directed all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions when deciding whether to pursue prosecutions related to cannabis activities. As a result, federal prosecutors could, and still can, use their prosecutorial discretion to decide to prosecute actors compliant with their state laws. Although there have not been any identified prosecutions of state law compliant cannabis entities, there can be no assurance that the federal government will not enforce federal laws relating to cannabis in the future. Jeff Sessions resigned as U.S. Attorney General on November 7, 2018. 
On February 14, 2019, William Barr was confirmed as U.S. Attorney General. However, in a written response to questions from U.S. Senator Cory Booker made as a nominee, Attorney General Barr stated “I do not intend to go after parties who have complied with state law in reliance on the Cole Memo.” The Department of Justice under Mr. Barr did not take a formal position on federal enforcement of laws relating to cannabis. Mr. Barr has stated publicly that his preference would be to have a uniform federal rule against cannabis, but, absent such a uniform rule, his preference would be to permit the existing federal approach of leaving it up to the states to make their own decisions.
On March 10, 2021, Judge Merrick Garland was confirmed as U.S. Attorney General under President Biden. However, in response to questions from U.S. Senator Charles Grassley made as a nominee, Attorney General Garland stated “I do not think it the best use of the Department’s limited resources to pursue prosecutions of those who are complying with the laws in states that have legalized and are effectively regulating marijuana.” In October 2021, in a letter from U.S. Senators Booker and Elizabeth Warren to Attorney General Garland, the Senators advocated the federal decriminalization of cannabis by removing cannabis from the CSA’s list of controlled substances. To date, Attorney General Garland and the Department of Justice have not publicly responded to the Senators’ letter. Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law.
Although the Cole Memorandum remains rescinded, the sheer size of the cannabis industry, in addition to participation by state and local governments and investors, suggests that a large-scale enforcement operation would more than likely create unwanted political backlash for the DOJ. Regardless, cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level, and neither the Cole Memorandum nor its rescission has altered that fact. The federal government of the United States has always reserved the right to enforce federal law in regard to the sale and disbursement of medical or adult-use cannabis, even if state law sanctioned such sale and disbursement. The Company believes, from a purely legal perspective, that the criminal risk today remains similar to the risk on January 3, 2018. It remains unclear whether the risk of enforcement has been altered. If Department of Justice policy under Attorney General Garland were to shift and the Department of Justice began to aggressively pursue financiers or owners of cannabis-related businesses, then the Company could face (i) seizure of its cash and other assets used to support or derived from its cannabis operations, (ii) the arrest of its employees, directors, officers, managers and investors, and charges of ancillary criminal violations of the CSA for aiding and abetting and conspiring to violate the CSA by virtue of providing financial support to cannabis companies that service or provide goods to state-licensed or permitted 
cultivators, processors, distributors, and/or retailers of cannabis, and/or (iii) the barring of its employees, directors, officers, managers and investors who are not United States citizens from entry into the United States for life. Additionally, under United States federal law, it may potentially be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from the sale of cannabis or any other Schedule I controlled substance. Canadian banks are likewise hesitant to deal with cannabis companies, due to the uncertain legal and regulatory framework of the industry. Banks and other financial institutions, particularly those that are federally chartered in the United States, could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to cannabis businesses. While Congress is considering legislation that may address these issues, there can be no assurance that such legislation passes. 
Despite these laws, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued a memorandum on February 14, 2014 (the “FinCEN Memorandum”) outlining the pathways for financial institutions to bank state-sanctioned cannabis businesses in compliance with federal enforcement priorities. The FinCEN Memorandum echoed the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum and states that in some circumstances, it is permissible for banks to provide services to cannabis-related businesses without risking prosecution for violation of federal money laundering laws. Under these guidelines, financial institutions must submit a Suspicious Activity Report (“SAR”) in connection with all cannabis-related banking activities by any client of such financial institution, in accordance with federal money laundering laws. These cannabis-related SARs are divided into three categories - cannabis limited, cannabis priority, and cannabis terminated - based on the financial institution’s belief that the business in question follows state law, is operating outside of compliance with state law, or where the banking relationship has been terminated, respectively. On the same day that the FinCEN Memorandum was published, the DOJ issued a memorandum (the “2014 Cole Memorandum”) directing prosecutors to apply the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum in determining whether to charge individuals or institutions with crimes related to financial transactions involving the proceeds of cannabis-related conduct. The 2014 Cole Memorandum has been rescinded as of January 4, 2018, along with the Cole Memorandum, removing guidance that enforcement of applicable financial crimes against state-compliant actors was not a DOJ priority.
However, former Attorney General Sessions’ revocation of the Cole Memorandum and the 2014 Cole Memorandum has not affected the status of the FinCEN Memorandum, nor has the Department of the Treasury given any indication that it intends to rescind the FinCEN Memorandum itself. Though it was originally intended for the 2014 Cole Memorandum and the FinCEN Memorandum to work in tandem, the FinCEN Memorandum is a standalone document which explicitly lists the eight enforcement priorities originally cited in the Cole Memorandum. As such, the FinCEN Memorandum remains intact, indicating that the Department of the Treasury and FinCEN intend to continue abiding by its guidance. However, in the United States, it is difficult for cannabis-based businesses to open and maintain a bank account with any bank or other financial institution.
Although the Cole Memorandum has been rescinded, one legislative safeguard for the medical cannabis industry, appended to federal appropriations legislation, remains in place. Currently referred to as the “Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment”, this so-called “rider” provision has been appended to the Consolidated Appropriations Acts every year since fiscal year 2015. Under the terms of the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer rider, the federal government is prohibited from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal cannabis laws against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. On December 20, 2019, then President Donald Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 which included the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, which prohibits the funding of federal prosecutions with respect to medical cannabis activities that are legal under state law. On December 27, 2020, the omnibus spending bill passed including the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, extending its application until September 30, 2021. Congress did not pass the next spending bill before the September 30, 2021 deadline, and as of the date of this filing, has still not passed an appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2022. On December 3, 2021, President Biden signed the Further Extending Government Funding Act which included the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer amendment, extending its application through February 18, 2022. On February 8, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a stopgap appropriations bill that would extend agency funding, and the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, until March 11, 2022. As of the date of this filing the bill had yet to be taken up by the U.S. Senate. If Congress acts as it has in prior years, it is likely pass another continuing resolution before funding expires on February 18, 2022 that will extend previous funding levels and riders through mid-March, including the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment. While there can be no assurances that the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment will be included in future appropriations bills to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal cannabis laws against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. 
Despite the legal, regulatory, and political obstacles the cannabis industry currently faces, the industry has continued to grow. It was anticipated that the federal government would eventually repeal the federal prohibition on cannabis and thereby leave the states to decide for themselves whether to permit regulated cannabis cultivation, production and sale, just as states are free today to decide policies governing the distribution of alcohol or tobacco. 
Given current political trends, however, these developments are considered unlikely in the near-term. As an industry best practice, despite the recent rescission of the Cole Memorandum, the Company abides by the following to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum:
•ensure that its operations are compliant with all licensing requirements as established by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions;
•ensure that its cannabis related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained (for example: in the states where cannabis is permitted only for adult-use, the products are only sold to individuals who meet the requisite age requirements);
•implement policies and procedures to ensure that cannabis products are not distributed to minors;
•implement policies and procedures in place to ensure that funds are not distributed to criminal enterprises, gangs or cartels; 
•implement an inventory tracking system and necessary procedures to ensure that such compliance system is effective in tracking inventory and preventing diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into those states where cannabis is not permitted by state law, or cross any state lines in general; 
•ensure that its state-authorized cannabis business activity is not used as a cover or pretense for trafficking of other illegal drugs, and is not engaged in any other illegal activity, or any activities that are contrary to any applicable anti-money laundering statutes; and
•ensure that its products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving.
In addition, the Company may (and frequently does) conduct background checks to ensure that the principals and management of its operating subsidiaries are of good character, and have not been involved with other illegal drugs, engaged in illegal activity or activities involving violence, or use of firearms in cultivation, manufacturing or distribution of cannabis. The Company will also conduct ongoing reviews of the activities of its cannabis businesses, the premises on which they operate and the policies and procedures that are related to possession of cannabis or cannabis products outside of the licensed premises, including the cases where such possession is permitted by regulation. See “Risk Factors.”
The Cole Memorandum and the Rohrabacher/Blumenauer Amendment gave medical cannabis operators and investors in states with legal regimes greater certainty regarding federal enforcement as to establish cannabis businesses in those states.  Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. 
Despite the expanding market for legal cannabis, traditional sources of financing, including bank lending or private equity capital, are lacking which can be attributable to the fact that cannabis remains a Schedule I substance under the CSA. These traditional sources of financing are expected to remain scarce unless and until the federal government legalizes cannabis cultivation and sales. 
Pursuant to Staff Notice 51-352, issuers with U.S. cannabis-related activities are expected to clearly and prominently disclose certain prescribed information in prospectus filings and other required disclosure documents, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

State-Level Overview & Compliance Summary
While the Company and High Street are in compliance with the rules, regulations and license requirements governing each state in which the subsidiaries and contractual parties operate, there are significant risks associated with their business and the 
business of the subsidiaries and contractual parties. Further, the rules and regulations as outlined below are not a full complement of all the rules that the subsidiaries are required to follow in each applicable state.
Although each state has its own laws and regulations regarding the operation of cannabis businesses, certain of the laws and regulations are consistent across jurisdictions. As a general matter, to operate legally under state law, cannabis operators must obtain a license from the state and in certain states must also obtain local approval. In those states where local approval is required, local authorization is a prerequisite to obtaining state licenses, and local governments are permitted to prohibit or otherwise regulate the types and number of cannabis businesses allowed in their locality. The license application and license renewal processes are unique to each state. However, each state’s application process requires a comprehensive criminal history, regulatory history, financial and personal disclosures, coupled with stringent monitoring and continuous reporting requirements designed to ensure only good actors are granted licenses and that licensees continue to operate in compliance with the state regulatory program.
License applicants for each state must submit standard operating procedures describing how the operator will, among other requirements, secure the facility, manage inventory, comply with the state’s seed-to-sale tracking requirements, dispense cannabis, and handle waste, as applicable to the license sought. Once the standard operating procedures are determined compliant and approved by the applicable state regulatory agency, the licensee is required to abide by the processes described and seek regulatory agency approval before any changes to such procedures may be made. Licensees are additionally required to train their employees on compliant operations and are only permitted to transact with other legal and licensed businesses.
As a condition of each state’s licensure, operators must consent to inspections of the commercial cannabis facility as well as the facility’s books and records to monitor and enforce compliance with state law. Many localities have also enacted similar standards for inspections and have already commenced both site-visits and compliance inspections for operators who have received state temporary or annual licensure.
To strengthen the communication and transparency between High Street and its subsidiaries, High Street and its subsidiaries utilize a third-party enterprise compliance platform, which facilitates a regulatory document control workflow for each state and can issue alerts for time sensitive information requests for events such as license renewal or an impending inspection. The software features a robust auditing system that allows for both internal as well as third-party compliance auditing, covering all state, municipal, facility and operational requirements. The third-party software facilitates the implementation and maintenance of compliant operations and can track all required licensing maintenance criteria, which includes countdown features and automatically generated reminders for initiating renewals and required reporting. Though the Company and High Street strive to comply with all aspects of the required state regulations, they believe that the core to ensuring a comprehensive compliance program is to weigh the risk of each regulation and ensure on a regular basis that the operators are properly controlling these risks.
Acreage monitors the applicable rules and regulations of each state in which it has, indirectly through its subsidiaries, licenses, permits, or operations. Acreage maintains a database and tracks each license or permit held by its subsidiaries, showing the renewal date, inspection schedules, and the results of any regulatory inspection reports. Acreage enhances its compliance program through subscription to a web-based service that provides access to cannabis-related state, county, municipal and federal rules and regulations which organizes the laws into distinct categories (such as taxation, zoning, application and licensing, and packaging and labeling) and sorts them by license type (such as cultivation, dispensary and testing). Acreage will also monitor any action taken by its subsidiaries in response to a change of governing regulations or suggestions from regulators. 
Acreage’s legal compliance team continually monitors and reviews correspondence and changes to, and updates of, rules or regulatory policies impacting Acreage and the operation of the businesses carried on by its subsidiaries in each U.S. state in which it has operations. Acreage has employed an experienced team of legal and compliance professionals with expertise in regulatory and corporate compliance to oversee its activities. The team led by the Company’s General Counsel, includes a former Assistant U.S. Attorney; a former SEC enforcement attorney and experienced compliance professional; and three experienced corporate attorneys and one paralegal. Acreage has a Director of Operational Compliance who oversees a team that focuses on state-by-state operational compliance issues. Acreage’s legal compliance team has implemented internal policies and procedures at corporate and subsidiary levels designed to mitigate any lapses in its overall infrastructure and facilitate compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Acreage strives to ensure its overall operations are in compliance with U.S. state law and the related licensing framework (see “Regulatory Framework - The Regulatory Landscape on a U.S. State Level). Marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance in the U.S. and therefore federally illegal. Acreage has not received any non-compliance citations or notices of violation which may have a material impact on its licenses, business activities or operations.
Acreage is classified as having a “direct,” “indirect” and “ancillary” involvement in the United States cannabis industry and it, each of its subsidiaries and, to the best of its knowledge, each entity through which it has ancillary involvement in the United States cannabis industry, is in compliance with applicable United States state law and related licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by each of the states in which it has operations. The Company is not subject to any citations or notices of violation with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory frameworks which may have a material impact on its licenses, business activities or operations. The Company uses reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that its business is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory frameworks enacted by each state, through the advice of its Director of Legal Compliance, and its Director of Operational Compliance, who monitor and review its business practices and changes to U.S. federal and state enforcement priorities and rules. The Company’s General Counsel and his legal team work with external legal counsel to ensure that the Company is in on-going compliance with applicable state law. These advisors have provided legal advice to the subsidiaries regarding, among other things, (a) compliance with applicable state regulatory frameworks, and (b) potential exposure and implications arising from U.S. federal law. In addition, the Company has designated individuals with responsibility for overseeing day-to-day compliance at each facility in which the Company maintains operational control. 
The Company will continue to use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure it is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted in states where it conducts business by continuous review of its licenses and affirmation certifications from management. The Company has engaged state and local regulatory/compliance counsel engaged in jurisdictions in which it operates. 
The Company has a commitment to training its personnel on the relevant issues in order to facilitate its overall compliance effort. The Company’s training program includes, among other items, the following topics:
•importance of compliance with state and local laws;
•dispensing procedures;
•patient privacy;
•security and safety policies and procedures;
•inventory control;
•quality control;
•cash management and control; and
•transportation procedures.
The Company’s training program emphasizes security and inventory control to ensure strict monitoring of cannabis and inventory from delivery to sale or disposal. Only authorized, properly trained employees are allowed to access the Company’s computerized seed- to-sale system. All of the Company’s facilities are monitored 24-hours a day, seven days a week. Visitors to the facilities are only permitted in strict accordance with relevant state laws and appropriately monitored and logged in.
The Company’s compliance team closely monitors and promptly addresses all compliance notifications from the regulators and inspectors in each market, in an effort to resolve any issues identified on a timely basis. The Company keeps records of all compliance notifications received from the state regulators or inspectors and how and when the issue was resolved. 
Further, the Company has created comprehensive standard operating procedures that include detailed descriptions and instructions for receiving shipments of inventory, inventory tracking, recordkeeping and record retention practices related to inventory, as well as procedures for performing inventory reconciliation and ensuring the accuracy of inventory tracking and recordkeeping. The Company maintains records of its inventory at all licensed facilities. Adherence to the Company’s standard operating procedures is mandatory and ensures that the Company’s operations are compliant with the rules set forth by the applicable state and local laws, regulations, ordinances, licenses and other requirements. The Company ensures adherence to standard operating procedures by regularly conducting internal inspections and is committed to ensuring any issues identified are resolved quickly and thoroughly.
In order to comply with industry best practices, despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, the Company continues to do the following to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum:
•Ensure the operations are compliant with all licensing requirements that are set forth with regards to cannabis operation by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions. To this end, the Company uses its internal Legal Department including its Legal Compliance team and retains appropriately experienced legal counsel to conduct the necessary due diligence to ensure compliance of such operations with all applicable regulations;
•The activities relating to cannabis business adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained. For example, in Florida only medical cannabis is permitted and therefore the products are only sold to patients who have the appropriate recommendation in the state registry and have a valid state-issued medical identification card;
•The Company only works through licensed operators, which must pass a range of requirements, adhere to strict business practice standards and be subjected to strict regulatory oversight whereby sufficient checks and balances ensure that no revenue is distributed to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels; and
•The Company conducts reviews of products and product packaging to ensure that the products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving.
The Company will continue to monitor compliance on an ongoing basis in accordance with its compliance program and standard operating procedures. While the Company’s operations strive to be in compliance with all applicable state laws, regulations and licensing requirements, some of such activities remain illegal under United States federal law. For the reasons described above and the risks further described in Risk Factors below, there are significant risks associated with the business of the Company. See “Risk Factors”.
The Regulatory Landscape on a U.S. State Level 
California
California Legislative History
In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act allowing physicians to legally recommend medical cannabis for patients who would benefit from cannabis. The Compassionate Use Act legalized the use, possession and cultivation of medical cannabis for a set of qualifying conditions including AIDS, anorexia, arthritis, cachexia, cancer and chronic pain. The law established a not-for-profit patient/caregiver system but there was no state licensing authority to oversee the businesses that emerged as a result.
In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills, collectively known as the “Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act”. The Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act established a licensing and regulatory framework for the medical cannabis businesses in California. Multiple agencies oversee different aspects of the program and require businesses obtain a state license and local approval to operate.
In November 2016, voters in California passed Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (“AUMA”) creating an adult-use cannabis program for individuals 21 years of age or older. AUMA contained conflicting provisions with the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act. Consequently, in June 2017, the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 94, known as the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MAUCRSA”), which combined the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act and AUMA to provide a set of regulations to govern medical and adult-use licensing regime for cannabis businesses. The three agencies that regulate cannabis at the state level are: (a) the California Department of Food and Agriculture, via CalCannabis, which issues licenses to cannabis cultivators; (b) the California Department of Public Health, via the Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch, which issues licenses to cannabis manufacturers; and (c) the California Department of Consumer Affairs, via the Bureau of Cannabis Control, which issues licenses to cannabis distributors, testing laboratories, retailers, and micro-businesses. These agencies also oversee the various aspects of implementing and maintaining California’s cannabis landscape, including the statewide track and trace system. 
To legally operate a medical or adult-use cannabis business in California, the operator must have both local approval and a state license. This requires license holders to operate in cities with cannabis licensing and approval programs. Municipalities in California are authorized to determine the number of licenses they will issue to cannabis operators, or can choose to outright ban the cultivation, manufacturing or the retail sale of cannabis. MAUCRSA went into effect on January 1, 2018.
On May 18, 2018, the California Department of Consumer Affairs, the California Department of Public Health and the California Department of Food and Agriculture proposed to re-adopt their emergency cannabis regulations. The three licensing authorities proposed changes to the regulatory provisions to provide greater clarity to licensees and to address issues that have arisen since the emergency regulations went into effect in December 2017. Highlighted among the changes are that applicants may now complete one license application which will allow for both medical and adult-use cannabis activity. These emergency cannabis regulations were officially readopted on June 4, 2018 and came into effect on June 6, 2018. On January 16, 2019, California’s three state cannabis licensing authorities announced that the Office of Administrative Law officially approved state regulations for cannabis businesses. The final cannabis regulations took effect immediately and superseded the previous emergency regulations. 
California Licenses
Although vertical integration across multiple license types is allowed under the state regulations, it is not required. CWG Botanicals, Inc. (“CWG”), a subsidiary of the Company, holds three licenses in California and has received local approval to operate under such licenses. CWG holds cultivation/grow, manufacturing and distribution licenses. The manufacturing license is denoted as a Type 7 which provides CWG the authorization to manufacture cannabis products using volatile solvent as well as non-volatile extraction methods. Each license issued gives CWG the ability to operate as a medical and adult-use provider. Gravenstein Foods LLC (“Gravenstein”), a subsidiary of the Company, holds a temporary manufacturing license. The manufacturing license is denoted as a Type 6 which provides Gravenstein the authorization to manufacture cannabis products using only non-volatile extraction methods. On July 15, 2019, Kanna, Inc. (“Kanna”), a subsidiary of the Company, was awarded an Adult-Use and Medicinal - Retailer Provisional License, which allows Kanna to open a dispensary and was awarded an Adult-Use and Medicinal - Retailer Provisional License, which allows Kanna to open a dispensary. 
California License Types 
Once an operator obtains local approval, the operator must obtain state licenses before conducting any commercial marijuana activity. There are 12 different license types that cover all commercial activity. License types 1-3 authorize the cultivation of medical and/or adult-use marijuana plants. Type 4 licenses are for nurseries that cultivate and sell clones and “teens” (immature marijuana plants that have established roots but require further vegetation prior to being sent into the flowering period). Type 6 and 7 licenses authorize manufacturers to process marijuana biomass into certain value-added products such as shatter or marijuana distillate oil with the use of volatile or non-volatile solvents, depending on the license type. Type 8 licenses are held by testing facilities who test samples of marijuana products and generate “certificates of analysis,” which include important information regarding the potency of products and whether products have passed or failed certain threshold tests for pesticide and microbiological contamination. Type 9 licenses are issued to “non-storefront” retailers, commonly called delivery services, who bring marijuana products directly to customers and patients at their residences or other chosen delivery location. Type 10 licenses are issued to storefront retailers, or dispensaries, which are open to the public and sell marijuana products onsite. Type 11 licenses are known as “Transport-Only” distribution licenses, and they allow the distributor to transport marijuana and marijuana products between licensees, but not to retailers. Type 12 licenses are issued to distributors who move marijuana and marijuana products to all license types, including retailers. 
The below table lists the licenses issued to CWG, Gravenstein, and Kanna, Inc.:

Subsidiary | License Number | City | Expiration Date | Description 
CWG Botanicals, Inc. | CCL18-0000104 | Oakland | 4/17/2022 | Grow 
CWG Botanicals, Inc. | CDPH- 10002775 | Oakland | 4/24/2022 | Manufacturing
CWG Botanicals, Inc. | C11-0000434-LIC | Oakland | 6/19/2022 | Distribution 
Gravenstein Foods LLC | CDPH-10003051 | Oakland | 5/1/2022 | Manufacturing
Kanna, Inc. | C10-0000419-LIC | Oakland | 7/14/2022 | Retailer 

In September 2018, the Governor of California approved the Senate Bill 1459 (“SB-1459”). SB-1459 created a new scheme of provisional licenses for cannabis operators. This provisional licensing scheme was essentially intended to replace the temporary licensing scheme. SB-1459 was necessary because the three main state cannabis licensing agencies - the Bureau of Cannabis Control (“BCC”), California Department of Public Health (“CDPH”), and California Department of Food and Agriculture (“CDFA”) - and localities which issue permits to cannabis operators, were all backlogged with numerous applications and couldn’t process all of the applications in time for applicants to get operational in 2018. The steps, per SB-1459 to obtain a provisional license are as follows: (1) an applicant must hold or previously have held a temporary license for the same commercial cannabis activity for which it seeks a provisional, and (2) the applicant must submit a completed annual license application and proof that California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”) compliance is underway. Provisional licenses last for 12 months and can be issued through the end of 2019.
Currently CWG holds one provisional license for distribution, one provisional license for manufacturing and one provisional license for cultivation. Gravenstein holds one provisional manufacturing license. Kanna holds a provisional license for a dispensary. Gravenstein and Kanna are currently not operational. Those license holders which have a provisional or annual license, must be compliant with METRC 30 days after receiving their licenses. An application for renewal of a cultivation license shall be submitted to the state at least 30 calendar days prior to the expiration date of the current license. A license holder that does not submit a completed license renewal application to the state within 30 calendar days after the expiration of 
the current license forfeits their eligibility to apply for a license renewal and, instead, would be required to submit a new license application. The license holders must ensure that no cannabis may be sold, delivered, transported or distributed by a producer from or to a location outside of the state. 
Retail Compliance in California
California requires that certain warnings, images, and content information be printed on all marijuana packaging. BCC regulations also include certain requirements about tamper-evident and child-resistant packaging. Distributors and retailers are responsible for confirming that products are properly labeled and packaged before they are sold to a customer. 
Consumers aged 21 and up may purchase marijuana in California from a dispensary with an “adult-use” license. Some localities still only allow medicinal dispensaries. Consumers aged 18 and up with a valid physician’s recommendation may purchase marijuana from a medicinal-only dispensary or an adult-use dispensary. Consumers without valid physician’s recommendations may not purchase marijuana from a medicinal-only dispensary. All marijuana businesses are prohibited from hiring employees under the age of 21. 
California Record-keeping/Reporting
California has selected METRC as the T&T system used to track commercial cannabis activity. CWG uses a third-party platform, QuantumLeap, which feeds data to METRC to meet all reporting requirements. 
Licensees are required to maintain records for at least seven years from the date a record is created. These records include: (a) a cultivation plan, (b) all supporting documentation for data or information input into the T&T system, (c) all unique identifiers (“UID”) assigned to product in inventory and all unassigned UIDs, (d) financial records related to the licensed commercial cannabis activity, including bank statements, tax records, sales invoices and receipts, and records of transport and transfer to other licensed facilities, (e) records related to employee training for the T&T system, and (f) permits, licenses, and other local authorizations to conduct the licensee’s commercial cannabis activity.
California Inventory/Storage
Each licensee is required to assign an account manager to oversee the T&T system. The account manager is fully trained on the system and is accountable to record all commercial cannabis activities accurately and completely. The licensee is expected to correct any data that is entered into the T&T system in error within three business days of discovery of the error.
The licensee is required to report information in the T&T system for each transfer of cannabis or non-manufactured cannabis products to, or cannabis or non-manufactured cannabis products received from, other licensed operators. Licensees must use the T&T system for all inventory tracking activities at a licensed premise, including, but not limited to, reconciling all on-premise and in-transit cannabis or non-manufactured cannabis product inventories at least once every 14 business days. The licensee must store cannabis and cannabis products in a secure place with locked doors.
California Security
A licensee is required to maintain an alarm system capable of detecting and signaling the presence of a threat requiring urgent attention and to which law enforcement are expected to respond. A licensee must also ensure a professionally qualified alarm company operator or one of its registered alarm agents installs, maintains, monitors, and responds to the alarm system.
The manufacturing and cultivation of cannabis must use a digital video surveillance system which runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week and effectively and clearly records images of the area under surveillance. Each camera must be placed in a location that clearly records activity occurring within 20 feet of all points of entry and exit on the licensed premises. The areas that will be recorded on the video surveillance system should include the following: (a) areas where cannabis goods are weighed, packed, stored, loaded, and unloaded for transportation, prepared, or moved within the premises, (b) limited-access areas, (c) security rooms, and (d) areas storing a surveillance-system storage device with at least one camera recording the access points to the secured surveillance recording area. Surveillance recordings must be kept for a minimum of 90 days.
California Transportation
Transporting cannabis goods between licensees and a licensed facility may only be performed by persons holding a distributor license. The vehicle or trailer used must not contain any markings or features on the exterior which may indicate or identify the contents or purpose. All cannabis products must be locked in a box, container, or cage that is secured to the inside of the vehicle or trailer. When left unattended, vehicles must be locked and secured. At a minimum, the vehicle must be equipped with an alarm system, motion detectors, pressure switches, duress, panic, and hold-up alarms.
California Inspections
All licensees are subject to annual and random inspections of their premises. Cultivators may be inspected by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the California Regional Water Quality Control Boards, and the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Manufacturers are subject to inspection by the California Department of Public Health, and Retailers, Distributors, Testing Laboratories, and Delivery services are subject to inspection by the Bureau of Cannabis Control. Inspections can result in notices to correct, or notices of violation, fines, or other disciplinary action by the inspecting agency.
Marijuana Taxes in California
Several types of taxes are imposed in California for adult-use sale. As of January 1, 2020, the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration raised the tax rate on wholesale cannabis from 60% to 80%. Cultivators have the choice of being taxed at $9.65, per dry-weight ounce of cannabis flowers or $1.35 per ounce of wet-weight plants. Further, cultivators are required to pay $2.87 per ounce for fresh frozen biomass. California also imposes an excise tax of 15%. Cities and counties apply their sales tax along with the state’s excise and many cities and counties have also authorized the imposition of special cannabis business taxes which can range from 2% to 10% of gross receipts of the business. The Company has retained legal counsel and/or other advisors in connection with California’s marijuana regulatory program. The Company has developed standard operating procedures for licenses who are operational. 
U.S. Attorney Statements in California
To the knowledge of management of the Company, other than as disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have not been any statements or guidance made by federal authorities or prosecutors regarding the risk of enforcement action in California.
Connecticut
Connecticut Legislative History
Connecticut’s Medical Marijuana Program (the “CT Program”) was enacted on June 1, 2012 with the signing into law of Act 12-55, the Act Concerning the Palliative Use of Marijuana (the “CT Act”). The CT Program protects patients and caregivers who hold valid medical cannabis registration cards from prosecution for possession of cannabis obtained from licensed dispensaries. Patients are eligible for a medical cannabis registration card if they have a qualifying debilitating medical condition, obtain a medical cannabis recommendation from a CT Program registered physician, and register as a qualified patient through the CT Program. In August 2018, the list of qualifying debilitating medical conditions was raised from 22 to 31 adding among other conditions, muscular dystrophy, chronic neuropathic pain and severe rheumatoid arthritis to the list which already included, among others, cancer, HIV/AIDS, Parkinson’s disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. In 2019, the list of qualifying conditions was expanded from 31 to 36 adding among other conditions, Tourette syndrome and intractable neuropathic pain that is unresponsive to standard medical treatments. Caregivers may register with the CT Program if they are designated by a qualifying patient, receive certification from a registered physician, and pass a criminal background check. The good standing of patients, caregivers, and physicians under the CT Program is subject to timely reporting and annual renewal requirements. 
On June 22, 2021, Connecticut passed legislation legalizing the adult-use of cannabis. The state aims to commence retail sales of cannabis by the end of 2022. 
Connecticut Licenses
The CT DCP is responsible for the CT Program and is authorized to issue dispensary and producer/grower licenses.
The table below lists the licenses issued to the Company’s indirect subsidiaries operating in Connecticut:

Subsidiary | License number | City | Expiration Date | Description 
D&B Wellness, LLC | MMDF.0000003 | Danbury | 5/13/2022 | Dispensary Facility
Prime Wellness of Connecticut, LLC | MMDF.0000004 | South Windsor | 4/10/2023 | Dispensary Facility
Thames Valley Apothecary, LLC | MMDF.0000005 | Uncasville | 4/15/2023 | Dispensary Facility

Each license qualifies a dispensary to purchase medical cannabis in good faith from licensed medical cannabis producers and to dispense cannabis to qualifying patients or primary caregivers that are registered under the CT Program. Dispensary license holders are required to ensure that no cannabis is sold, delivered, transported, or distributed to a location outside of Connecticut. Under the CT Program, dispensary licenses are renewed annually. Renewal applications must be submitted 45 days prior to license expiration and any renewal submitted more than 30 days after expiration will not be renewed.
Connecticut Record-keeping/Reporting
Connecticut does not mandate use of any singular unified T&T system by which all dispensary license holders submit data directly to the state. Acreage’s license holders, D&B Wellness, LLC, d/b/a Compassionate Care Center of Connecticut, and Prime Wellness of Connecticut, LLC, use a third-party solution, THC BioTrack, to push data to the state in order to meet all reporting requirements. Thames Valley Apothecary, LLC (“Thames Valley”) uses Leaf Logix Technology as their third-party solution. 
The CT Program provides strict guidelines for reporting via the license holder’s third-party T&T system. Every cannabis sale must be documented at the point of sale including recording the date and purchaser’s signature. At least once per day, all sales must be uploaded via the T&T system to the Connecticut Prescription Monitoring Program which accumulates and tracks medical cannabis purchases across all Connecticut dispensaries. The CT Program requires that records are kept for a minimum of three years.
Connecticut Inventory
Upon receipt of a cannabis product, each product must be cataloged and entered in the dispensary’s T&T system. The information required by the CT Program includes the quantity of product received, its lot number, expiration date, and strain. Only registered dispensary pharmacists may accept delivery of cannabis and related products. A delivery receipt for cannabis and cannabis products must be signed by the accepting dispensary pharmacist and be attached to the delivery manifest. Each delivery manifest must be kept on file for three years. Once per week, a count of cannabis product stock is to be conducted by a dispensary pharmacist which includes tracking the producer’s name, type and quantity of cannabis, and a summary of inventory findings. Any discrepancies must be rectified and documented. Any unrectified discrepancy must be disclosed to the dispensary manager who, if necessary, will notify the CT DCP. Annual controlled substance inventories are required to be conducted on a date specified by the dispensary manager and to be kept on file for three years.
Connecticut Storage/Security
The CT Program requires that dispensaries adhere to strict cannabis storage and security guidelines to maintain control against diversion, theft, and loss of cannabis or cannabis products. Each dispensary is required to (a) establish a security plan including approved safes for storage of all cannabis products, (b) maintain daily supplies of product in locked cabinets, (c) install safes accessible only to the dispensary pharmacist or manager, (d) utilize commercial grade motion detectors and video cameras in all areas that contain cannabis, and (e) install cameras directed at all safes, vaults, dispensing and sale areas, or any other area where cannabis is stored or handled.
Furthermore, the CT Act prescribes that dispensaries must retain and present all video upon request of the CT DCP. Specifically, dispensaries must (a) make the latest 24 hours of video readily available for immediate viewing upon request of a state authorized representative, and (b) retain all videos for at least 30 calendar days. Additionally, dispensaries must install strategically placed duress and panic alarms, both silent and audible, that trigger a law enforcement response. Employees are also required to wear panic alarm buttons for an additional level of safety and security.
Connecticut Training & Education
All dispensary staff pharmacists must go through a training program on cannabis and cannabis products. Such training must include covering the chemical components of cannabis and use of ancillary cannabis delivery devices. Pharmacist training should prepare pharmacists how to best assess the needs of qualified patients during required new-patient private consultations. During such consultations, pharmacists are required to educate new patients on their qualified debilitating medical condition, allergies, medication profile, cannabis use, and cannabis delivery methods. Pharmacists have sole responsibility to recommend products based on the patients’ individual needs.
Like dispensary staff pharmacists, dispensary technicians and employees also must meet training guidelines as set forth by the CT Program. Dispensary technicians must be trained on professional conduct, ethics, patient confidentiality, and developments in the field of medical cannabis use, among other pertinent topics commensurate with the technician’s professional responsibilities. Dispensary employees, among other things, must be trained on the proper use of security measures and controls, procedures for responding to an emergency, and patient confidentiality. A record of all staff training and patient education must be maintained and made available for review at the request of the DPH.
Connecticut Inspections

For the purposes of supervision and enforcement of the CT Program, the Connecticut Commissioner of Consumer Protection is authorized to (i) enter, at reasonable times, any place, including a vehicle, in which marijuana is held, dispensed, sold, produced, delivered, transported, manufactured or otherwise disposed of, (ii) inspect within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, such place and all pertinent equipment, finished and unfinished material, containers and labeling, and all things in such place, including records, files, financial data, sales data, shipping data, pricing data, employee data, research, papers, processes, controls and facilities, and (iii) inventory any stock of marijuana therein and obtain samples of any marijuana or marijuana product, any labels or containers for marijuana, paraphernalia, and of any finished and unfinished material. 
U.S. Attorney Statements in Connecticut
To the knowledge of management of the Company, there have not been any statements or guidance made by federal authorities or prosecutors regarding the risk of enforcement action in Connecticut.
Illinois
Illinois Legislative history
The Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act (the “IL Medical Act”) was signed into law in August 2013 and took effect on January 1, 2014. The IL Medical Act provides medical cannabis access to registered patients who suffer from a list of over 50 medical conditions including epilepsy, cancer, HIV/AIDS, Chronic pain, Crohn’s disease and post- traumatic stress disorder. On August 12, 2019, changes to the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program became effective.
On June 25, 2019, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed into law the Cannabis Regulation & Tax Act (the “IL Adult Use Act” and, together with the IL Medical Act, the “IL Acts”), which permits persons 21 years of age or older to possess, use, and purchase limited amounts of cannabis for personal use. The IL Adult Use Act went into effect on January 1, 2020.
Illinois Licenses
Oversight and implementation under the Acts are divided among three Illinois state departments: the Department of Public Health (the “IL DPH”), the Department of Agriculture (the “IL DA”), and the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (the “IL DFPR”). The IL DPH oversees the following IL Medical Act mandates: (a) establish and maintain a confidential registry of caregivers and qualifying patients authorized to engage in the medical use of cannabis, (b) distribute educational materials about the health risks associated with the abuse of cannabis and prescription medications, (c) adopt rules to administer the patient and caregiver registration program, and (d) adopt rules establishing food handling requirements for cannabis-infused products that are prepared for human consumption.
It is the responsibility of the IL DA to enforce the provisions of the IL Acts relating to the registration and oversight of cultivation centers and the responsibility of the IL DFPR to enforce the provisions of the IL Acts relating to the registration and oversight of dispensing organizations. The IL DPH, IL DA and IL DFPR may enter into inter-governmental agreements, as necessary, to carry out the provisions of the IL Acts.
Illinois has issued a limited amount of dispensary, producer/grower, and processing licenses. NCC LLC (d/b/a Nature’s Care Company) (“NCC”), an indirect Subsidiary of the Company, was awarded both medical and adult-use cannabis dispensary licenses and In Grown Farms, LLC 2 (“IGF”), an indirect Subsidiary of the Company, was awarded both medical and adult-use cultivation/processing licenses as well as a license to process industrial Hemp. 
Under the IL Adult Use Act, medical cannabis operators have the ability to apply for “early approval” for adult-use licenses. Medical dispensaries are permitted to apply for one adult-use license at its medical dispensary site and one additional early approval license at a secondary site. NCC received an adult-use license on February 3, 2020 for its Rolling Meadows dispensary. On August 30, 2020, NCC received a second license from the IL DFPR for a Registered Adult Use Dispensing Organization. NCC has opened a second adult only dispensary in Chicago. 
The table below lists the licenses issued to the subsidiaries:

Subsidiary | License number | City | Expiration | Description 
NCC LLC | DISP.000024 | Rolling Meadows | 1/22/2023 | Medical Cannabis Dispensary Facility 
NCC LCC | AUDO.000050 | Rolling Meadows | 3/31/2022 | Registered Adult Use Dispensing Organization 
IGF | 1503060729 | Freeport | 3/9/2022 | Medical Cannabis Cultivation/Processing Facility
IGF | 1503060729-EA | Freeport | 3/31/2022 | Early Approval Adult Use Cultivation 
NCC LLC | AUDO.000064 | Chicago | 3/31/2022 | Registered Adult Use Dispensing Organization 
IGF | 1204-321 | Freeport | 12/31/2022 | Industrial Hemp Processor 

Under the IL Medical Act, dispensary, grower, and processing licenses are valid for one year. After the initial term, licensees are required to submit renewal applications. Pursuant to the IL Act, registration renewal applications must be received 45 days prior to expiration and may be denied if the licensee has a history of non-compliance and penalties.
Illinois Dispensing Limitations
Dispensing organizations may not dispense more than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis to qualifying patients, provisional patients, or designated caregivers during a period of 14 days, unless pre-approved by the IL DFPR.
Dispensing limitations for adult-use purchasers are as follows:
•Illinois Residents: 30 grams of flower, 500 mg THC in cannabis infused products, and/or 5 grams of cannabis concentrate.
•Non-Illinois Residents: 15 grams of flower, 250 mg THC in cannabis infused products, and/or 250 milligrams of cannabis concentrate.
Illinois Record-keeping/Reporting
Illinois uses the BioTrack THC T&T system to manage the flow of reported data between each licensee and the state. NCC also uses the T&T system to ensure all reporting requirements are met. Information processed through the T&T system must be maintained in a secure location at the dispensing organization for five years.
Licensees are mandated by the IL Acts to maintain records electronically and make them available for inspection by the IL DFPR upon request. Records that must be maintained and made available, as described in the IL Acts, include: (a) operating procedures, (b) inventory records, policies, and procedures, (c) security records, and (d) staffing plans. All dispensing organization records, including business records such as monetary transactions and bank statements, must be kept for a minimum of three years. Records of destruction and disposal of all cannabis not sold, including notification to the IL DFPR and State Police, must be retained at the dispensary organization for a period of not less than five years.
Illinois Inventory/Storage
The IL Acts have similar requirements regarding inventory tracking and storage. An organization’s agent-in-charge has primary oversight of the dispensing organization’s cannabis inventory control system. Under the IL Acts, a dispensary’s inventory control system must be real-time, web-based, and accessible by the IL DFPR 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The T&T system used by NCC complies with such requirements.
The inventory control system of a dispensing organization must record all cannabis sales, waste, and acquisitions. Specifically, the inventory system must track and reconcile through the T&T system each day’s cannabis beginning inventory, acquisitions, sales, disposal and ending inventory. Tracked information must include (a) product descriptions including the quantity, strain, variety and batch number of each product received, (b) the name and registry identification number of the permitted cultivation center providing the cannabis, (c) the name and registry identification number of the permitted cultivation center agent delivering the cannabis, (d) the name and registry identification number of the dispensing organization agent receiving the cannabis, and (e) the date of acquisition. Dispensary managers are tasked with conducting and documenting monthly audits of the dispensing organization’s daily inventory according to generally accepted accounting principles.
The inventory control system of a cultivator and processing organization must conduct a weekly inventory of cannabis stock, which includes at a minimum, the date of the inventory, a summary of the inventory findings, the name, signature and title of the individuals who conducted the inventory and the agent-in-charge who oversaw the inventory, and the product name and quantity of cannabis plants or cannabis-infused products at the facility. The record of all cannabis sold must include the date of sale, the name of the dispensary facility to which the cannabis was sold and the batch number, product name and quantity of cannabis sold. 
In addition, the T&T permits NCC to set up separate sales reports for (i) sales to qualifying patients and (ii) sales to purchasers, and NCC uses such software to generate separate such reports as is required by the IL Adult Use Act.
Storage of cannabis and cannabis product inventory is also regulated by the IL Acts. Inventory must be stored on the dispensary’s licensed premises in a restricted access area. Appropriate storage temperatures, containers, and lighting are required to ensure the quality and purity of cannabis inventory is not adversely affected.
Illinois Security
Under the IL Acts, dispensaries must implement security measures to deter and prevent entry into and theft from restricted access areas containing either cannabis or currency. Mandated security measures include security systems, panic alarms, and locked doors or barriers between the facility’s entrance and limited access areas. Admission to the limited access areas must be restricted to only purchasers, registered qualifying patients, designated caregivers, principal officers, and agents conducting business with the dispensing organization. Visitors and persons conducting business with the licensee in limited access areas must always wear identification badges and be escorted by a licensee’s agent authorized to enter the restricted access area, and such persons must be pre-approved by the IL DFPR. A visitor’s log must be kept on-site and be maintained for five years. 
The IL Acts provide that 24-hour video surveillance of both a licensee’s interior and exterior are required to be taken and kept for at least 90 days. Unless prohibited by law, video of all interior dispensary areas, including all points of entry and exit, safes, sales areas, and storage areas must be kept. Unobstructed video of the exterior perimeter, including the storefront, grow facility and the parking lot, must also be kept. Video surveillance cameras are required to be angled to allow for facial recognition and the capture of clear and certain identification of any person entering or exiting the dispensary area. Additionally, all video must be taken in lighting sufficient for clear viewing during all times of night or day. The IL Acts also require all security equipment to be inspected and tested within regular 30-day intervals. 
Illinois Transportation
Prior to transporting any cannabis or cannabis-infused product, a cultivation facility must:
•Complete a shipping manifest using a form prescribed by the IL DA; and
•Securely transmit a copy of the manifest to the dispensary facility that will receive the products and to the IL DA before the close of business the day prior to transport. The manifest must be made available to the Illinois State Police upon request. 
The cultivation facility shall maintain all shipping manifests and make them available at the request of the IL DA. 
Cannabis products that are being transported shall:
•Only be transported in a locked, safe and secure storage compartment that is part of the motor vehicle transporting the cannabis, or in a locked storage container that has a separate key or combination pad; and
•Not be visible from outside the motor vehicle.
Any motor vehicle transporting cannabis is required travel directly from the cultivation facility to the dispensary facility, or a testing laboratory, and must not make any stops in between except to other dispensary facilities or laboratories, for refueling or in case of an emergency. A cultivation center shall ensure that all delivery times and routes are randomized. A cultivation center shall staff all transport motor vehicles with a minimum of two employees. At least one delivery team member shall remain with the motor vehicle at all times that the motor vehicle contains cannabis. Each delivery team member shall have access to a secure form of communication with personnel at the cultivation center and the ability to contact law enforcement through the 911 emergency system at all times that the motor vehicle contains cannabis. Each delivery team member shall possess his or her department issued identification card at all times when transporting or delivering cannabis and shall produce it for the IL DA or IL DA’s authorized representative or law enforcement official upon request.
Illinois Inspections
Dispensing organizations are subject to random and unannounced dispensary inspections and cannabis testing by the IL DFPR and Illinois State Police. The IL DFPR and its authorized representatives may enter any place, including a vehicle, in which cannabis is held, stored, dispensed, sold, produced, delivered, transported, manufactured or disposed of and inspect in a reasonable manner, the place and all pertinent equipment, containers and labeling, and all materials, data and processes, and inventory any stock of cannabis and obtain samples of any cannabis or cannabis product, any labels or containers for cannabis, or paraphernalia. 
The IL DFPR may conduct an investigation of an applicant, application, dispensing organization, principal officer, dispensary agent, third party vendor or any other party associated with a dispensing organization for an alleged violation of the IL Acts or to determine qualifications to be granted a registration by the IL DFPR. The IL DFPR may require an applicant or dispensing organization to produce documents, records or any other material pertinent to the investigation of an application or alleged violations of the IL Act.

Cannabis cultivation centers are also subject to random inspections by the IL DA. 
Guarantee of Cannabis and Cannabis-Infused Product Variety
The IL Adult Use Act requires that dispensing organizations maintain inventory from any one supplier representing greater than 40% of the dispensing organization’s total Inventory. NCC monitors inventory offered for sale on a weekly basis and ensure that no single cultivator’s products comprise more than 40% of the inventory offered for sale at NCC. NCC produces a periodic inventory report from BioTrackTHC to determine the inventory percentages of purchases by cultivator. 
The IL Adult Use Act further requires that a dispensing organization have a policy to prioritize serving patients and other medical program participants over purchasers. 
U.S. Attorney Statements in Illinois
To the knowledge of management of the Company, other than as disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have not been any statements or guidance made by federal authorities or prosecutors regarding the risk of enforcement action in Illinois. See “Risk Factors - The Company’s Business Activities are Illegal under U.S. Federal Law”.
Maine
Maine Legislative history
Maine has allowed qualified patients with specific conditions to grow for their own usage and possess limited amounts of medical cannabis since November 1999, but the law lacked any distribution mechanism. On November 3, 2009, Maine voters approved Question 5, which established dispensaries and caregivers are able to grow and dispense up to 2.5 oz. of medical grade cannabis every two weeks to persons with one of 17 debilitating and chronic medical conditions including HIV/AIDS, Crohn’s disease, cancer and post-traumatic stress disorder. The registered dispensaries and caregivers were regulated by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (“MDHHS”), but oversight was recently shifted to the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services (“MDAFS”).
In November 2016, Maine approved cannabis legalization at the ballot. On January 27, 2017, the legislature approved a moratorium on implementing parts of the law regarding retail sales and taxation until at least February 2018, giving time to resolve issues and promulgate rules. The portion of the law that allows persons over 21 years to grow six mature plants and 
possess, transport and gift up to 2.5 ounces became effective on January 30, 2017 (although this was limited to three mature plants in the 2018 legislation). A 17-member special legislative committee was formed to address the complex issues surrounding full implementation of the law. In April 2018, the Governor of Maine vetoed the bill to legalize cannabis for adult-use. However, in May 2018, Maine lawmakers overrode the Governor’s veto clearing the way for adult-use. In February 2019, MDAFS created the Office of Marijuana Policy (“OMP”) to oversee all aspects of adult-use marijuana. The adult-use regulations were adopted in June 2019. Furthermore, a mandatory “opt-in” mechanism allows municipalities to control whether they want retail cannabis establishments in their communities. The State of Maine first made adult-use applications available on December 5, 2019 and the first conditional licenses were issued on March 13, 2020. The OMP intended to launch adult-use in spring 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the postponement of these plans. The first active licenses were issued to adult-use establishments on Tuesday, September 8, 2020. Actively licensed adult-use marijuana stores were able to begin retail sales to the public on or after October 9, 2020. 
Maine Registration Certificates
The Maine Medical Use of Marijuana Program Rules and the enabling statute, the Maine Medical Use of Marijuana Act, govern the Maine Medical Use of Marijuana Program (“MMUMP”). The MDHHS was originally responsible for administering the MMUMP to ensure qualifying patients’ access to safe cannabis for medical use and was responsible for issuing dispensary registration certificates as well as caregiver certificates. The MMUMP through the MDHHS issued eight dispensary registration certificates. However, the MMUMP was transferred to the MDAFS in May 2018, as part of LD 1719, which implemented the adult-use program.
Northeast Patient Group d/b/a Wellness Connection of Maine (“WCM”), a contractual party and debtor of the Company, held four of the eight vertically integrated dispensary certificates of registration. Three out of these four locations in Maine have been converted to adult-use and are owned directly by a subsidiary of Acreage.
The table below lists the certificates issued to WCM and our subsidiary:

MSA Party | Certificate of Registration | City | Expiration Date | Description
WCM | DSP108 | Brewer | 6/15/2022 | Dispensary 


Subsidiary | License number | City | Expiration | Description 
NPG LLC | AMS338 | South Portland | 11/22/2022 | Adult Use Dispensary 
NPG LLC | AMS335 | Gardiner | 4/30/2022 | Adult Use Dispensary 
NPG LLC | MJ-002780-2020 | Portland | 6/15/2022 | Adult Use Dispensary 
NPG LLC | ACD334, AMF330 | Auburn | 10/20/2022 | Cultivation and Manufacturing Facility

The Maine vertically integrated dispensary certificate of registration is valid for one year from the date of issuance. Each certificate of registration for dispensaries allows cultivation, processing and dispensing. WCM cultivates and processes at one centralized location for its three operational dispensaries. The cultivation facility and retail site of a dispensary must comply with all requirements and prohibitions of the Maine statutes and regulations. Failure to comply may result in enforcement action including, but not limited to, termination of the registration certificate. The dispensary must receive both state licensing and municipal approval. The South Portland dispensary location is an adult-use dispensary and operates separately from our managed dispensaries in Maine. 
The dispensary must submit an application for the renewal of a current registration certificate with all required documentation and the required fees 60 days prior to the expiration date. Failure to submit a timely, complete renewal packet may be grounds for denial of the renewal and may result in expiration of the registration certificate to operate the dispensary. Once the application is received and validated, an inspection is scheduled which is conditional for the renewal. The certificate of registration holders must ensure that no cannabis may be sold, delivered, transported or distributed by a producer from or to a location outside of Maine.
Maine Record-keeping/Reporting
Maine does not yet have a unified, mandatory T&T system, although one will be implemented through the development of the adult-use program. However, WCM tracks seed-to-sale via an integrated platform. Required information is forwarded to the MMUMP through email. The operating documents of a registered dispensary must include procedures to ensure accurate record keeping. Registered dispensaries must maintain at least the following: business records, including records of assets and liabilities, tax returns, contracts, monetary transactions, checks, invoices and vouchers which the dispensary keeps as its books of accounts. Business records also include the sales record that indicates the name of the qualifying patient or primary caregiver to whom cannabis has been distributed, sold or donated, including the quantity and form. The registered dispensary must also keep on file and available for MDHHS (now MDAFS) inspection upon request, a copy of each current patient’s registry identification, a copy of the medical provider written certification and the MMUMP approved dispensary designation form. All business records must be available upon request by the MDHHS (now MDAFS) and maintained and retained for six years.
Maine Inventory/Storage
All cultivation facilities for medical use are restricted to cultivating in an enclosed, locked facility or area. Cannabis at a registered dispensary must be kept under double lock and inventoried daily by two cardholders. Each patient’s transactions are recorded and controlled in the POS system to prevent any patient to access more than the allowed limit. WCM monitors inventory daily and reports inventory supply monthly.
Maine Security
Cultivation of cannabis for medical use requires implementation of appropriate security measures to discourage theft of cannabis, ensure safety and prevent unauthorized entrance to a cultivation site in accordance with the MMUMP statute and rules. Requirements include but are not limited to an enclosed, locked facility and enclosed outdoor areas must have durable locks to discourage theft and unauthorized entrance.
Registered dispensaries must implement appropriate security measures to deter and prevent unauthorized entrance into areas containing cannabis and the theft of cannabis at the registered dispensary and the grow location for the cultivation of cannabis. Security measures to protect the premises, the public, qualifying patients, primary caregivers and principal officers, board members and employees of the registered dispensary must include, but are not limited to (a) on-site parking, (b) exterior lighting sufficient to deter nuisance activity and facilitate surveillance, (c) devices or a series of devices, including, but not limited to, a signal system interconnected with a radio frequency method such as cellular, private radio signals, or other mechanical or electronic device to detect an unauthorized intrusion, and (d) interior electronic monitoring, video cameras, and panic buttons. Electronic monitoring and video camera recordings must be maintained by the medical dispensary and cultivation facility a minimum of 14 days. Electronic monitoring and video camera recordings must be maintained by the adult-use dispensary and facility a minimum of 45 days.
Maine Inspections
Registered dispensaries, including all retail and cultivation locations, are subject to inspection at least annually by the MDAFS in accordance with this rule and the statute. Submission of an application for a dispensary registration certificate constitutes permission for entry and inspection of dispensary locations. Failure to cooperate with required inspections may be grounds to revoke the dispensary's registration certificate. During an inspection, the MDAFS may identify violations of this rule, the statute and the dispensary's policies and procedures. The dispensary shall receive written notice of the nature of the violations. The dispensary shall notify the MDAFS in writing with a postmark date within ten business days of the date of the notice of violations and identify the corrective actions taken and the date of the correction. 
During an inspection, the MDAFS shall (1) collect soil and plant samples, and samples of products containing marijuana prepared at the dispensary, (2) place the dispensary's registration number on each sample container, (3) label the sample containers with the description and quantity of its content, (4) seal sample containers, and (5) have dispensary and MDAFS staff initial each sample container. 
U.S. Attorney Statements in Maine
To the knowledge of management of the Company, other than as disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have not been any statements or guidance made by federal authorities or prosecutors regarding the risk of enforcement action in Maine. See “Risk Factors - The Company’s Business Activities are Illegal under U.S. Federal Law”.
Massachusetts
Massachusetts Legislative history
The Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana Program (the “MA Program”) was formed pursuant to the Act for the Humanitarian Medical Use of Marijuana (the “MA ACT”). The MA Program allows registered persons to purchase medical cannabis and applies to any patient, personal caregiver, Medical Marijuana Treatment Center (“MTC”). To qualify for the program, patients must have a debilitating condition as defined by the MA Program. Currently there are over nine conditions that allow a patient to acquire cannabis in Massachusetts, including AIDS/HIV, ALS, cancer and Crohn’s disease. The MA Program is administrated by the Cannabis Control Commission (“CCC”).
In November 2016, Massachusetts voted affirmatively on a ballot petition to legalize and regulate cannabis for adult-use. The Massachusetts legislature amended the law on December 28, 2016, delaying the date adult-use cannabis sales would begin by six months. The delay allowed the legislature to clarify how municipal land-use regulations would treat the cultivation of cannabis and authorized a study of related issues. After further debate, the state House of Representatives and state Senate approved H.3818 which became Chapter 55 of the Acts of 2017, An Act to Ensure Safe Access to Marijuana, and established the CCC. The CCC consists of five commissioners and regulates the Massachusetts Recreational Marijuana Program as well as the MA Program. Adult-use of cannabis in Massachusetts started in July 2018. 
Massachusetts Licenses
Under the MA Program, MTCs are heavily regulated. Vertically integrated MTCs grow, process, and dispense their own cannabis. As such, each MTC is required to have a retail facility as well as cultivation and processing operations, although retail operations may be separate from grow and cultivation operations. A MTC’s cultivation location may be in a different municipality or county than its retail facility. MTC’s are required to be Massachusetts non-profit corporations.
The MA Program mandates a comprehensive application process for MTCs. Each MTC applicant must submit a Certificate of Good Standing, comprehensive financial statements, a character competency assessment, and employment and education histories of the senior partners and individuals responsible for the day-to-day security and operation of the MTC. Municipalities may individually determine what local permits or licenses are required if an MTC wishes to establish an operation within its boundaries.
The table below lists the licenses issued to the subsidiaries and entities operating in Massachusetts with which the Company has a consulting services agreement:

Subsidiary | License Number | City | Expiration Date | Description 
The Botanist, Inc. | RMD-905 | Sterling | 6/5/2022 | MTC Cultivation/Processing 
The Botanist, Inc. | RMD-905 | Worcester | 7/22/2022 | MTC Dispensary 
The Botanist, Inc. | MP281672 | Leominster | 6/23/2022 | RMD - Marijuana Product Manufacturer - Kitchen
The Botanist, Inc. | RMD-1225 | Shrewsbury | 6/6/2022 | RMD Dispensary 

Our Shrewsbury and Worcester locations presently operate as adult-use dispensaries. 
On June 24, 2021 we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a current operator in Massachusetts for the purchase of a dispensary license, an indoor cultivation license and a product manufacturing license, or the Massachusetts Transaction. The Massachusetts transaction is scheduled to close during 2022 pending customary closing conditions. 
Each Massachusetts dispensary, grower and processor license is valid for one year and must be renewed no later than 60 calendar days prior to expiration. As in other states where cannabis is legal, the CCC can deny or revoke licenses and renewals for multiple reasons, including (a) submission of materially inaccurate, incomplete, or fraudulent information, (b) failure to 
comply with any applicable law or regulation, including laws relating to taxes, child support, workers compensation and insurance coverage, (c) failure to submit or implement a plan of correction (d) attempting to assign registration to another entity, (e) insufficient financial resources, (f) committing, permitting, aiding, or abetting of any illegal practices in the operation of the MTC, (g) failure to cooperate or give information to relevant law enforcement related to any matter arising out of conduct at an MTC, and (h) lack of responsible MTC operations, as evidenced by negligence, disorderly or unsanitary facilities or permitting a person to use a registration card belonging to another person. Additionally, license holders must ensure that no cannabis is sold, delivered, or distributed by a producer from or to a location outside of this state.
Massachusetts Dispensary Requirements (Medical)
A MTC is to follow its written and approved operation procedures in the operation of its dispensary locations. Operating procedures shall include (i) security measures in compliance with the MA Program; (ii) employee security policies including personal safety and crime prevention techniques; (iii) hours of operation and after-hours contact information; (iv) a price list for marijuana; (v) storage protocols in compliance with state law; (vi) a description of the various strains of marijuana that will be cultivated and dispensed, and the forms that will be dispensed; (vii) procedures to ensure accurate recordkeeping including inventory protocols; (viii) plans for quality control; (ix) a staffing plan and staffing records; (x) diversion identification and reporting protocols; and (xi) policies and procedures for the handling of cash on MTC premises including storage, collection frequency and transport to financial institutions. The siting of dispensary locations is expressly subject to local/municipal approvals pursuant to state law, and municipalities control the permitting application process that a MTC must comply with. More specifically, a MTC is to comply with all local requirements regarding siting, provided however that if no local requirements exist, a MTC shall not be sited within a radius of 500 feet of a school, daycare center, or any facility in which children commonly congregate. The 500-foot distance under this section is measured in a straight line from the nearest point of the facility in question to the nearest point of the proposed MTC. The MA Program requires that MTCs limit their inventory of seeds, plants, and useable marijuana to reflect the projected needs of registered qualifying patients. A MTC may only dispense to a registered qualifying patient who has a current valid certification.
Massachusetts Record-keeping/Reporting (Medical)
Massachusetts uses METRC as the T&T system. Individual licensees, whether directly or through a third-party application programming interface (an “API”), are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. Each of Health Circle, Inc., Mass Medi-Spa, Inc., Patient Centric Martha’s Vineyard, Ltd. and The Botanist, Inc. use or will use METRC to capture and send all required data points for cultivation, manufacturing, and retail as required by applicable law.
The MA Program requires that MTC records be readily available for inspection by the Department of Health upon request. Among the records that are required to be maintained and made available are: (a) operating procedures, (b) inventory records, and (c) seed-to-sale tracking records for all cannabis and cannabis infused products.
Massachusetts Inventory/Storage (Medical)
Through the T&T system, MTCs are required to record all actions related to each individual cannabis plant. This robust inventorying requirement includes tracking how each plant is handled and processed from seed and cultivation, through growth, harvest and preparation of cannabis infused products, if any, to final sale of finished products. This system must chronicle every step, ingredient, activity, transaction, and dispensary agent, registered qualifying patient, or personal caregiver who handles, obtains, or possesses the product. To meet this tracking requirement, the inventory tracking process is mandated to utilize unique plant and batch identification numbers. Besides capturing all processes associated with each cannabis plant, MTCs must also establish and abide by inventory controls and procedures for conducting inventory reviews and comprehensive inventories of cultivating, finished, and stored cannabis products. To ensure inventories are accurate, MTCs are not only required to conduct monthly inventories but also to compare monthly inventories to the T&T system records.
The MA Program requires all cannabis and cannabis infused products be securely stored. MTCs must ensure that all safes, vaults, and other equipment or areas used for the production, cultivation, harvesting, processing, or storage of cannabis and cannabis infused products are securely locked and protected against unauthorized entry. The MA Program also specifies that limited access areas, accessible only to authorized personnel, must be established in each dispensary. Furthermore, only the minimum number of employees essential to business operations may be given access to the limited access areas.
Massachusetts Security (Medical)
Adequate security systems that prevent and detect diversion, theft, or loss of cannabis are required of each MTC under the MA Program. Such security systems must utilize commercial grade equipment and are required to include (a) a perimeter alarm on all entry and exit points and perimeter windows, (b) a failure notification system that provides an audible, text, or visual notification of any failure in the surveillance system, and (c) a duress alarm, panic alarm, or holdup alarm connected to local public safety or law enforcement authorities.
To ensure MTCs meet the rigorous security standards laid out by the MA Program, use of surveillance cameras is mandated. MTCs must install video cameras in the following areas: (a) all areas that may contain cannabis, (b) all points of entry and exit, and (c) in any parking lot. Video cameras must be appropriate for the lighting conditions of the area under surveillance. Interior video cameras must be directed at all safes, vaults, sales areas, and areas where cannabis is cultivated, harvested, processed, prepared, stored, handled, or dispensed. Video surveillance is required to be operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week and all recordings must be retained for at least 90 calendar days.
Massachusetts Transportation (Medical)
The MA Program regulates the means and methods by which cannabis is transported. A MTC transporting cannabis must ensure the product is in a secure, locked storage compartment. If a cannabis establishment, pursuant to a cannabis transporter license is transporting cannabis products for more than one cannabis establishment at a time, the cannabis products for each cannabis establishment must be kept in separate locked storage compartments during transportation and separate manifests are required for each cannabis establishment. Vehicles transporting cannabis must be equipped with an approved alarm system and functioning heating and air conditioning systems appropriate for maintaining correct temperatures for storage of cannabis products. Additionally, cannabis products may not be visible from outside the vehicle and MTCs must ensure that all transportation times and routes are randomized. Cannabis and cannabis infused products may not be transported outside Massachusetts.
Massachusetts CCC Inspections (Medical)
The CCC or its agents may inspect a MTC and affiliated vehicles at any time without prior notice. A MTC shall immediately upon request make available to the CCC information that may be relevant to a CCC inspection, and the CCC may direct a MTC to test marijuana for contaminants. Any violations found will be noted in a deficiency statement that will be provided to the MTC, and the MTC shall thereafter submit a Plan of Correction to the CCC outlining with particularity each deficiency and the timetable and steps to remediate the same. The CCC shall have the authority to suspend or revoke a certificate of registration in accordance with 935 CMR 501.510 of the Regulation of adult-use cannabis in Massachusetts.
Regulation of the Adult Use Cannabis Market in Massachusetts
Adult-use (recreational) marijuana has been legal in Massachusetts since December 15, 2016, following a ballot initiative in November of that year. The CCC, a regulatory body created in 2018, licenses adult-use cultivation, processing and dispensary facilities (collectively, “Marijuana Establishments”) pursuant to 935 CMR 500.000 et seq. The first adult-use marijuana facilities in Massachusetts began operating in November 2018.
Massachusetts Licensing Requirements (Adult-Use)
Many of the same application requirements exist for a Marijuana Establishment license as a MTC application, and each owner, officer or member must undergo background checks and fingerprinting with the CCC. Applicants must submit the location and identification of each site, and must establish a property interest in the same, and the applicant and the local municipality must have entered into a host agreement authorizing the location of the adult-use Marijuana Establishment within the municipality, and said agreement must be included in the application. Applicants must include disclosure of any regulatory actions against it by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as well as the civil and criminal history of the applicant and its owners, officers, principals or members. The application must include the MTC applicant’s plans for separating medical and adult-use operations, proposed timeline for achieving operations, liability insurance, business plan, and a detailed summary describing and/or updating or modifying the MTC’s existing medical marijuana operating policies and procedures for adult-use including security, prevention of diversion, storage, transportation, inventory procedures, quality control, dispensing procedures, personnel policies, record keeping, maintenance of financial records and employee training protocols.
No person or entity may own more than 10% or “control” more than three licenses in each Marijuana Establishment class (i.e., marijuana retailer, marijuana cultivator, marijuana product manufacturer). Additionally, there is a 100,000 square foot cultivation canopy for adult-use licenses; however, there is no canopy restriction for MTC license holders relative to their cultivation facility.
Massachusetts Dispensary Requirements (Adult-Use)
Marijuana retailers are subject to certain operational requirements in addition to those imposed on marijuana establishments generally. Dispensaries must immediately inspect patrons’ identification to ensure that everyone who enters is at least twenty-one years of age. Dispensaries may not dispense more than one ounce of marijuana or five grams of marijuana concentrate per transaction. Point-of-sale systems must be approved by the CCC, and retailers must record sales data. Records must be retained and available for auditing by the CCC and Department of Revenue. Dispensaries must also make patient education materials available to patrons. Such materials must include:
•A warning that marijuana has not been analyzed or approved by the FDA, that there is limited information on side effects, that there may be health risks associated with using marijuana, and that it should be kept away from children;
•A warning that when under the influence of marijuana, driving is prohibited by M.G.L. c. 90, § 24, and machinery should not be operated;
•Information to assist in the selection of marijuana, describing the potential differing effects of various strains of marijuana, as well as various forms and routes of administration;
•Materials offered to consumers to enable them to track the strains used and their associated effects;
•Information describing proper dosage and titration for different routes of administration, with an emphasis on using the smallest amount possible to achieve the desired effect;
•A discussion of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal;
•Facts regarding substance abuse signs and symptoms, as well as referral information for substance abuse treatment programs;
•A statement that consumers may not sell marijuana to any other individual;
•Information regarding penalties for possession or distribution of marijuana in violation of Massachusetts law; and
•Any other information required by the CCC.
Massachusetts Security and Storage Requirements (Adult-Use)

Massachusetts Transportation Requirements (Adult-Use)
Marijuana products may only be transported between licensed marijuana establishments by registered marijuana establishment agents. A licensed marijuana transporter may contract with a licensed marijuana establishment to transport that licensee's marijuana products to other licensed establishments. The originating and receiving licensed establishments shall ensure that all transported marijuana products are linked to the seed-to-sale tracking program. For the purposes of tracking, seeds and clones will be properly tracked and labeled in a form and manner determined by the CCC. Any marijuana product that is undeliverable or is refused by the destination marijuana establishment shall be transported back to the originating establishment. All vehicles transporting marijuana products shall be staffed with a minimum of two marijuana establishment agents. At least one agent shall remain with the vehicle at all times that the vehicle contains marijuana or marijuana products. Prior to the products leaving a marijuana establishment for the purpose of transporting marijuana products, the originating marijuana establishment must weigh, inventory, and account for, on video, all marijuana products to be transported. Within eight hours after arrival at the destination marijuana establishment, the destination establishment must re-weigh, re-inventory, and account for, on video, all marijuana products transported. When videotaping the weighing, inventorying, and accounting of marijuana products before transportation or after receipt, the video must show each product being weighed, the weight, and the manifest. Marijuana products must be packaged in sealed, labeled, and tamper or child-resistant packaging prior to and during transportation. In the case of an emergency stop during the transportation of marijuana products, a log must be maintained describing the reason for the stop, the duration, the location, and any activities of personnel exiting the vehicle. A marijuana establishment or a marijuana transporter transporting marijuana products is required to ensure that all transportation times and routes are randomized. An establishment or transporter transporting marijuana products shall ensure that all transport routes remain within Massachusetts. All vehicles and transportation equipment used in the transportation of cannabis products or edibles requiring temperature control for safety must be designed, maintained, and equipped as necessary to provide adequate temperature control to prevent the cannabis products or edibles from becoming unsafe during transportation, consistent with applicable requirements pursuant to 21 CFR 1.908(c).
Vehicles used for transport must be owned or leased by the marijuana establishment or transporter, and they must be properly registered, inspected, and insured in Massachusetts. Marijuana may not be visible from outside the vehicle, and it must be transported in a secure, locked storage compartment. Each vehicle must have a global positioning system, and any agent transporting marijuana must have access to a secure form of communication with the originating location.
Massachusetts CCC Inspections
The CCC or its agents may inspect a marijuana establishment and affiliated vehicles at any time without prior notice in order to determine compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. All areas of a marijuana establishment, all marijuana establishment agents and activities, and all records are subject to such inspection. Marijuana establishments must immediately upon request make available to the Commission all information that may be relevant to a CCC inspection, or an investigation of any incident or complaint. A marijuana establishment must make all reasonable efforts to facilitate the CCC's inspection, or 
investigation of any incident or complaint, including the taking of samples, photographs, video or other recordings by the CCC or its agents, and to facilitate the CCC's interviews of marijuana establishment agents. During an inspection, the CCC may direct a Marijuana Establishment to test marijuana for contaminants as specified by the CCC, including but not limited to mold, mildew, heavy metals, plant-growth regulators, and the presence of pesticides not approved for use on marijuana by the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources.
Moreover, the CCC is authorized to conduct a secret shopper program to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
U.S. Attorney Statements in Massachusetts
On July 10, 2018, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, Andrew Lelling, issued a statement regarding the legalization of adult-use marijuana in Massachusetts. Mr. Lelling stated that since he has a constitutional obligation to enforce the laws passed by Congress, he would not immunize the residents of Massachusetts from federal law enforcement. He did state, however, that his office’s resources would be primarily focused on combating the opioid epidemic. He stated that considering those factors and the experiences of other states that have legalized adult-use marijuana, his office’s enforcement efforts would focus on the areas of (i) overproduction, (ii) targeted sales to minors and (iii) organized crime and interstate transportation of drug proceeds. 
To the knowledge of management of the Company, other than as disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have not been any statements or guidance made by federal authorities or prosecutors regarding the risk of enforcement action in Massachusetts. See “Risk Factors - The Company’s Business Activities are Illegal under U.S. Federal Law.”
New Jersey
New Jersey Legislative history
On January 18, 2010, the governor of New Jersey signed into law S.119, the Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act (the “NJ Act”), permitting the use of medical cannabis for persons with debilitating conditions including cancer, HIV/AIDS, ALS, Crohn’s disease and any terminal illness. The law permits the New Jersey Department of Health (“NJDH”) to create rules to add other illnesses to the permitted conditions. The NJ Law does not permit patients to grow their own cannabis but rather mandates that cannabis must be acquired through ATCs licensed by the State.
Caregivers for patients are permitted to collect cannabis on behalf of the patient. Under the NJ Act, six ATCs received licenses from the State. The ATCs are non-profit entities and have the exclusive right to produce and sell medical cannabis in New Jersey.
On March 27, 2018 through executive order No. 6 (2018), Governor Phil Murphy expanded the medical cannabis program, announcing the 20-plus recommendations presented by the NJDH on March 23, 2018. The NJDH’s recommendations and next steps included certain measures that took effect immediately (e.g. the addition of debilitating conditions and the reduction of registration fees) and other recommendations (e.g. the home delivery model) that require further regulatory or statutory enactment.
In February 2019, the NJDH amended the list of debilitating conditions to include opioid use disorder, which had been accepted as petition by the review panel. The NJDH also implemented measures to streamline the enrollment process for patients, allow physicians to opt out of being listed publicly, and have started the permitting process for six new ATCs. 
In the 2020 general election, New Jersey residents voted two-to-one in favor of recreational cannabis legalization. The state has to pass legalization and decriminalization bills, which will then get signed into law by Governor Phil Murphy. Once that happens, the state’s Cannabis Regulatory Commission (CRC) will be fully appointed, and that five-person body must issue regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of the law for every part of the industry — from growing to distribution.
New Jersey Licenses
The NJDH is responsible for administering the NJ Act to ensure qualifying patients’ access to safe cannabis for medical use in New Jersey. The NJDH is responsible for issuing permits to entities who will operate an ATC. New Jersey is a vertical state where the dispensary needs to be in the same location as the growing and processing facilities. One of the recommendations in executive order No. 6 is to allow existing license holders to have up to two additional dispensaries not attached to the growing facility. The NJDH has issued twelve permits. The NJDH previously accepted applications for an additional six vertical permits. The NJDH is seeking new applicants to operate up to 24 additional Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs): Up to 8 in 
the northern region of the state, up to 8 in the central region, up to 7 in the southern region, and up to 1 “at-large” to be determined during the award process.
ATC permits expire annually on December 31. A permit renewal application must be submitted at least 60 days prior to the expiration date. An ATC that seeks to renew its permit shall submit to the permitting authority an application for renewal with all required documentation and the required fees. An ATC shall update and ensure the correctness of all information submitted in previous applications for a permit or otherwise on file with the NJDH. Prior to the issuance of any permit, every principal officer, owner, director and board member of an ATC must certify stating that he or she submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New Jersey and agrees to comply with all the requirements of the laws of New Jersey pertaining to New Jersey’s Medicinal Marijuana Program. Failure to provide correct and current up-to-date information is grounds for denial of the application for renewal of the permit.
On August 19, 2021, the CRC adopted its initial rules for adult use of cannabis in New Jersey, which are effective for one year ending on August 19, 2022. The rules focus on the application process and the requirements for owning and operating a cannabis business. Additional rules will be fleshed out through the normal regulatory rule making process during 2022.
Acreage CCF New Jersey, LLC (“CCF”) is a vertically integrated medical cannabis operator in New Jersey with licenses to conduct growing, processing, wholesale, and dispensary operations.in Egg Harbor, New Jersey. On October 4, 2013, the New Jersey Department of Health issued CCF a license to operate its facilities. The license has been renewed without issue. On June 26, 2020 we closed on the purchase of CCF and it is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary.
The table below lists the permit issued to CCF:

MSA Party | Permit Number | City | Expiration Date | Description 
CCF | 10042013 | Egg Harbor | 12/31/2022 | Cultivate and Dispense
CCF | 10042013 | Atlantic City | 12/31/2022 | Dispense 
CCF | 10042013 | Williamstown | 12/31/2022 | Dispense 

New Jersey Record-keeping/Reporting
New Jersey does not have a unified T&T system. All information is forwarded to the MMMP through email. The ATC collects and submits to the NJDH for each calendar year statistical data on (a) the number of registered qualified patients and registered primary caregivers, (b) the debilitating medical conditions of the qualified patients, (c) patient demographic data, (d) summary of the patient surveys and evaluation of services and (e) other information as the NJDH may require. The ATC must retain records for at least two years.
New Jersey Inventory/Storage
The ATC will establish inventory controls and procedures for the conduct of inventory reviews and comprehensive inventories of cultivating, stored, usable and unusable cannabis. The ATC will conduct a monthly inventory of cultivating, stored, usable and unusable cannabis. Through a unified T&T system is not currently in place, an ATC is required to have a T&T system for tracking inventory and dispensing cannabis products to patients. CCF uses BioTrackTHC as its T&T system. An ATC is authorized to possess two ounces of usable cannabis per registered qualifying patient plus an additional supply, not to exceed the amount needed to enable the alternative treatment center to meet the demand of newly registered qualifying patients.
Per regulatory requirements an ATC, at a minimum, must (a) establish inventory controls and procedures for the conduct of inventory reviews and comprehensive inventories of cultivating, stored, usable and unusable cannabis, (b) conduct a monthly inventory of cultivating, stored, usable and unusable cannabis, (c) perform a comprehensive inventory inspection at least once every year from the date of the previous comprehensive inventory, and (d) promptly transcribe inventories taken by use of an oral recording device. If cannabis is disposed of, the ATC must maintain a written record of the date, the quantity disposed of, the manner of disposal and the persons present during the disposal, with their signatures. ATCs must keep disposal records for at least two years. Results of the inventory inspection should document the date of the inventory review, a summary of the inventory findings and the name, signature and title of the individuals who conducted the inventory inspection.
An ATC shall limit access to medicinal cannabis storage areas to the absolute minimum number of specifically authorized employees. In the event non-employee maintenance personnel, business guests or visitors to be present in or pass through medical cannabis storage areas, the ATC must have a dedicated person who is specifically authorized by policy or job description to supervise the activity. The ATC must ensure that the storage of usable cannabis prepared for dispensing to patients is in a locked area with adequate security.
New Jersey Security
An ATC is required to implement effective controls and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of cannabis including systems to protect against electronic records tampering. At a minimum, every ATC must (a) install, maintain in good working order and operate a safety and security alarm system that provides suitable protection 24 hours a day, seven days a week against theft and diversion, (b) immediately notify the state or local police agencies of an unauthorized breach of security. An ATC must conduct maintenance inspections and tests of the security alarm system at intervals not to exceed 30 days from the previous inspection.
A video surveillance system must be installed and operated to clearly monitor all critical control activities of the ATC and must operate in good working order at all times. The ATC must provide two monitors for remote viewing via telephone lines to the NJDH offices. This security system must be approved by State of New Jersey’s Medicinal Marijuana Program prior to permit issuance. The original tapes or digital pictures produced by the system must be stored in a safe place for a minimum of 30 days.
New Jersey Transportation
An ATC that is authorized by permit to cultivate medicinal marijuana at one location and to dispense it at a second location shall transport only usable marijuana from the cultivation site to the dispensing site according to a delivery plan submitted to the Department. Each vehicle must be staffed with at least two registered ATC employees. At least one delivery team member shall remain with the vehicle at all times that the vehicle contains medicinal marijuana. Each delivery team member shall have access to a secure form of communication with the ATC, such as a cellular telephone, at all times that the vehicle contains medicinal marijuana. Each delivery team member must possess their ATC employee identification card at all times and shall produce it to NJDH staff or law enforcement officials upon demand. 
Each transport vehicle needs to be equipped with a secure lockbox or locking cargo area, which shall be used for the sanitary and secure transport of medicinal marijuana. Each ATC must maintain current commercial automobile liability insurance on each vehicle used for transport of medicinal marijuana in the amount of one million dollars per incident. Each ATC must ensure that vehicles used to transport medicinal marijuana bear no markings that would either identify or indicate that the vehicle is used to transport medicinal marijuana, and each trip must be completed in a timely and efficient manner, without intervening stops or delays. Each ATC shall maintain a record of each transport of medicinal marijuana in a transport logbook, which must include dates and times of trips, names of employees on the delivery team, relevant facts about the products transported and the signatures of the delivery team. 
ATCs must report any vehicle accidents, diversions, losses, or other reportable events that occur during transport to the permitting authority in accordance with New Jersey law. 
Home delivery is not permitted under New Jersey law. An ATC may not deliver marijuana to the home or residence of a registered qualifying patient or primary caregiver. 
New Jersey Inspections
An ATC is subject to onsite assessment by the NJDH at any time. The NJDH may enter an ATC without notice to carry out an onsite assessment in accordance New Jersey laws and regulations. All ATCs are required to provide the NJDH or the NJDH’s designee immediate access to any material and information so requested. Submission of an application for an ATC permit constitutes permission for entry and onsite assessment of an ATC, and failure to cooperate with an onsite assessment and or to provide the NJDH access to the premises or information may be grounds to revoke the permit of the ATC and to refer the matter to state law enforcement agencies. 
An onsite assessment may include (1) the review of all ATC documents and records and conferences with qualifying patients and primary caregivers and other persons with information, and the making and retaining of copies and/or extracts, (2) the use of any computer system at the ATC to examine electronic data, (3) the reproduction and retention of any document and/or electronic data in the form of a printout or other output, (4) the examination and collection of samples of any marijuana found at the ATC, and (5) the seizure and detention of any marijuana or thing believed to contain marijuana found at the ATC. 
U.S. Attorney Statements in New Jersey
To the knowledge of management of the Company, other than as disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have not been any statements or guidance made by federal authorities or prosecutors regarding the risk of enforcement action in New Jersey. See “Risk Factors - The Company’s Business Activities are Illegal under U.S. Federal Law”.
New York
New York Legislative history
In July 2014, the New York Legislature and Governor enacted the Compassionate Care Act (the “CCA”) to provide a comprehensive, safe and effective medical cannabis program. The CCA bill which is part of the Title V-A in Article 33, Title 10, Chapter 13 of the Public Health Law is scheduled to sunset in seven (7) years, in 2021. The CCA provides access to the program to those who suffer from one of 31 qualifying serious conditions including, debilitating or life-threatening conditions including cancer, HIV/AIDS, ALS and chronic pain. Patients must also have one of the following associated or complicating conditions: cachexia or wasting syndrome, severe or chronic pain, severe nausea, seizures, or severe or persistent muscle spasms.
Pursuant to the CCA, only a limited number of product offerings are allowed including metered liquid or oil preparations, solid and semi-solid preparations (e.g. capsules, chewable and effervescent tablets), metered ground plant preparations, and topical forms and transdermal patches. Medical cannabis may not be incorporated into the food products unless approved by the Commissioner of Health and smoking of cannabis flower is prohibited.
On March 31, 2021, New York approved the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act (the “MRTA”) into law, legalizing adult-use cannabis in the state and establishing a regulatory framework. Regulatory oversight of medical cannabis is planned to be transferred to Office of Cannabis Management and the CCA to be repealed and replaced by MRTA’s medical provisions.

License holders must ensure that no cannabis is sold, delivered, transported or distributed by a producer from or to a location outside of New York. 
New York Record-keeping/Reporting
The NYDOH uses the BioTrack THC T&T system used to track commercial cannabis activity. NYCANNA also uses BioTrack THC to push the data to the NYDOH to meet all reporting requirements. Each month, each registered organization is required to file reports with the NYDOH which provides information showing all products dispensed during the month. All other data shall be pulled from the T&T system. The data must include (a) documentation, including lot numbers where applicable, of all materials used in the manufacturing of the approved medical cannabis product to allow tracking of the materials including but 
not limited to soil, soil amendment, nutrients, hydroponic materials, fertilizers, growth promoters, pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides, (b) cultivation, manufacturing, packaging and labeling production records, and (c) laboratory testing results. The records are required to be maintained for a period of five years.
New York Inventory/Storage

The manufacturing and dispensing facilities must direct cameras at all approved safes, approved vaults, dispensing areas, cannabis sales areas and any other area where cannabis is manufactured, stored, handled, dispensed or disposed of. The manufacturing and dispensing facilities must angle the cameras to allow for the capture of clear and certain identification of any person entering or exiting the facilities. The surveillance cameras must record 24 hours, seven days a week. Recordings from all video cameras must be readily available for immediate viewing by a state authorized representative upon request and must be retained for at least 90 days. A registered organization must test the security and surveillance equipment no less than semi-annually at each manufacturing and dispensing facility that is operated under the registered organization’s registration. Records of security tests must be maintained for five years.

Ohio
Ohio Legislative History
Effective September 8, 2016, House Bill 523 legalized the use of medical cannabis for 21 debilitating conditions as prescribed by a licensed physician. On implementation, the Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program (“OMMCP”) will allow people with certain medical conditions including Alzheimer’s disease, HIV/AIDS, ALS, cancer, and traumatic brain injury to legally purchase medical cannabis. On July 8, 2020 Ohio Medical Board added Cachexia to the list of qualifying conditions. Though Ohio was required to implement a fully operational OMMCP by September 8, 2018 with a controlled system for cultivation, laboratory-testing, physician/patient registration and dispensing, the timeline was delayed until November 2018. Regulatory oversight is shared between three offices; (a) the Ohio Department of Commerce with respect to overseeing cultivators, processors and testing laboratories; (b) the Ohio Board of Pharmacy with respect to overseeing retail dispensaries and the registration of patients and caregivers, and (c) the State Medical Board of Ohio with respect to certifying physicians to recommend medical cannabis. The OMMCP will permit limited product types including oils, tinctures, plant materials and edibles. Adult-use and the smoking of cannabis flower are prohibited. 
Ohio Licenses
Prior to September 8, 2018, the Ohio Board of Pharmacy was permitted to issue up to 60 dispensary provisional licenses. After September 8, 2018, additional provisional licenses are permitted to be issued if the population, the number of patients seeking to use medical cannabis products and the availability of all forms of cannabis products support additional licenses. To be considered for approval of a provisional dispensary or a processing license, the applicant must complete all mandated requirements. To obtain a certificate of operation for a medical cannabis dispensary or processing facility, the prospective licensee must be capable of operating in accordance with Chapter 3796 of the Revised Code, the Medical Marijuana Control Program. Dispensary Certificates of operation carry two-year terms, while certificates of operation for cultivators and processors must be renewed annually. 
A certificate of operation will expire on the date identified on the certificate. A licensee will receive written or electronic notice 90 days before the expiration of its certificate of operation. The licensee must submit the renewal information at least 45 days prior to the date the existing certificate expires. The information required for the license renewal includes, but is not limited to, the following: (a) a roster that includes the dispensary’s employees’ names, (b) the history of compliance with regulations, and (c) the number and severity of any violations. If a licensee’s renewal application is not filed prior to the expiration date of the certificate of operation, the certificate of operation will be suspended for a maximum of 30 days. After 30 days, if the dispensary has not successfully renewed the certificate of operation, including the payment of all applicable fees, the certificate of operations will be deemed expired. The original implementation deadline of September 8, 2018 was missed by Ohio, as noted above. Starting in January 2019, Ohio patients were able to purchase medical cannabis.
Greenleaf Apothecaries, LLC (“GLA”) has been issued five dispensary licenses and Greenleaf Therapeutics, LLC (“GLT”) has been issued one provisional processing license. Greenleaf Gardens, LLC (“GLG”) has been issued one provisional grow license. The table below lists the locations of the licenses.

Oregon
Oregon Legislative History
Oregon has both a medical and adult-use cannabis program. The Oregon Medical Marijuana Act (“OMM”) was established by Oregon Ballot Measure 67 in 1998 to allow for the cultivation, possession and use of cannabis by patients upon doctor recommendation. The OMM removed criminal penalties for medical cannabis for patients with debilitating medical conditions whose doctor verified the condition and determined medical cannabis may alleviate the condition. Qualifying conditions include cancer, chronic pain, glaucoma and HIV/AIDS. The Oregon Medical Marijuana Program (“OMMP”) administers the program within the Oregon Department of Human Services. Patients obtain permits through the Oregon Department of Human Services.
In 2014, Measure 91 was approved which legalized non-medical cultivation and uses of cannabis effective July 1, 2015. Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed an emergency bill declaring cannabis sales legal to adult-use users from commercial dispensaries 
effective October 1, 2015. Effective January 1, 2017, cannabis was permitted to be sold for adult-use only by businesses that obtained a recreational retailer license from the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (“OLCC”). Medical cannabis dispensaries that did not obtain a retailer license were no longer permitted to sell cannabis for adult-use after 2016. Holders of retailer licenses are permitted to sell cannabis for medical use to an OMMP patient 18 years of age or older whereas the minimum age to purchase cannabis for adult-use is 21.
Oregon Licenses
Oregon does not limit the number of retailer, grower or processing licenses The OLCC regulates all retailer, producer, processor and lab license holders who have been approved to hold adult-use licenses and all producers and retailers if they sell both medical and adult-use cannabis. The Oregon Health Administration regulates all growers and dispensaries who hold only medical licenses. To operate legally under state law, cannabis operators must obtain a state license and local approval. Applicants for each license class are subject to the respective requirements and criteria of the OLCC which include but are not limited to criminal background checks, zoning requirements, readiness inspection, and state registration.

Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania Legislative History
The Pennsylvania Medical Marijuana Program (the “PA Program”) was established by the Pennsylvania Medical Marijuana Act (the “PA Act”) on April 17, 2016. The PA Program provides access to medical cannabis for qualified state residents who suffer from 23 specific medical conditions including epilepsy, chronic pain, HIV, AIDS, cancer, and post-traumatic stress disorder. To qualify under the PA Program, medical cannabis patients must both register with the Pennsylvania Department of Health (the “PADOH”) and obtain either an identification card or authorization letter from the PADOH. On February 15, 2018, dispensaries licensed under the PA Program began selling medical cannabis to qualified patients. Pennsylvania currently allows sale of medical cannabis to qualified patients in the following forms: pill, oil, topical forms including gels, creams, or ointments, tincture, and liquids. On August 1, 2018, the Pennsylvania Health Secretary approved the sale of dry leaf cannabis.
Pennsylvania Permits
The PA Act allows the PADOH to issue up to 25 grower/processor permits and 50 dispensary permits (each dispensary permit allows the holder to open up to three separate dispensary sites). On June 29, 2017, the PADOH issued 12 cultivation/processing permits and 27 dispensary permits. Permits are granted to applicants who demonstrate, among other things: (a) the ability to implement and maintain effective security measures and controls to prevent diversion, (b) a clear criminal background free of illegal conduct, (c) compliance with municipality zoning requirements, (d) well-defined standard operating procedures, and (e) a verified diversity plan. Prior to awarding permits, the PA Program requires the PADOH to verify all applicant information including through interviews of principals, operators, financial backers, and employees engaged and to be engaged in the permit applicant’s cannabis operations.
The table below lists the permit issued to Prime Wellness of Pennsylvania LLC (“PWPA”), an indirect Subsidiary of the Company. 

Subsidiary | Permit | City | Expiration Date | Description 
Prime Wellness of Pennsylvania LLC | GP- 1005-17 | Sinking Spring | 6/20/2022 | Grow/Processing Facility

Dispensary, grower, and processing permits are valid for one year from the date of issuance and permit holders are required to submit renewal applications in accordance with the PA Act. The PADOH must renew a permit unless it determines the applicant is unlikely to maintain effective control against diversion of medical cannabis and the applicant is unlikely to comply with all laws as prescribed under the PA Act. Additionally, permit holders must ensure that no cannabis is sold, delivered, transported, or distributed outside of Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania Record keeping/Reporting
The PA Act requires each licensed medical cannabis grower/processor or dispensary to report information to the PADOH every three months including, but not limited to, (a) the amount of medical cannabis sold by the grower/processor, (b) the total value and amounts of medical cannabis sold by the grower/processor, (c) the amount of medical cannabis purchased by each dispensary, (d) the cost and amounts of medical cannabis sold to each dispensary, and (e) the total amount and dollar value of medical cannabis sold by each dispensary.
To monitor reporting requirements under the PA Act, the PADOH selected MJ Freeway as the T&T system to implement a seed-to-sale electronic tracking. PWPA also uses MJ Freeway to push data and ensure compliance with all reporting requirements.
Pennsylvania Inventory/Storage
The PA Act requires each medical cannabis grower/processor maintains inventory and storage data in an electronic format through MJ Freeway. The following information is tracked to ensure a compliant cannabis business operation: (a) the number, weight, and type of seeds used, (b) the number of immature medical cannabis plants, (c) the number of mature medical cannabis plants, (d) the number of medical cannabis products ready for sale, and (d) the number of damaged, defective, expired, or contaminated seeds, immature medical cannabis plants, medical cannabis plants and medical cannabis products awaiting disposal.
Robust physical inventory controls and procedures are required of each medical cannabis grower/processor under the PA Act. The following procedures are mandated to ensure physical inventory counts match electronic records: (a) monthly inventory counts of both medical cannabis plants in the process of growing and medical cannabis products that are stored for future sale, 
(b) comprehensive inventory counts of seeds, immature medical cannabis plants and medical cannabis plants, and (c) written or electronic records created and maintained for each inventory count conducted.
Additionally, each medical cannabis grower/processor must separately store in locked, limited access areas all seeds, immature medical cannabis plants, medical cannabis plants and medical cannabis that is expired, damaged, deteriorated, mislabeled or contaminated.
Pennsylvania Security
The PA Act mandates each medical cannabis grower/processor must use security and surveillance systems including stringent video backup requirements to safeguard their medical cannabis and related products. Security requirements include: (a) alarm systems that cover all facility entrances, exits, areas that contain medical cannabis, safes, and the perimeter of the facility, and (b) professionally-monitored security and surveillance systems that operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and record all activity in images capable of clearly revealing facial detail. All images captured by each surveillance camera must be stored for a minimum of two (2) years in a format that may be easily accessed for investigative purposes. Furthermore, all recordings must be kept in a locked cabinet, closet or other secure place to protect them from tampering or theft.
The PA Act also specifies requirements for the alarm system. The alarm system must include: (a) a silent security alarm signal, (b) an audible security alarm signal generated by the manual activation of a device intended to signal a life-threatening or emergency situation requiring law enforcement response, and (c) an electrical, electronic, mechanical, or other device capable of being programmed to send a pre-recorded voice message requesting dispatch, when activated, over a telephone line, radio, or other communication system to a law enforcement, public safety, or emergency services agency.
Pennsylvania Transportation
A medical cannabis grower/processor must transport and deliver medical cannabis to a medical cannabis organization or an approved laboratory within Pennsylvania in accordance with the following: (a) deliveries must be made between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m., (b) a global positioning system must be used to ensure safe and efficient delivery, (c) medical cannabis may not be visible from outside of the transport vehicle, (d) vehicles must be equipped with a secure cargo area, (e) each transport vehicle must be staffed with at least two individuals and at least one delivery team member must remain with the medical cannabis at all times, and (f) a printed or electronic transport manifest must accompany every delivery.
Pennsylvania Inspections
The PADOH may conduct announced or unannounced inspections or investigations to determine the medical marijuana organization’s compliance with its license and Pennsylvania laws and regulations. During an inspection or investigation, the PADOH may review the site, facility, vehicles, books, records, papers, documents, data, and other physical or electronic information. The PADOH may also question employees, officers, investors or similar persons and any other person or entity providing services to the medical marijuana organization. 
The PADOH may also conduct an inspection of a grower/processor facility’s equipment, instruments, tools and machinery that are used to grow, process and package medical marijuana, including containers and labels. The PADOH and its authorized agents will have free access to review and, if necessary, make copies of books, records, papers, documents, data, or other physical or electronic information that relates to the business of the medical marijuana organization, including financial data, sales data, shipping data, pricing data and employee data. 
The PADOH and its authorized agents have the right to access any area within a site or facility and are permitted to collect test samples for testing at an approved laboratory.
Failure of a medical marijuana organization to provide the PADOH and its authorized agents immediate access to any part of a medical marijuana organization’s site or facility, requested material, physical or electronic information, or individual as part of an inspection or investigation may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty, suspension or revocation of its permit, or an immediate cessation of operations pursuant to a cease and desist order issued by the PADOH.
