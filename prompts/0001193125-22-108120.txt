Description of Business 
 Product Overview 
 We leverage our expertise in data visualization technologies to design, manufacture and market specialty printing systems, test and measurement systems, and related services for select growing markets globally. 
 Product Identification products sold under the QuickLabel, TrojanLabel and GetLabels brands are used in brand owner and commercial applications to provide product packaging, marketing, tracking, branding, and 
 
3 

  labeling solutions to a wide array of industries. The PI segment offers a variety of digital color label tabletop printers, direct-to-package printers, high-volume presses and specialty OEM printing systems, as well as a wide range of label, tag and flexible packaging material substrates and other supplies, including ink and toner, allowing customers to mark, track, protect and enhance the appearance of their products. In the T&M segment, we have a long history of using our technologies to provide networking systems and high-resolution light-weight flight deck and cabin printers for the aerospace market. In addition, the T&M segment includes data acquisition recorders, sold under the AstroNova brand, to enable our customers to acquire and record visual and electronic signal data from local and networked data streams and sensors. The recorded data is processed, analyzed and stored and presented in various visual output formats. 
 Product Identification 
 Our PI segment includes three brands: QuickLabel, TrojanLabel, and GetLabels. The segment provides a wide array of digital end-to-end product marking and identification solutions including hardware, software, and supplies for OEMs, commercial printers, and brand owners. Our customers typically label or mark products on a short to mid-size run basis and benefit from the efficiency, flexibility, and cost-savings of digitally printing labels or packaging in their facility, on-demand, with the ability to accommodate multiple SKUs or variable data such as bar codes, lot numbers or expiration dates. QuickLabel brand products include tabletop printers, production-ready digital color label printers, and specialty OEM printing systems for either standalone output or inline integration with existing pre-processing and finishing systems. Customers use our digital printing products in a wide variety of industries, including chemical, cosmetics, food and beverage, medical products, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, and many others. TrojanLabel expands our customer market by providing a range of higher volume digital color printers, OEM printing systems, and supplies that target the more demanding needs of brand owners, commercial printers, label converters, and packaging manufacturers, giving them the ability to digitally mark or encode products directly or to produce labels for post-printing applications. GetLabels brand products include a full line of media supplies, including label materials, tags, inks, toners and thermal transfer ribbons designed for optimal performance with our printing hardware, while also being compatible with a wide variety of competitive and third-party printing hardware. 
 Current QuickLabel models include a selection of professional tabletop digital color label printers. The high-speed QL-120X was built on our pioneering and successful Kiaro! platform. To expand the product line further, in 2021, the QL-120Xe, a sister product to the dye ink QL-120X, was introduced in 2021 as a lower price point option for low-volume applications and price-sensitive customers. In 2020, we introduced the QL-120D which features high-performance pigment inks that can produce durable BS5609 certified labels and labels that can withstand a wide range of demanding environmental conditions from sterilization to cryogenic freezing. Introduced early in 2019, the high-performance QL-300 was the first 5-color toner-based electrophotographic tabletop production label printer in the market. In addition, our QuickLabel line of printers includes the QL-850, our next-generation wide-format inkjet color label printer, the QL-30 and QL-60 series, a family of high-end monochrome printers, and the QLS-4100 XE, a unique solution with the ability to digitally print full-color labels and tags using thermal transfer ribbon technology. 
 Our TrojanLabel portfolio includes a range of products from professional digital color label mini-presses to large-scale all-in-one inline specialty printing systems for both brand owners, OEMs, and commercial printers. The T2-C, a compact, digital mini-press designed for 24/7 label production, includes numerous differentiating features for several end-use market applications. The T2-L is a narrow format digital press designed specifically for flexible packaging substrates. Beyond label printing, the T3-OPX, the first of its kind direct-to-package printer, which was introduced in late 2019, allows printing directly onto a range of flat products, including cardboard, paper bags, flat wood planks and many other items using pigment inks that are resistant to both water and UV exposure. A professional label press and finishing system, the T4, enables print, die-cut, and lamination in an all-in-one machine with a much smaller footprint than others in the market. 
 GetLabels provides a broad range of high-quality supplies for both our printers and third-party printers including label and tag materials, inks, toner and thermal transfer material, all specifically designed and 
 
4 

  constructed for a wide variety of labeling applications. Label material and substrates are carefully qualified and tested in our Rhode Island Materials Research Laboratory to ensure durability and compatibility with our QuickLabel and TrojanLabel branded products, along with a variety of third-party printers. 
 The PI segment also develops and licenses various specialized software programs to design and manage labels, print images, manage and operate our printers and presses, and coordinate printing on an automated basis directly over networked systems. PI also provides worldwide training and support. 
 Test &Measurement 
 Products sold under our T&M segment are designed and manufactured for airborne printing solutions and data acquisition. Our aerospace products include flight deck printing solutions, networking hardware and specialized aerospace-grade thermal paper. Our data acquisition systems are used in research and development, flight testing, missile/rocket telemetry production monitoring, power and maintenance applications. These products are sold to customers in various industries, including aerospace & defense, automotive, commercial airline, energy, manufacturing and transportation, to meet their need to acquire and record data from local and networked data streams and sensors. 
 Airborne printers include our flagship ToughWriter® series used in the flight decks and cabins of military, commercial, and business aircraft to print hard copies of data required for the safe and efficient operation of aircraft. Examples of printed data include navigation maps, arrival and departure information, flight itineraries, weather maps, performance data, passenger data, and air traffic control data. ToughSwitch® Ethernet switches are used primarily in military aircraft and military vehicles to connect multiple computers or Ethernet devices. The airborne printers and Ethernet switches are ruggedized to comply with rigorous military and commercial flight worthiness standards for operation under extreme environmental conditions. We are currently furnishing ToughWriter airborne printers for many aircraft made by Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Lockheed, Gulfstream, and others. In addition to the ToughWriter products, we manufacture other flight deck printers, including the TP/NP series, the RTP80 series and the PTA-45B series of airborne printers. The PTA-45B is subject to the Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Honeywell International, Inc. (the “Honeywell Agreement”), pursuant to which in 2017 we acquired an exclusive perpetual world-wide license to manufacture and support Honeywell’s narrow-format flight deck printers for the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320 aircraft. Over time we expect customers to replace the PTA-45B printers with ToughWriter products because they have numerous technical features and functional advantages and significant weight savings. 
 Other T&M products include the TMX® all-in-one high-speed data acquisition system for applications requiring high channel counts and acquisition rates; the Daxus® DXS-100 distributed data acquisition platform; the SmartCorder® DDX-100, a portable all-in-one data acquisition system for facility maintenance and field testing; and the Everest® EV-5000 digital strip chart recording system used mainly in telemetry applications. The Daxus DXS-100 can be connected to the SmartCorder to increase channel count or networked as part of a distributed measurement system spanning vast distances. 
 Technology 
 Our core technologies are data visualization technologies that relate to (1) acquiring data, (2) conditioning the data, (3) displaying or printing the data on hard copy, monitor or electronic storage media, and (4) analyzing the data. To service data visualization, we maintain technological core competencies and trade know-how concerning the subject matter peculiar to each business unit. The technological disciplines are diverse and include electronic, software, mechanical and industrial engineering aspects. Additionally, we possess engineering expertise in digital signal processing, image processing, fluidics, color theory, high-speed material handling, and airworthiness design. 
Patents and Copyrights 
 We hold several product patents in the United States and in foreign countries. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions to protect our 
 
5 

  technology and brand names. We consider our intellectual property to be critical to the operation of our business. In particular, we believe that the loss of the trademarks QuickLabel, TrojanLabel, ToughWriter, or ToughSwitch or the loss of the license provided under the Honeywell Agreement could have a material adverse impact on our business taken as a whole. 
 Manufacturing and Supplies 
 We manufacture many of the products that we design and sell. Raw materials and supplies are typically available from a wide variety of sources. We manufacture many sub-assemblies and parts in-house, including certain specialty printed circuit board assemblies and harnesses, and we have extensive electronic and mechanical final assembly and test operations. Many parts not manufactured in-house are standard electronic items available from multiple sources. Other printers and parts are designed or modified by us and manufactured by outside vendors according to our specifications. We purchase certain components, assembled products, and supplies used to manufacture our products from a single source or limited supplier sources. Although we believe the majority of these sole or limited source components, assembled products, and supplies could be sourced elsewhere with appropriate changes in the design of our products, such design might not be feasible on a timely basis, and any interruption in these components, products or supplies could adversely affect our business. When circumstances cause us to anticipate that we may not be able to acquire such components, products or supplies on a timely basis, our practice is to procure a sufficient quantity in advance. In the past, we have made such advance purchases primarily for aerospace products and in quantities that we anticipate will suffice for the life of the aircraft program for which those printers are designed. 
Marketing and Competition 
 We compete worldwide in multiple markets. Through our expanding network of manufacturing, sales and support facilities, we do business in over 150 countries. 
 We believe we are a market leader in tabletop digital color label printing technology in the specialty printing field, a market leader in flight deck printers, and an innovator in digital color mini-press systems. In the data acquisition area, we are one of the leaders in general-purpose portable, high-speed data acquisition systems. 
 Management believes that we have a market leadership position in many of the markets we serve. We retain our leadership position by virtue of our proprietary technology, product reputation, delivery, our channels to market, technical assistance and service to customers. The number of competitors varies by product line. Key competitive factors vary among our product lines, but include technology, quality, service and support, distribution network and breadth of product and service offerings. 
 Our Product Identification products are sold by direct field salespersons as well as independent dealers and representatives, while our Test & Measurement products are sold predominantly through direct sales and manufacturers’ representatives. In the United States, we have factory-trained direct field salespeople located throughout the country specializing in Product Identification products. We also have direct field sales or service centers in Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, and the United Kingdom staffed by our own employees and dedicated third-party contractors. Additionally, we utilize approximately 200 independent dealers and representatives selling and marketing our products in 60 countries. 
 No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue in any of the last three fiscal years. 
 Order Backlog 
 Our backlog varies regularly. It consists of a blend of orders for end-user customers, as well as original equipment manufacturer customers. Manufacturing production is designed to meet forecasted demands and built-to-order customer requirements. Accordingly, the amount of order backlog may not indicate future sales trends. Backlog at January 31, 2022 and 2021 was $27.8 million and $22.5 million, respectively.

  Government Regulation 
 We are subject to a wide variety of laws, rules, mandates, and regulations, some of which apply or may apply to us as a result of our business particularly with respect to our aircraft cockpit printer business which sells in a highly regulated industry, and others of which apply to us for other reasons, such as our status as a publicly held company or the places in which we sell certain types or amounts of products. Existing and future laws and regulations may result in increasing expense and may impede our growth. Applicable and potentially applicable regulations and laws include regulations and laws regarding taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, distribution, energy consumption, environmental regulation, competition, consumer protection, employment, import and export matters, information reporting requirements, access to our services and facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics and quality of products and services, product labeling and unfair and deceptive trade practices. 
 Our business outside of the U.S. exposes us to foreign and additional U.S. laws and regulations, including but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to taxation, business licensing or certification requirements, consumer protection, intellectual property rights, consumer and data protection, privacy, encryption, restrictions on pricing or discounts, and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties. 
 Environmental Matters 
 We believe that we are in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws concerning the discharge of material into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. We have not experienced any material costs in connection with environmental compliance, and do not believe that such compliance will have any material effect upon the financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or competitive position of the Company. 
Employees 
 As of January 31, 2022, we employed 339 full-time employees. Of our full-time employees, 238 were in the United States, 80 in Europe, 10 in Canada, nine in Asia and two in Mexico. 
 None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement; except for our employees in France, where local regulations generally require collective bargaining agreements. 
 Successful execution of our business strategy depends on our ability to retain several key employees in both individual contributor and management roles. We continuously assess the risk of losing our key employees through regular communications, engagement surveys and assessments in the labor market. Our retention strategy is focused on ensuring competitive compensation packages, career and professional development, leadership coaching and other actions to improve overall engagement with our key employees. 
 Culture 
 We have ingrained a strong and definable company culture that shapes how we operate and engage with stakeholders and employees. Our culture consists of four key components: 

• | A powerful set of core values: Customer First, One Global Team, Innovation, Continuous Improvement and Building Shareholder Value.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The AstroNova Operating System (AOS), the comprehensive business management process which helps us manage the business to achieve continuous improvements in quality, delivery, cost, and growth.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A commitment to operating with integrity and compliance to ensure our business is conducted in an honest, legal, and environmentally responsible manner.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A passionate commitment to quality that drives our goal to achieve zero defects and understand our customers’ changing needs and expectations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



7 

  Our core values guide our employees’ behavior and dictate how our business is conducted. These core values are reinforced during new hire orientation, ongoing engagement surveys, leadership development, and team development activities and are also demonstrated through teamwork, leadership, and everyday interactions. 
 Diversity and Inclusion 
 We believe that our culture and core values are strengthened through diversity and inclusion. Our diversity initiatives include—but are not limited to—our practices and policies on recruitment and selection; compensation and benefits; professional development and training; promotions; transfers; social and recreational programs; layoffs; terminations; and the ongoing development of a work environment built on the premise of gender and diversity equity. These initiatives include periodic evaluation of our workforce demographics as compared to the demographics in the workforce market, and an affirmative effort to attract, recruit, retain and train a diverse workforce that is representative of the populations in the regions in which we do business. 
Other Information 
 Our business is not seasonal in nature. However, our revenue is impacted by the size of certain individual transactions, which can cause fluctuations in revenue from quarter to quarter. 
Available Information 
 We make available on our website (www.astronovainc.com) our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings are also accessible on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
The following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating AstroNova, because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business operations. 
Business and Industry Risks: 
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and will likely continue to adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. 
 All of our global operations have been materially adversely affected by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic during the past two years. We expect this adverse impact to continue to a degree that we cannot predict. 
 We made significant modifications to our global pre-pandemic operations because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We initially required most non-production related team members to work remotely. Although this no longer is required for health and safety reasons, for many of our team members, remote work has become a preference and we believe we have to a large degree successfully adapted to it through the use of technology and changed management practices, but further adaptations, unknown at this time, may be required. As the result of the changes that have been required by the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that the mix of on-site and remote work will be permanently changed, as will our increased safety protocols and the other adaptations undertaken during the pandemic, but our practices and plans are still developing, and we cannot predict the result yet.

  Since the COVID-19 pandemic began we have experienced difficulties in obtaining raw materials and components for our products. Some of the structural dislocations in the global economy caused by the pandemic are deepening and prolonging these difficulties. We have had to incur additional costs, such as expedited and express shipping fees (i.e., air rather than ocean freight.) These difficulties have also negatively impacted our efficiency, delayed shipments and caused product shortages. We are currently monitoring the world-wide delays in transit time, as freight carriers continue to experience significant delays in overseas shipments. We are addressing these issues through long range planning and procuring higher inventory on severely allocated items to help mitigate potential shortages whenever practicable. We are also monitoring and reacting to extended lead times on electronic components and utilizing a variety of strategies, including blanket orders, vendor-bonded inventories, extended commitments to our supply base, and seeking alternative suppliers. Additionally, we have taken actions to increase regular contact with our essential vendors and increased our forecasting horizon for our products to help us better manage our supply chain. In some cases, we are working with our vendors to help them procure components. Our strategies to counteract the impact of the pandemic and the related supply chain dislocations have increased the amount of inventory we maintain to support our product sales. We have also experienced several situations where component shortages and scarcity have required us to pay significantly higher costs to obtain those components. We will continue to monitor our supply chain going forward and update our mitigation strategies as we determine appropriate. We are not able to predict how current supply chain difficulties will develop in the future, and if the steps we are taking are not effective, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 Our Product Identification business has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic because our ability to meet with customers to demonstrate our products at trade shows and on-site in their facilities has been curtailed. We have partially countered this through a variety of virtual, on-line selling and digital marketing strategies, but the degree to which this will be successful to mitigate the lack of face-to-face selling is unclear. 
 The aerospace industry, which we serve through our aerospace product line, has also been significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, both inside and outside of the United States because of the severe decline in the demand for air travel, demand for aircraft, and a general curtailment of aircraft production rates. This has had a material adverse impact on our financial results. While air travel demand and aircraft production demand has recovered to some extent, it remains unclear whether these demand factors will continue to recover, and to what extent. The secondary impacts of the demand decline and resulting financial losses on the economic structure of the airline industry could become a negative factor for demand for aircraft due to industry consolidation. Individually or in combination, these factors may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results. 
 Our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated. 
 Any decline in our customers’ markets or their general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products. For example, the 2020 grounding, suspension and subsequent slow restart of production of the Boeing 737 MAX, and then the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the demand for new aircraft, reduced demand for our airborne printers that are installed on that aircraft, as well as the related repairs and supplies, which has negatively affected our results of operations. While these effects have begun to abate, demand remains lower than it was beforehand, and the outlook is uncertain. Some of our customers have been and may remain reluctant to make capital equipment purchases and may continue to defer certain of these purchases to future periods. While demand for air travel has recently increased, the impact of another period of COVID-19 infections could negatively impact this trend in the future. Also, we believe our customers’ markets have declined and the impact on their financial capacity has been material enough to alter their strategies and industry dynamics. These factors may cause demand for aircraft to grow slowly or decline, which would reduce our demand, and in turn which could harm our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
 
9 

  Our future revenue growth depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance of these new products and services. 
 The markets for our products are characterized by evolving technologies which in turn effect our product introduction cycles. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and supplying high-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services on a timely basis and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. The success of our new products will also depend on our ability to differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings, price our products competitively, anticipate our competitors’ development of new products, and maintain high levels of product quality and reliability. We spend a significant amount of time and effort on the development of our airborne and color printer products as well as our acquisition and data recorder products. Failure to meet our customers’ changing business needs or to further develop any of our new products and their related markets as anticipated could adversely affect our future revenue growth and operating results. 
 As we introduce new or enhanced products, we must also successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. The introduction of new or enhanced products may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing existing products in anticipation of the new products. Additionally, when we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand, manage excess and obsolete inventories, address new or higher product cost structures, and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products. Any customer uncertainty regarding the timeline for rolling out new products or our plans for future support of existing products may cause customers to delay purchase decisions or purchase competing products which would adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 Operational and Business Strategy Risks: 
 We are dependent upon contract manufacturers for some of our products. If these manufacturers do not meet our requirements, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed. 
 We subcontract the manufacturing and assembly of certain of our products to independent third parties at facilities located in various countries. Relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks, including: 
 

• | Disruptions in the global supply chain;
--+----------------------------------------


• | Limited control over the manufacturing process;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Potential absence of adequate production capacity;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | Potential delays in production lead times;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Unavailability of certain process technologies; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If one of our significant subcontractors becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture or provide these products in required volumes or fails to meet our quality standards, we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors or take over the manufacturing ourselves. Additional qualified subcontractors may not be available or may not be available on a timely or cost competitive basis. Any interruption in the supply, increase in the cost of the products manufactured by a third-party subcontractor or failure of a subcontractor to meet quality standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
10 

  For certain components, assembled products and supplies, we are dependent upon single or limited source suppliers. If these suppliers do not meet demand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed. 
 Although we use standard parts and components for our products where possible, we purchase certain components, assembled products and supplies used in the manufacture of our products from a single source or limited supplier sources. If the supply of a key component, assembled products or certain supplies were to be delayed or curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or sole supplier delays shipment of such components or assembled products, our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected. For example, due to the continued global COVID-19 pandemic, there has been and likely will continue to be disruption to our supply chain due to the delays of component shipments from our vendors in China and other jurisdictions in which normal business operations are disrupted. Our business, results of operations and financial position could also be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Additionally, if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components, assembled products or supplies in required volumes, we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components. Alternative sources may not be available, or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis. Any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components, assembled products and supplies provided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 We face significant competition, and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We operate in an environment of significant competition, especially in the markets in which we sell our PI printers and T&M data acquisition products. This competition is driven by rapid technological advances, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the demands of customers to become more efficient. Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. We compete based on technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. Additionally, current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products or services with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully, our customers could seek alternative solutions from our competitors and we could lose market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. 
 Our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to control our cost structure. 
Our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services. For a variety of complex reasons, many of which were triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the general economy has been significantly impacted by supply chain disruptions. Examples of some of these impacts on us include reduced availability of certain electronic components and the need to pay premium prices to obtain them, and noticeably higher costs for a wide array of other parts and raw material components. This has been exacerbated by significant increases in the cost of transportation to expedite incoming components and supplies. In many cases we have had to expedite delivery of critical materials through significantly higher cost airfreight methods. Our ability to offset these effects through pricing actions for our products and services may not prove sufficient to offset these or further cost increases. Attempts to increase prices may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected. 
 We are also continually reviewing our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to reducing our labor cost-to-revenue ratio, improving process and system efficiencies and 
 
11 

  outsourcing certain internal functions. From time to time, we also engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. However, if these efforts to constrain the cost of our operations are inadequate to offset higher product and employee wage costs, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected. 
 Our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property, defend against assertions of infringement or lose certain licenses could prevent or restrict our ability to compete. 
 We rely on patents, trademarks, licenses, and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design technologies around the intellectual property protections or licenses that we currently own. The loss of the trademarks QuickLabel, TrojanLabel, ToughWriter and ToughSwitch or the loss of the licenses provided under the Honeywell Agreement could have a material adverse impact on our business taken as a whole. Operating outside the United States also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. The laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States. Any diminution in our ability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement, which could result in significant costs and divert our management’s focus away from operations. 
 We have significant inventories on hand. 
 We maintain a significant amount of inventory, and a result of recent supply chain disruption expect to increase the amount of inventory we maintain on-hand. Although we have provided an allowance for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, any significant unanticipated changes in future product demand or market conditions, including obsolescence or the uncertainty in the global market, as well as continued reduced demand for our products if the COVID-19 pandemic is further prolonged, could have an impact on the value of inventory and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 We could incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. 
 We have incurred and could in the future incur additional liabilities because of product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. Our products may have defects despite our internal testing or testing by customers. These defects could result in among other things, a delay in recognition of sales, loss of sales, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance or damage to our reputation. We could be subject to material claims by customers and may incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects. While in the past, we have successfully obtained partial compensation from suppliers for their contribution to product quality issues, we may not be successful in such a recovery in the future, and these recoveries have not in the past and are not in the future likely to fully offset the full financial impact on us. 
 In addition, through our acquisitions, we have assumed, and may in the future assume, liabilities related to products previously developed by an acquired company that have not been subjected to adequate product development, testing and quality control processes, and may have unknown or undetected defects. Some types of defects may not be detected until the product is installed in a user environment. This may cause us to incur significant warranty, repair or re-engineering costs. As such, it could also divert the attention of engineering personnel from product development efforts which may result in increased costs and lower profitability. 
 We could experience a significant disruption in or security breach of our information technology system which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We rely on on-premises and cloud-based information technology systems, some of which are managed by or licensed from third parties, to support many critical aspects of our business, as well as, to process, transmit and

  store our own electronic proprietary or confidential information, and confidential information of customers, employees, suppliers and others including personally identifiable information, credit card data, and other proprietary confidential information.    These systems are vulnerable to damage, disruptions and/or shutdowns due to attack by cyber-criminals, data breaches, employee error, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, catastrophic events or other unforeseen events. These vulnerabilities could interfere with our operations, compromise our data processing capacity and the security of our information and that of our customers and suppliers, and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation. We actively manage these risks through a variety of hardware and software-based techniques that we own, license or otherwise procure from third parties under contract to safeguard our systems, and we own or procure from third parties system data storage redundancy and disaster recovery capability. In particular we have increased our investment in tools, techniques and training that we believe will reduce our vulnerability to attacks from cyber-criminals. However due to the complexity of our systems, and especially due to the ever-increasing sophistication of cyber-criminals, there is no assurance that our efforts will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks, security breaches, or the other potential exploitation of vulnerabilities or systems failures. In any such circumstance, our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact. However, in the future such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to our brand and reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 We depend on our key employees and other highly qualified personnel and our ability to attract and develop new, talented professionals. Our inability to attract and retain key employees, as well as challenges with respect to the management of human capital resources, could compromise our future success and our business could be harmed. 
 Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain, through competitive compensation and benefits programs, professional and executive employees, including sales, operating, marketing, and financial management personnel as well as our ability to manage human capital resources. There is substantial competition for skilled personnel, and the failure to attract, develop, retain and motivate qualified personnel could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In order to hire new personnel or retain or replace our key personnel, we must maintain competitive compensation and benefits, and we may also be required to increase compensation, which would decrease net income. Additionally, several key employees have special knowledge of customers, supplier relationships, business processes, manufacturing operations, and financial management issues. The loss of any of these employees as the result of competitive compensation pressures or ineffective management of human capital resources could harm our ability to perform efficiently and effectively until their knowledge and skills are replaced, which might be difficult to do quickly, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could impede our ability to grow and could result in our inability to operate our business profitably. 
 Although we have not experienced any material disruptions due to labor shortages to date, we have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market, and the demand for qualified individuals is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future. Any sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, whether caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors or wage competition, could lead to increased costs and lost profitability and could otherwise compromise us in efficiently operating our business. 
 We may record future impairment charges, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations. 
 We test our goodwill balances annually, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
 
13 

  and, monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. Declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group, changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses, or changes in other key assumptions, may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 We also review our long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, and other intangibles assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant negative industry or economic trends and our market capitalization relative to net book value. We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our long-lived assets is determined. Such charges could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and our financial condition. 
 Financial and Economic Risks: 
 Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. 
 Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Revenue from international operations, which includes both direct and indirect sales to customers outside the U.S., accounted for approximately 40% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2022, and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, we have employees, suppliers, contractors and facilities located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: 

• | Interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer and vendor financial stability;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Changes in a specific country’s or region’s environment including political, economic, monetary, regulatory or other conditions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Negative consequences from changes in tax laws;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Difficulty in managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Difficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate staffing;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Differing labor regulations;
--+-----------------------------


• | Failure to comply with complex and rapidly changing government economic sanctions measures against other countries, especially arising from responses to armed conflict;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | Uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, commonly known as “Brexit”; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war and public health disruptions, such as that caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To date the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting governmental sanctions and our decision to halt all activities in the affected areas has had an immaterial impact on revenues.

  Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods. 
As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is based on the tax rates in effect where we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each jurisdiction. Our effective tax rate may vary as a result of numerous factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, whether we secure or sustain acceptable arrangements with tax authorities, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations. 
 Changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, could have a material impact on our estimates of our effective tax rate and our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The impact of these factors may be substantially different from period-to-period. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. Any further significant changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could adversely affect our financial statements. 
 We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could negatively impact our income tax expense, net income and cash flow. 
 We are subject to income and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities and to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax benefit or expense, net loss or income, and cash flows in the period in which such determination is made. 
 Deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amount for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. In some cases, we may record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. We review our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance requirements quarterly. If we are unable to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net carrying value of deferred tax assets, we will record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value, which could result in a material income tax charge. As part of our review, we consider positive and negative evidence, including cumulative results of recent years. 
 If we are unable to successfully comply with our credit agreement with Bank of America or secure alternative financing, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
 Our credit agreement with Bank of America requires us, among other things, to satisfy certain financial ratios on an ongoing basis, consisting of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. We are also required to comply with other covenants and conditions, set forth in the credit agreement, including, among others, limitations on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur future indebtedness, to place liens on assets, to pay dividends or distributions on their capital stock, to repurchase or 
 
15 

  acquire their capital stock, to conduct mergers or acquisitions, to sell assets, to alter their capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions and thresholds as set forth in the credit agreement. If we were to violate the terms of the credit agreement and we were unable to renegotiate its terms at that time or secure alternative financing, it could have a material adverse impact on us. 
 The agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. 
 The credit agreement governing our credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as amended, contains, and any future debt agreements may include, several restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to: 
 

• | Incur future indebtedness;
--+---------------------------


• | Place liens on assets;
--+-----------------------


• | Pay dividends or distributions on our and our subsidiaries’ capital stock;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Repurchase or acquire our capital stock;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | Conduct mergers or acquisitions;
--+---------------------------------


• | Sell assets; and/or
--+--------------------


• | Alter our or our subsidiaries’ capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures and strategic partnerships, and integration of acquired companies or divestiture of businesses may negatively impact our overall business. 
 We have made strategic investments in other companies, products and technologies. We will continue to identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets, such as customer bases, products and technology. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities. In any acquisition that we complete we cannot be certain that: 
 

• | We will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | All the benefits expected from such integration will be realized;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Management’s attention will not be diverted or divided, to the detriment of current operations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Amortization of acquired intangible assets or possible impairment of acquired intangibles will not have a negative impact on operating results or other aspects of our business;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental impact on our business, operating results and financial condition;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer dissatisfaction with, or performance problems at, an acquired company will not have an adverse impact on our reputation; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Respective operations, management and personnel will be compatible.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


In certain instances, as permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules, acquisitions may be consummated without seeking and obtaining shareholder approval, in which case shareholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in an acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks. 
 
16 

  We may also divest certain businesses from time to time. Divestitures will likely involve risks, such as difficulty splitting up businesses, distracting employees, potential loss of revenue and negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customer relationships. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to: 
 

• | Effectively transfer assets, liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. 
 If we are not able to successfully integrate or divest businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire or divest, or able to realize expected benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures or strategic partnerships, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets could impair our liquidity or interrupt our access to capital markets, borrowings or financial transactions to hedge certain risks. 
 At the end of fiscal 2022, we had approximately $5.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in a mix of money market funds, bank demand deposit accounts and foreign bank accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets such as those caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our financial position. 
 To date, we have been able to access financing that has allowed us to make investments in growth opportunities and fund working capital requirements as needed. In addition, we occasionally enter into financial transactions to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Our continued access to capital markets, the stability of our lenders and their willingness to support our needs, and the stability of the counter-parties to our financial transactions that hedge risks are essential for us to meet our current and long-term obligations, fund operations, and fund our future strategic initiatives. An interruption in our access to external financing or financial transactions to hedge risk could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. 
 Inadequate self-insurance accruals or insurance coverage for employee health care benefits could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results or financial condition. 
 In the U.S., we maintain an employee health insurance coverage plan on a self-insured basis backed by stop-loss coverage which sets a limit on our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs. We record expenses based on actual claims incurred and estimates of the costs of expected claims, administrative costs, and stop-loss insurance premiums. 
 We record a liability for our estimated cost of U.S. claims incurred and unpaid as of each balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is recorded on an undiscounted basis and is based on historical trends. Our history of claims activity is closely monitored, and liabilities are adjusted as warranted based on changing circumstances. It is possible, however, that our actual liabilities may exceed our estimates of loss. We may also experience an unexpectedly large number of claims that result in costs or liabilities in excess of our projections, which could cause us to record additional expenses, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We believe that the liabilities we have recorded to date will be sufficient to provide for losses we may incur due to increased COVID-19 related employee health care insurance costs. However, the ultimate amount of these costs cannot be estimated at this time, and a prolonged period of spread of the disease could further increase our costs and liabilities, the impact of which may be material.

  Legal and Regulatory Risks: 
 Certain of our products require certifications by customers, regulators or standards organizations, and our failure to obtain or maintain such certifications could negatively impact our business. 
 In certain industries and for certain products, such as those used in aircraft, we must obtain certifications for our products by customers, regulators or standards organizations. If we fail to obtain required certifications for our products, or if we fail to maintain such certifications on our products after they have been certified, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We are subject to laws and regulations; failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Our operations are subject to laws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. In addition, we must comply with regulations restricting our ability to include lead and certain other substances in our products. If we do not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted. 
 Certain of our operations and products are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which may result in substantial compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. 
 Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, including those that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, establish standards for the use, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, and govern the cleanup of contaminated sites. As such, our business is subject to and may be materially and adversely affected by compliance obligations and other liabilities under those environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Certain of our products contain, and some of manufacturing operations use various substances which have been or may be deemed to be hazardous or dangerous. Thus, we have and will continue to generate a generally limited amounts of hazardous wastes in our operations. We manage our compliance with laws and regulations and the proper mitigation of risks internally and through the input or external consultants and outside service providers and we believe we are in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. We desire to reduce and ultimately eliminate any adverse environmental impact of our business and to comply with relevant laws and regulations. We expect this effort to affect our ongoing operations and require additional capital and operating expenditures. If we were to fail to manage our environmental compliance effectively, we could suffer economic or reputational harm. 
 As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, we have been required by U.S. federal and state governmental authorities and governmental authorities in non-U.S. jurisdictions, as well as our own desire to adhere to best health and safety practices, and have implemented new policies and procedures to reduce infection risk in our operations. These initiatives have increased our costs and added complexity and inefficiency to our manufacturing operations and all administrative and office-based functions. 
 Our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we or any of our subsidiaries has violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption 
 
18 

  to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by those of our employees or agents who violate our policies. 
 Unauthorized access to personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights and compliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly. 
 We collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Security breaches or other unauthorized access to, or the use or transmission of, personal user information could result in a variety of claims against us, including privacy-related claims. There are numerous federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of this kind of information, the scope of which are changing, inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations. 
 We also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. For example, in 2016 the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a comprehensive privacy and data protection reform that became effective in May 2018. The GDPR, which is applicable to all companies processing data of European Union residents, imposes significant fines and sanctions for violations. Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which was enacted in June 2018 and came into effect on January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. 
 Additionally, other jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data generated in or relating to the residents of those jurisdictions to be physically stored within those jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws and regulations apply not only to transfers between unrelated third parties but also to transfers between us and our subsidiaries. All these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time. 
 While we continue to assess these requirements and the ways they may impact the conduct of our business, we believe that we materially comply with applicable laws and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. There is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws or codes of conduct, that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims or that we will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event we are found not to be in compliance with such laws or codes of conduct. 
 Any failure or perceived failure by us (or any third parties with whom we have contracted to store such information) to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, policies or related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to personal information may result in governmental enforcement actions, significant fines, litigation, claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity. In the case of such an event, our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential users and the competitive positions of our various brands could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. 
 Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as 
 
19 

  revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, inventories, business combinations and intangible asset valuations, leases, and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition.
