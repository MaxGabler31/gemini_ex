Item 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES
Overview
We are a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by BP Pipelines, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BP, to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets. Our assets consist of interests in entities that own crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent pipelines and refined product terminals serving as key infrastructure for BP and other customers to transport onshore crude oil production to BP’s Whiting Refinery and offshore crude oil and natural gas production to key refining markets and trading and distribution hubs. Certain of our assets deliver refined products and diluent from the Whiting Refinery and other U.S. supply hubs to major demand centers. 

We own one onshore crude oil pipeline system, one onshore refined products pipeline system, one onshore diluent pipeline system, and interests in five offshore crude oil pipeline systems, one refined product terminalling system and one offshore natural gas pipeline system. Our onshore crude oil pipeline, BP2, indirectly links Canadian crude oil production with BP’s Whiting Refinery, the largest refinery in the Midwest. Our River Rouge refined products pipeline system connects the Whiting Refinery to the Detroit refined products market. Our Diamondback diluent pipeline indirectly connects the Whiting Refinery and other diluent supply sources to a third-party pipeline for ultimate delivery to the Canadian oil sands production areas. The offshore crude oil pipeline systems, which include our interests in Mars Oil Pipeline Company, LLC and the pipeline system and related assets owned by such entity (collectively, "Mars"), URSA Oil Pipeline Company, LLC ("Ursa") and through our ownership in Mardi Gras Transportation System Company, LLC ("Mardi Gras"), Caesar Oil Pipeline Company, LLC and the pipeline system and related assets owned by such entity (collectively, ("Caesar"), Proteus Oil Pipeline Company, LLC and the pipeline system and related assets owned by such entity (collectively, ("Proteus") and Endymion Oil Pipeline Company, LLC and the pipeline system and related assets owned by such entity (collectively, ("Endymion"), link major offshore production areas in the Gulf of Mexico with the Gulf Coast refining and distribution hubs. The offshore natural gas pipeline system, Cleopatra Gas Gathering Company, LLC and the pipeline system and related assets owned by such entity (collectively, "Cleopatra") (also owned through our ownership interest in Mardi Gras), links offshore production areas in the Gulf of Mexico to an offshore pipeline for ultimate delivery to shore. Our ownership interest in the onshore refined products terminal network, KM Phoenix Holdings, LLC ("KM Phoenix"), has 13 refined products storage and terminalling systems located across the United States in markets that are highly strategic to supporting BP's refining, trading and marketing businesses.

We have historically generated substantially all of our revenue under long-term agreements or FERC-regulated generally applicable tariffs by charging fees for the transportation of products through our pipelines. Substantially all of our aggregate revenue on BP2, Diamondback and River Rouge is supported by commercial agreements with BP Products. BP Products has entered into minimum volume commitment agreements with respect to BP2, River Rouge and Diamondback that have terms running through December 31, 2020. We also have a second minimum volume commitment agreement on Diamondback, with a term running through June 30, 2020. BP Pipelines also granted us a seven-year ROFO through 2024 with respect to its retained ownership interest in Mardi Gras and all of its interests in midstream pipeline systems and assets related thereto in the contiguous United States and offshore Gulf of Mexico that are owned by BP Pipelines. We refer to these assets collectively as the “Subject Assets”. 
Business Strategies

Our primary business objectives are maintaining the safe and reliable operation of our assets to generate stable and predictable cash flows and increase our quarterly cash distribution per unit over time while maintaining a conservative balance sheet.

• | Maintain Safe and Reliable Operations. We are committed to safe, reliable and efficient operations, which are key components in generating stable cash flows. We strive for operational excellence by using BP Pipelines’ existing programs to integrate health, occupational safety, process safety and environmental principles throughout our business with a commitment to continuous improvement. BP Pipelines’ employees have and will continue to operate each of the Wholly 

7

Owned Assets. An affiliate of Royal Dutch Shell plc ("Shell") operates Mars, Ursa and each of Caesar, Proteus, Cleopatra and Endymion (together, the "Mardi Gras Joint Ventures"). An affiliate of Kinder Morgan operates KM Phoenix. BP Pipelines, Kinder Morgan and Shell are industry-leading pipeline operators that have been recognized for safety and reliability and continually invest in the maintenance and integrity of their assets. We continue to employ BP Pipelines’ rigorous training, integrity and audit programs to drive ongoing improvements in safety as we strive for zero incidents in our operating assets. 

• | Generate Stable, Fee-Based Cash Flows Supported by Contracts with Minimum Volume Commitments. We are focused on generating stable and predictable cash flows by providing fee-based transportation services to BP and third parties with limited direct exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We have multiple fee-based commercial agreements with BP Products that include, for our onshore assets, minimum volume commitments. We believe these agreements should promote stability and predictability in our cash flows. In addition, many of our offshore assets have either commitments for dedicated production from specified fields as well as provide a primary supply source to major distribution and storage facilities, providing further stability to our cash flows. 


• | Pursue Opportunities to Grow Our Business. We continually seek to grow our business by completing strategic acquisitions, executing organic expansion projects, and increasing the utilization of our existing assets. 


◦ | Growth through Strategic Acquisitions. We pursue strategic acquisitions of assets from BP and third parties. At our IPO, BP Pipelines granted us a ROFO with respect to its retained ownership interest in Mardi Gras and all of its interests in midstream pipeline systems and assets related thereto in the contiguous United States and offshore Gulf of Mexico that are owned by BP Pipelines. In addition, we believe BP will offer us opportunities to acquire additional midstream assets that it may acquire or develop in the future. We also may have opportunities to pursue the acquisition or development of additional assets jointly with BP. 


◦ | Pursue Attractive Organic Growth Opportunities. We evaluate organic expansion projects that are consistent with our existing business operations and that will provide compelling returns to our unitholders. This strategy will include seeking opportunities to enhance the profitability of our existing assets by increasing throughput volumes, opportunistically attracting new third-party volumes, managing costs and enhancing operating efficiencies. 


• | Target a Conservative and Flexible Capital Structure. We target credit metrics consistent with the profile of investment grade midstream energy companies although we do not expect to immediately seek a rating on our debt. Furthermore, we intend to maintain a balanced capital structure while pursuing (i) strategic acquisitions of assets from BP, (ii) potential organic growth opportunities, and (iii) potential third-party acquisitions. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe that we are well positioned to execute our business strategies based on the following competitive strengths:

• | Our Relationship with BP. We have a strategic relationship with BP, one of the largest producers of crude oil and natural gas as well as one of the leading petroleum products refiners in the United States. BP is our most significant customer of the Wholly Owned Assets and also a material customer of Mars, Ursa, KM Phoenix and each of the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures. BP is well capitalized with an investment grade credit rating and indirectly owns our general partner, a majority of our limited partner interests and all of our incentive distribution rights. In addition, BP owns a substantial number of additional midstream assets, including an 35% interest in Mardi Gras. We believe that our relationship with BP will provide us with significant growth opportunities as well as a stable base of cash flows. 


• | Strategically Located and Highly Integrated Assets. Our assets are primarily located in the Midwestern United States and in the Gulf of Mexico and are strategic to BP’s North American operations. 


◦ | Onshore Assets. Our Midwestern assets play a critical role in maintaining a supply of Canadian heavy crude oil to, and moving refined products and diluent from, the Whiting Refinery. BP’s Whiting Refinery is the largest refinery in the Midwest and is well positioned to access Canadian heavy crude oil. In 2013, BP finished a multi-billion dollar, multi-year modernization project at the Whiting Refinery that was one of the largest downstream initiatives in the history of BP. This project provided the Whiting Refinery with the flexibility to shift from processing primarily higher-cost sweet crude to discounted heavy crude oil, largely from Canada. BP is making further investments to increase the Whiting Refinery’s heavy crude capacity from 325 kbpd towards 350 kbpd by 2020. In order to position the Whiting Refinery to access additional Canadian crude supply, BP made a capital 

8

investment in BP2 to expand its capacity from approximately 240 kbpd to 475 kbpd. Our BP2 pipeline is strategically advantaged as the Whiting Refinery’s primary source of Canadian crude oil, although BP also has access to an alternative crude oil pipeline that delivers crude oil to the Whiting Refinery. Our KM Phoenix terminalling assets are highly strategic to supporting BP's refining, trading and marketing businesses.

◦ | Offshore Assets. Our Gulf of Mexico assets link BP and third-party producers’ offshore crude oil and natural gas production to the Gulf Coast refining and processing markets, and are located in areas of the Gulf of Mexico that are experiencing production growth and are expected to provide additional transportation volumes. The assets will become an increasingly important link to onshore markets following Shell’s sanctioned multi-billion dollar investment in the Appomattox platform and BP’s recent $9 billion investment in the Mad Dog 2 platform (“Mad Dog 2”). Due to the difficulty of obtaining construction permits, the capital intensive nature of offshore midstream assets and the remaining capacity in existing offshore pipelines, we believe offshore assets such as ours are well-positioned to capture new volumes from the Gulf of Mexico. 


• | Stable and Predictable Cash Flows. Our assets primarily consist of interests in common carrier pipeline systems that generate stable revenue under FERC-regulated tariffs and long-term fee-based transportation agreements. Substantially all of our aggregate revenue on BP2, River Rouge and Diamondback are supported by long-term commercial agreements with BP Products that include minimum volume commitments. We also believe that our strong position as the outlet for major offshore production with growing production activity as well as our strategic importance to the Whiting Refinery will provide us with sustainable and growing cash flows. 


• | Financial Flexibility. We have a revolving credit facility with an affiliate of BP with a capacity of $600.0 million, and as of December 31, 2018 we had $468.0 million of outstanding borrowings, which were drawn to fund the acquisition of assets from affiliates of BP on October 1, 2018. We believe that we will have the financial flexibility to execute our growth strategy through borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and access to capital markets. 


• | Experienced Management Team. Our management team has substantial experience in the management and operation of pipelines and other midstream assets. Our management team also has expertise in executing optimization strategies in the midstream sector. Our management team consists of members of BP Pipelines’ and BP’s senior management, who average over 30 years of experience in the energy industry.

Onshore Crude Oil, Refined Products and Diluent Pipelines

BP2.

General. BP2 is a crude oil pipeline system consisting of approximately 12 miles of 20- and 22-inch active pipeline and related assets, transporting crude oil for BP from the third-party owned Griffith Terminal in Griffith, Indiana to BP’s Whiting Refinery in Whiting, Indiana under FERC-regulated posted tariffs. The Whiting Refinery is the largest refinery in the Midwestern United States with a capacity of approximately 430 kbpd and has been in operation for more than a century. In 2013, BP finished a multi-billion dollar, multi-year modernization project at the Whiting Refinery that was one of the largest downstream initiatives in the history of BP. The project has modernized the Whiting Refinery by reconfiguring its crude distillation unit and adding advanced hydro-treating, sulphur recovery and coking capacity. With the project’s completion, the Whiting Refinery has the flexibility to shift from processing primarily higher-cost sweet crude to discounted heavy crude oil, largely from Canada. 
BP currently intends to further increase the heavy crude processing capacity at Whiting Refinery from 325 kbpd towards 350 kbpd by 2020, and BP recently expanded BP2’s capacity from approximately 240 kbpd to 475 kbpd to accommodate this growth. BP2 has the ability to ship a wide variety of crude oil types, including heavy, sour, sweet, and synthetic crude. The Whiting Refinery depends on BP2 as its primary source of Canadian heavy crude, and we believe that it has a significant transportation cost advantage over Gulf Coast refiners in accessing this growing supply source. BP also has access to an alternative crude oil pipeline that delivers crude oil to the Whiting Refinery.

Ownership and Operatorship. We own a 100% interest in BP2 and operate the pipeline.

Customers. BP has historically been the sole shipper on BP2.

Contracts. BP2 has historically generated revenue through published tariffs (regulated by the FERC) applied to volumes moved. FERC-approved tariffs may be adjusted annually based on a FERC-published index. The BP2 rate was previously set by settlement and has been subsequently indexed. The tariff applicable to BP2 for crude oil transportation include FLA, which provides additional revenue to offset potential product losses on BP2. We have entered into a commercial agreement with BP Products that includes a minimum volume commitment for BP2 and that supports substantially all of our revenue on BP2. Under this fee-based agreement, we provide transportation services to BP Products, and BP Products commits to pay us for minimum volumes of crude oil through December 31, 2020, regardless of whether such volumes are physically shipped by BP Products through our pipeline during the term of the agreement.

12

River Rouge.

General. River Rouge is a refined products pipeline system consisting of approximately 244 miles of 12-and 10-inch active pipeline and related assets with a capacity of approximately 80 kbpd transporting refined products for BP from BP’s Whiting Refinery to a third party’s refined products terminal in River Rouge, Michigan, a major market outlet serving the greater Detroit, Michigan area, as well as third-party terminals along the pipeline. River Rouge is the most direct pipeline route for BP’s refined products from the Chicago area to the Detroit market and also serves four other third-party terminals along its pipeline. River Rouge is the sole source of refined products for three of these terminals.

Ownership and Operatorship. We own a 100% interest in and operate River Rouge.

Customers. BP has historically been the sole shipper on River Rouge.

Contracts. River Rouge has historically generated revenue through published tariffs (regulated by the FERC) applied to volumes moved. FERC-approved tariffs may be adjusted annually based on a FERC-published index. The River Rouge rate was previously set based on a cost-of-service method and has been subsequently indexed. We entered into a commercial agreement with BP Products that includes a minimum volume commitment for River Rouge and that supports substantially all of our revenue on River Rouge. Under this fee-based agreement, we provide transportation services to BP Products, and BP Products commits to pay us for minimum volumes of refined products through December 31, 2020, regardless of whether such volumes are physically shipped by BP Products through our pipeline during the term of the agreement.

Diamondback.

General. Diamondback is a diluent pipeline system consisting of approximately 42 miles of 16-inch active pipeline and related assets with a capacity of approximately 135 kbpd transporting diluent from Diamondback’s Black Oak Junction in Gary, Indiana to a third-party owned pipeline in Manhattan, Illinois. The diluent is ultimately transported to Alberta, Canada to be used as a blending agent in the transportation of Canadian heavy crude oil. Black Oak Junction receives diluent from BP’s Whiting Refinery via the Wolverine Pipeline, as well as product originating from Gulf Coast and other Midcontinent supply hubs, Midwest producers and refineries. Diamondback is the primary logistics outlet for diluent from BP’s Whiting Refinery.

Ownership and Operatorship. We own a 100% interest in Diamondback and operate the pipeline.

Customers. Diamondback’s customers include BP as well as multinational integrated oil and gas companies, international and regional trading companies, and Alberta oil producers.

Contracts. Diamondback has historically generated revenue through published tariffs (regulated by the FERC) applied to volumes moved, and certain volumes have been transported pursuant to long-term contracts, which have a weighted average term of three years (based on transported volumes). FERC-approved tariffs may be adjusted annually based on a FERC-published index. The Diamondback rate was previously set by settlement and has been subsequently indexed. We are a party to a commercial agreement with BP Products that includes minimum volume commitments for Diamondback. Under this fee-based agreement, we provide transportation services to BP Products, and BP Products commits to pay us for a minimum of 8.4 million barrels of diluent in each of the 12 month periods of the agreement's term or approximately 23 kbpd of diluent through June 30, 2020, regardless of whether such volumes are physically shipped by BP Products through our pipeline during the term of the agreement. We also have a second commercial agreement with BP Products that includes minimum volume commitments for Diamondback. Under this fee-based agreement, we provide transportation services to BP Products, and BP Products commits to pay us for minimum volumes of diluent through December 31, 2020, regardless of whether such volumes are physically shipped by BP Products through our pipeline during the term of the agreement. These agreements support a substantial portion of our revenue on Diamondback.

Offshore Crude Oil and Natural Gas Pipelines.

Mars.

General. Mars is a major corridor crude oil pipeline system in a high-growth area of the Gulf of Mexico, delivering crude oil production received from the Mississippi Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico, including the Olympus platform, the Mars A platform, the Medusa and Ursa pipelines, and from the Green Canyon and Walker Ridge areas via Amberjack pipeline connection at Fourchon, Louisiana, to shore, terminating in salt dome caverns in Clovelly, Louisiana. The Mars pipeline system is approximately 163 miles in length with capacity, which represents the capacity of the approximately 54 mile segment from the connections to Ursa and Medusa pipelines at the West Delta 143 platform complex to the connection with Amberjack pipeline at Fourchon, Louisiana, of approximately 400 kbpd. The capacity of the Mars pipeline system ranges from 100 kbpd to 600 kbpd depending on the pipeline segment and the type of crude oil transported. Mars is connected to the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port ("LOOP") storage complex, which provides tanker offloading and temporary storage services for the crude oil industry and has access to multiple attractive downstream markets. Mars leases a cavern from LOOP LLC, which provides it with additional operational flexibility and protection for its operations from extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes. As a corridor pipeline, Mars is positioned to allow additional connections from new production platforms and supply pipelines without significant capital expenditures. We expect Mars will be an increasingly important conduit for crude oil produced in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico because it provides the Mississippi Canyon platforms as well as third-party pipelines with access to the LOOP storage complex.

Ownership and Operatorship. We own a 28.5% interest and an affiliate of Shell owns the remaining 71.5% interest in Mars. An affiliate of Shell operates the Mars pipeline. Under the Mars limited liability company agreement, Mars is managed by a management committee that has full power and authority to manage the entire business and affairs of the Mars pipeline system and oversee the operations of the Mars operator. For as long as there are only two non-affiliated members of Mars, all decisions of the management committee require the vote of at least 51% of the ownership interests in the company, except for certain actions including approving contracts with an affiliate of the operator or approving capital budgets and operating budgets, which require a vote of 100% of the ownership interests, or fundamental actions, including approving capital expenditures above certain amounts, authorizing the borrowing of money on the credit of the company and the dissolution of the company, each of which also requires the vote of members representing 100% of the ownership interests.

The Mars limited liability company agreement provides for cash distributions to the members from time to time, and the management committee may from time to time issue a capital call notice to the members. Under the Mars limited liability company agreement, each member’s interest is subject to transfer restrictions, including a right of first refusal in favor of the other members. Subject to certain exceptions, the Mars limited liability company agreement provides that the company’s existence shall continue indefinitely unless dissolved earlier pursuant to the vote of a unanimous interest.
14


Customers. Mars maintains a growing set of well-established customers, including BP. Mars is connected to several production platforms and the Ursa and Medusa pipeline systems, which tie back to Mars, bringing the production from additional production platforms dedicated to these two pipelines into Mars. Mars also receives significant volume from Amberjack at Fourchon, Louisiana, the terminus of Amberjack pipeline system.

Contracts. Mars generates revenue through published tariffs (regulated by the FERC or the Louisiana Public Service Commission) applied to volumes moved, and certain volumes are transported pursuant to long-term fee-based life-of-lease transportation agreements. Certain fee-based life-of-lease transportation agreements with producers include guaranteed rates-of-return for Mars for an initial period of time where the transportation rate is adjusted annually to achieve a pre-determined rate of return. Subsequent to the expiration of the initial period the rates under the contracts will be no greater than those in effect at the end of the initial period and will continue for the life of the lease with annual adjustments that are no less than zero percent and no greater than the FERC-approved index.

Mardi Gras Joint Ventures

The Partnership, BP Pipelines and the Standard Oil Company, an Ohio corporation (“Standard Oil”), have entered into an amended and restated limited liability company agreement for Mardi Gras that provides us with a 65% managing member interest in Mardi Gras and BP Pipelines and Standard Oil retained a 34% and a 1% interest in Mardi Gras, respectively. Our 65% managing member interest gives us the right to control Mardi Gras, including the right to vote Mardi Gras’ ownership interest in each of the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures. Mardi Gras owns a 56% interest in Caesar, a 65% interest in Proteus, a 65% interest in Endymion, and a 53% interest in Cleopatra.
Caesar.

General. Caesar is approximately 115 miles of 24- and 28-inch pipeline with an approximate capacity of 450 kbpd connecting platforms in the Southern Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico with the two connecting carrier pipelines (Cameron Highway and Poseidon) for ultimate transportation to shore. Caesar is designed not only to meet the needs of the original BP-operated Green Canyon area platforms, but also to accommodate new connections for growing production in the area. The Green Canyon area serviced by Caesar is a high-growth area of the Gulf of Mexico and includes the Holstein platform (“Holstein”) operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation ("Anadarko"), the BP-operated Mad Dog platform (“Mad Dog”), the BP-operated Atlantis platform (“Atlantis”), the BHP Billiton Ltd ("BHP")-operated Neptune platform (“Neptune”) and the recently connected Anadarko-operated Heidelberg platform (“Heidelberg”). Caesar is expected to transport new volumes from Mad Dog 2 once it comes online, which anticipated to be in 2021. New volumes can enter the pipeline through either subsea tie-backs to currently connected platforms or by connecting to one of three existing and available subsea connections located in the Green Canyon area.

Ownership and Operatorship. We own a 65% managing member interest in Mardi Gras, which owns a 56% interest in Caesar, and unaffiliated third-party investors own the remaining 44%. BP Pipelines operated Caesar on behalf of BP, until the beginning of the third quarter of 2017, when an affiliate of Shell became the operator of Caesar. Under the Caesar limited liability company agreement, Caesar is managed by a management committee that has full power and authority to manage the entire business and affairs of the Caesar pipeline system and oversee the operations of the Caesar operators. All decisions of the management committees require the vote of two or more members that are not affiliates holding at least 61% of the ownership interests in Caesar, except for certain significant actions, including approving significant capital expenditures, that require the vote of members representing at least 70% of the ownership interests, and certain fundamental actions, including authorizing the merger, consolidation or dissolution of the company, each of which requires the vote of members representing 100% of the ownership interests.

The Caesar limited liability company agreement provides for cash distributions to the members from time to time, and the management committee may from time to time issue capital call notices to the members. Under the Caesar limited liability company agreement, each member’s interest is subject to transfer restrictions, including a minimum credit rating requirement for potential transferees. Subject to certain exceptions, the Caesar limited liability company agreement provides that the company’s existence shall continue indefinitely unless dissolved earlier pursuant to the vote of a unanimous interest.

Customers. Caesar maintains a growing set of well-established customers, including BP. Caesar is connected to the Mad Dog, Atlantis, Holstein, Neptune and Heidelberg production platforms.

Contracts. Since Caesar is not FERC-regulated under the ICA, in order to ship on Caesar, an oil transportation agreement is negotiated to cover transportation service. Pursuant to any such oil transportation agreement, shippers are generally required to 
15

dedicate the production from the fields to Caesar for the life of the applicable lease as a way to ensure the production moves on Caesar.

Cleopatra.

General. Cleopatra is an approximately 115 mile, 16- and 20-inch gas gathering pipeline system with an approximate capacity of 500 MMscf/d and provides gathering and transportation for multiple gas producers in the Southern Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico to the Manta Ray pipeline, which in turn connects to the Nautilus pipeline for ultimate transportation to shore. Cleopatra is designed not only to meet the needs of the original BP-operated Green Canyon area platforms, but also to accommodate new connections for growing production in the area. Cleopatra is currently connected to Holstein, Atlantis and Mad Dog. The system is expected to transport new volumes from Mad Dog 2 once it comes online, which is anticipated to be in 2021. Additionally, Neptune and the BHP-operated Shenzi platform (“Shenzi”) have access through third-party pipelines into Cleopatra. The BP operated Atlantis platform is a moored floating facility that can produce up to 200,000 barrels of oil and 180 million cubic feet of gas per day. The BP operated Mad Dog platform is a floating spar facility that can produce up to 80,000 barrels of oil and 60 million cubic feet of gas per day.

Ownership and Operatorship. We own a 65% managing member interest in Mardi Gras, which owns a 53% interest in Cleopatra, and unaffiliated third-party investors own the remaining 47%. BP Pipelines operated Cleopatra on behalf of BP, until the beginning of the third quarter of 2017, when an affiliate of Shell became the operator of Cleopatra. Under the Cleopatra limited liability company agreement, Cleopatra is managed by a management committee that has full power and authority to manage the entire business and affairs of the Cleopatra pipeline systems and oversee the operations of the Cleopatra operators. All decisions of the management committee require the vote of two or more members that are not affiliates holding at least 61% of the ownership interests in Cleopatra, except for certain significant actions, including approving significant capital expenditures, that require the vote of members representing at least 70% of the ownership interests, and certain fundamental actions, including authorizing the merger, consolidation or dissolution of the company, each of which requires the vote of members representing 100% of the ownership interests.

The Cleopatra limited liability company agreement provides for cash distributions to the members from time to time, and the management committee may from time to time issue capital call notices to the members. Under the Cleopatra limited liability company agreement, each member’s interest is subject to transfer restrictions, including a minimum credit rating requirement for potential transferees. Subject to certain exceptions, the Cleopatra limited liability company agreement provides that the company’s existence shall continue indefinitely unless dissolved earlier pursuant to the vote of a unanimous interest.

Customers. Cleopatra maintains a growing set of well-established customers, including BP. Cleopatra is connected to the Mad Dog, Atlantis, Holstein, Neptune and Shenzi production platforms.

Contracts. Since Cleopatra is not FERC-regulated under the NGA, in order to ship on Cleopatra, a gas gathering agreement is negotiated to cover transportation service. Pursuant to any such gas gathering agreement, shippers are generally required to dedicate the production from the fields to Cleopatra for the life of the applicable lease as a way to ensure the production moves on Cleopatra.

Proteus.

General. Proteus is an approximately 70 mile, 24- and 28-inch crude oil pipeline system with an approximate capacity of 425 kbpd and provides transportation into Endymion for multiple crude oil producers in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The pipeline provides takeaway capacity for the BP-operated Thunder Horse and Noble Energy-operated Thunder Hawk platforms to the Proteus SP 89E Platform. Noble’s Big Bend and Dantzler fields are connected to the Thunder Hawk platform. An affiliate of Shell is currently building the Mattox pipeline which will connect to Proteus. Through this upstream connection, Proteus will transport all of the volumes from Shell’s Appomattox platform. Proteus is also constructing a new connecting platform adjacent to SP 89E platform that will accommodate volumes from the Mattox pipeline. In addition, the new Proteus platform will provide space for future pumping equipment and the ability to increase the capacity of the Proteus system to over 700 kbpd.

Ownership and Operatorship. We own a 65% managing member interest in Mardi Gras, which owns a 65% interest in Proteus. Certain unaffiliated third-party investors own a 10% and 25% interest, respectively, in Proteus. BP Pipelines operated Proteus on behalf of BP, until the beginning of the third quarter of 2017, when an affiliate of Shell became the operator of Proteus. Under the Proteus limited liability company agreement, Proteus is managed by a management committee that has authority to manage the business and affairs of the Proteus pipeline system. All decisions of the management committee requires the vote of two or more members that are not affiliates holding at least 60% of the ownership interests in Proteus, except for certain significant actions, such as approving significant capital expenditures, that require the vote of members representing at least 76% of the 
16

ownership interests, and certain fundamental actions, such as authorizing the merger, consolidation or dissolution of the company, that require the vote of members representing 100% of the ownership interests.

The Proteus limited liability company agreement provides for cash distributions to the members from time to time, and the management committees may from time to time issue capital call notices to the members. Under the Proteus limited liability company agreements, each member’s interest is subject to transfer restrictions, including a right of first refusal in favor of the other members. Subject to certain exceptions, the Proteus limited liability company agreements provide that the company’s existence shall continue indefinitely unless dissolved earlier pursuant to the vote of a unanimous interest.

Customers. Proteus maintains a growing set of well-established customers, including BP. Proteus is connected to the Thunder Horse and Thunder Hawk production platforms. Thunder Hawk is also connected to the Big Bend and Dantzler producing fields via a subsea tie-back. The BP Thunder Horse platform is BP’s largest in the Gulf of Mexico, with production capacity of 250 kbpd and 200 MMscf/d.

Contracts. Since Proteus is not FERC-regulated under the ICA, in order to ship on Proteus, an oil transportation agreement is negotiated to cover transportation service. Pursuant to any such oil transportation agreement, shippers are generally required to dedicate the production from the fields to Proteus for the life of the applicable lease as a way to ensure the production moves on Proteus.

Endymion.

General. Endymion is an approximately 90 mile, 30-inch crude oil pipeline system which originates downstream of the Proteus SP 89E Platform with an approximate current capacity of 425 kbpd and provides transportation for multiple oil producers in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Endymion receives 100% of volumes transported on Proteus and is connected to the LOOP storage complex. Endymion leases a cavern from LOOP LLC, which provides it with additional operational flexibility and protection for its operations from extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes. The Proteus SP89E Platform will have a connection with the Mattox pipeline as well as the current connection to the Proteus Pipeline. Proteus is connected to the Thunder Horse and Thunder Hawk production platforms. Thunder Hawk is also connected via subsea tie-backs to Big Bend and Dantzler producing fields. BP is the operator and has a 75% interest in Thunder Horse, which commenced production in 2008.

Ownership and Operatorship. We own a 65% managing member interest in Mardi Gras, which owns a 65% interest in Endymion, and unaffiliated third-party investors own the remaining 35%. BP Pipelines operated Endymion on behalf of BP, until the beginning of the third quarter of 2017, when an affiliate of Shell became the operator of Endymion. Under the Endymion limited liability company agreement, Endymion is managed by a management committee that has authority to manage the business and affairs of the Endymion pipeline system. All decisions of the management committee requires the vote of two or more members that are not affiliates holding at least 60% of the ownership interests in Endymion, except for certain significant actions, including approving significant capital expenditures, that require the vote of members representing at least 76% of the ownership interests, and certain fundamental actions, including authorizing the merger, consolidation or dissolution of the companies, each of which requires the vote of members representing 100% of the ownership interests. 
The Endymion limited liability company agreement provides for cash distributions to the members from time to time, and the management committee may from time to time issue capital call notices to the members. Under the Endymion limited liability company agreement, each member’s interest is subject to transfer restrictions, including a right of first refusal in favor of the other members. Subject to certain exceptions, the Endymion limited liability company agreement provides that the company’s existence shall continue indefinitely unless dissolved earlier pursuant to the vote of a unanimous interest.

Customers. Endymion maintains a growing set of well-established customers, including BP. Endymion is connected to Proteus, which receives volumes from the Thunder Horse, Thunder Hawk, Big Bend, and Dantzler production platforms via the Proteus Pipeline.

Contracts. Since Endymion is not FERC-regulated under the ICA, in order to ship on Endymion, an oil transportation agreement is negotiated to cover transportation service. Pursuant to any such oil transportation agreement, shippers are generally required to dedicate the production from the fields to Endymion for the life of the applicable lease as a way to ensure the production moves on Endymion.
Ursa.
General. Ursa is a pipeline that transports crude oil production from a platform located in the Mississippi Canyon area to a connection with the Mars Pipeline at West Delta 143 platform for ultimate transportation to Chevron’s Fourchon terminal and

Our Commercial Agreements with BP

Minimum Volume Commitment Agreements

Our onshore assets provide vital movements to and from, and are integral to the operation of, BP’s Whiting Refinery. We have commercial agreements with BP Products for our onshore pipelines that include minimum volume commitments and support substantially all of our aggregate revenue on BP2, River Rouge and Diamondback. Under these fee-based agreements, we provide 
18

transportation services to BP Products, and BP Products has committed to pay us for minimum volumes of crude oil, refined products and diluent, regardless of whether such volumes are physically shipped by BP Products through our pipelines during the term of the agreements.

Pipeline | Period | MinimumThroughput Commitment (kbpd) | TransportationFee Rate
BP2 | Q4 2017 - 2018 | 303 | | Posted Tariff
BP2 | 2019 | 310 | | Posted Tariff
BP2 | 2020 | 320 | | Posted Tariff
River Rouge | Q4 2017 - 2020 | 60 | | Posted Tariff
Diamondback | Q3 2017 - Q2 2020 | 23 | | Posted Tariff
Diamondback | Q4 2017 - 2020 | 20 | | Posted Tariff

Under each of our throughput and deficiency, or “minimum volume commitment,” agreements, BP Products is obligated to throughput certain minimum volumes of crude oil, refined products and diluent on our onshore pipelines and pay the applicable tariff rates with respect to such volumes. The following sets forth additional information regarding each of our minimum volume commitment agreements:

BP2 Throughput and Deficiency Agreement. Under this agreement, if BP Products fails to transport its minimum throughput volume on our BP2 pipeline from Griffith, Indiana to the Whiting Refinery during any month through December 31, 2020, then BP Products will pay us a deficiency payment equal to the volume of the deficiency multiplied by the contractual rate, which is calculated based on the applicable tariff rate then in effect. The amount of any deficiency payment paid by BP Products under this agreement may be applied as a credit for any volumes transported on our BP2 pipeline in excess of BP Products’ minimum volume commitment during the calendar year in which such credits arose, after which time any unused credits will expire.

River Rouge Throughput and Deficiency Agreement. Under this agreement, if BP Products fails to transport its minimum throughput volume on River Rouge from Whiting, Indiana to various terminals along the pipeline during any month through December 31, 2020, then BP Products will pay us a deficiency payment equal to the volume of the deficiency multiplied by the contractual deficiency rate which is calculated based on the applicable tariff rates then in effect (the “Deficiency Payment”). The amount of any Deficiency Payment paid by BP Products under this agreement may be applied as a credit for any volumes transported on River Rouge in excess of BP Products’ minimum volume commitment during the calendar year in which such credits arose, after which time any unused credits will expire.

Diamondback Throughput and Deficiency Agreements. We are a party to two throughput and deficiency agreements with BP Products for Diamondback. Under the first such agreement, if BP Products fails to transport its minimum throughput volume on our Diamondback pipeline from Gary, Indiana to Manhattan, Illinois during any of the twelve month periods beginning on July 1, 2017 and each successive anniversary thereafter through June 30, 2020, then BP Products will pay us, during such period, a Deficiency Payment equal to the volume of the deficiency multiplied by the contractual rate, which is calculated based on the applicable tariff rate then in effect. Under the second such agreement, effective October 30, 2017, if BP Products fails to transport its minimum throughput volume on our Diamondback pipeline from Gary, Indiana to Manhattan, Illinois during any month through December 31, 2020, then BP Products will pay us a deficiency payment equal to the volume of the deficiency multiplied by the contractual rate, which is calculated based on the applicable tariff rate then in effect. The amount of any deficiency payment paid by BP Products under this agreement may be applied as a credit for any volumes transported on our Diamondback pipeline in excess of BP Products’ minimum volume commitment during the calendar year in which such credits arose, after which time any unused credits will expire.

Termination of Throughput and Deficiency Agreements. BP Products has the right to terminate these agreements if we fail to perform any of our material obligations and fail to correct such non-performance within specified periods, or, for the agreements that run through December 31, 2020, in the event of a change of control of our general partner.

BP Products is not permitted to suspend or reduce its obligations under these agreements in connection with the shutdown of the Whiting Refinery for any reason other than certain force majeure events, including for scheduled turnarounds or other regular servicing or maintenance.

Under these agreements, if a force majeure event occurs and renders us or BP Products unable to meet our respective obligations under the agreement and continues for 365 consecutive days or more, then the party not claiming non-performance due to such force majeure event shall have the right to terminate the agreement on no less than 30 days’ prior written notice to the other party.

Right of First Offer

We have entered into an omnibus agreement with BP Pipelines under which BP Pipelines granted us a ROFO, for a period ending on the earlier of (i) seven years after the IPO or (ii) the date on which BP Pipelines or its affiliates cease to control our general partner, to acquire BP Pipelines’ retained ownership interest in Mardi Gras and all of BP Pipelines’ interests in midstream pipeline systems and assets related thereto in the contiguous United States and offshore Gulf of Mexico that were owned by BP Pipelines at the closing of the IPO. In addition to BP Pipelines’ retained ownership interest in Mardi Gras, the assets subject to our ROFO include three crude oil and natural gas liquid pipeline systems with an aggregate gross length of approximately 1,550 miles and an aggregate gross capacity of approximately 1,800 kbpd and nine refined products pipeline systems with an aggregate gross length of approximately 1,940 miles and an aggregate gross capacity of approximately 620 kbpd, as of December 31, 2018.

The consideration to be paid by us for the Subject Assets, as well as the consummation and timing of any acquisition by us of those assets, would depend upon, among other things, the timing of BP Pipelines’ decision to sell those assets and our ability to successfully negotiate a price and other mutually agreeable purchase terms for those assets. Please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we are unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms from BP or third parties, our future growth would be limited, and any acquisitions we may make may reduce, rather than increase, our cash flows and ability to make distributions to unitholders.
Our Relationship with BP 

BP is one of the world’s largest integrated energy businesses in terms of market capitalization and operating cash flow. BP is a leading producer and transporter of onshore and offshore hydrocarbons as well as a major refiner in the United States. BP is one of the largest crude oil and natural gas producers in the Gulf of Mexico and is currently developing deepwater prospects and associated infrastructure. In addition to its offshore production, BP has significant onshore exploration and production interests and produces crude oil and natural gas throughout North America. BP’s downstream portfolio includes interests in refineries throughout the United States with a combined refining capacity of approximately 746 kbpd. 

BP’s portfolio of midstream assets consists of key infrastructure required to transport and/or store crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent for BP and third parties. BP Pipelines’ ownership interests in midstream assets in the U.S. include approximately 4,610 miles of crude oil, refined products, diluent and natural gas pipeline systems that transports approximately 2,070 kbpd to refineries, refined products terminals, connecting pipelines and natural gas processing plants. In addition, BP has substantial midstream assets across the globe that may be candidates for contribution to us in the future depending on strategic fit and tax and regulatory characteristics. 

BP Pipelines is BP’s principal midstream subsidiary in the United States. BP Pipelines indirectly owns our general partner, a majority of our limited partner interests and all of our incentive distribution rights. As a result, we believe BP is motivated to promote and support the successful execution of our business strategies, including using our partnership as a growth vehicle for its midstream assets. BP has an expansive portfolio of midstream infrastructure assets, including additional interests in our assets, which could contribute to our future growth if acquired by us. We may also pursue growth projects and acquisitions jointly with BP, including BP Pipelines. 

In addition, BP may also contract with our pipelines for transportation services for any production relating to future onshore developments and deepwater prospects that it develops. Although BP has granted us a ROFO on the Subject Assets, BP is not under any obligation; however, to sell us the Subject Assets or to offer to sell us any other assets, to pursue acquisitions jointly with us or contract with us for transportation services, and we are under no obligation to buy any additional assets from them, to pursue any joint acquisitions with them or offer them additional transportation services. 
Payment of Administrative Fee and Reimbursement of Expenses
Under the omnibus agreement, we initially agreed to pay BP Pipelines an administrative fee of $13.3 million annually (payable in equal monthly installments), to reimburse BP Pipelines and its affiliates for the provision of certain general and administrative services for our benefit, including services related to the following areas: executive management services; financial management and administrative services (such as treasury and accounting); information technology services; legal services; health, safety and environmental services; land and real property management services; human resources services; procurement services; corporate engineering services; business development services; investor relations, communications and external affairs; insurance administration and tax related services.

Under this agreement, we initially agreed to also reimburse BP Pipelines and its affiliates for all other direct or allocated costs and expenses incurred by BP Pipelines in providing these services to us, including personnel costs related to the direct operation, 
20

management, maintenance and repair of the assets. This reimbursement is in addition to our reimbursement of our general partner and its affiliates for certain costs and expenses incurred on our behalf for managing and controlling our business and operations as required by our partnership agreement.

The fee was adjusted to $13.6 million per year, payable in equal monthly installments, beginning on January 1, 2019. Our general partner, in good faith, may adjust the administrative fee to reflect, among others, any change in the level or complexity of our operations, a change in the scope or cost of services provided to us, inflation or a change in law or other regulatory requirements, the contribution, acquisition or disposition of our assets or any material change in our operation activities.
Customers
BP is our primary customer. Total revenue from BP represented 97.6%, 98.0%, and 95.3% of our revenues in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. BP’s volumes represented approximately 94.9%, 95.3% and 95.2% of the aggregate total volumes transported on the Wholly Owned Assets for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
In addition, we transport crude oil, natural gas and diluent for a mix of third-party customers, including crude oil producers, refiners, marketers and traders, and our assets are connected to other crude oil, natural gas and diluent pipeline systems. In addition to serving directly connected Midwestern U.S. and Gulf Coast markets, our pipelines have access to customers in various regions of the United States and Canada through interconnections with other major pipelines. Our customers use our transportation services for a variety of reasons. Producers of crude oil require the ability to deliver their product to market and frequently enter into firm transportation contracts to ensure that they will have sufficient capacity available to deliver their product to delivery points with greatest market liquidity. Marketers and traders generate income from buying and selling crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent to capitalize on price differentials over time or between markets. Our customer mix can vary over time and largely depends on the crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent supply and demand dynamics in our markets.
Competition 

Our pipelines face competition from a variety of alternative transportation methods including rail, water borne movements including barging and shipping, trucking and other pipelines that service the same markets as our pipelines. Competition for BP2 and River Rouge common carrier pipelines is based primarily on connectivity to sources of supply and demand. Both of these lines are integral to the Whiting Refinery and there are a limited number of competitors providing similar services. For example, BP2 provides the primary supply of crude oil (including heavy crude) to the Whiting Refinery, and River Rouge is the sole source of refined products for three of the five third-party terminals along its route to the Detroit refined products market. We believe that Diamondback offers a unique level of service to our customers for diluent that moves to Canada on a third-party pipeline connected to the delivery point of Diamondback. However, Diamondback competes with one or more pipelines for Gulf Coast sourced diluent, including certain recently completed pipelines, which have direct connections in Manhattan, Illinois and which may develop additional access to Western Canadian producers in the future. Our terminals compete for throughput and storage opportunities in the geographic areas in which they operate.

Competition for refined products in the Midwest is affected by supply and demand. Supply is driven by the volume of products produced by refineries in that area, the availability of products to get transported to the area and the cost of transportation to that area from other geographies. As a result of our affiliate relationships and the scope and scale of our refined products pipeline system, we believe that our refined product pipeline will not face significant new competition in the near-term. 
Even though our offshore lines are supported by fee-based life-of-lease transportation agreements, our offshore pipeline compete for new production on the basis of geographic proximity to the production, cost of connection, available capacity, transportation rates and access to onshore markets. The principal competition for our offshore pipeline includes other crude oil and natural gas pipeline systems as well as producers who may elect to build or utilize their own transportation assets, although the barrier to new entrants is high due to the cost and environmental permitting required. In addition, the ability of our offshore pipelines to access future reserves will be subject to our ability, or the producers’ ability, to fund the significant capital expenditures required to connect to the new production. In general, except for Mars, our offshore pipelines are not currently subject to regulatory rate-making authority, and the rates our offshore pipeline charges for services are dependent on market and economic conditions.
FERC and Common Carrier Regulations 

Our common carrier pipeline systems are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. 

21

FERC regulates interstate transportation on our common carrier refined products, diluent, and crude oil pipeline systems under the ICA as modified by the Elkins Act, the EPAct and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. FERC regulations require that rates and terms and conditions of service for interstate service pipelines that transport crude oil, refined products and diluent (collectively referred to as “petroleum pipelines”) and certain other liquids, be just and reasonable and must not be unduly discriminatory or confer any undue preference upon any shipper. FERC’s regulations also require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service. 

Under the ICA, FERC or interested persons may challenge either existing or proposed new or changed rates, services, or terms and conditions of service. FERC is authorized to investigate such charges and may suspend the effectiveness of a new rate for up to seven months. Under certain circumstances, FERC could limit a common carrier pipeline’s ability to charge rates until completion of an investigation during which FERC could find that the new or changed rate is unlawful. In contrast, FERC has clarified that initial rates and terms of service agreed upon with committed shippers in a transportation services agreement are not subject to protest or a cost-of-service analysis where the pipeline held an open season offering all potential shippers service on the same terms. 
A successful rate challenge could result in a common carrier pipeline paying refunds of revenue collected in excess of the just and reasonable rate, together with interest for the period, if any, that the rate was in effect. FERC may also order a pipeline to reduce its rates prospectively, and may require a common carrier pipeline to pay shippers reparations retroactively for rate overages for a period of up to two years prior to the date the complaint was filed. FERC also has the authority to change terms and conditions of service if it determines that they are unjust or unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential. We may at any time also be required to respond to governmental requests for information, including compliance audits conducted by FERC. 
EPAct required FERC to establish a simplified and generally applicable methodology to adjust tariff rates for inflation for interstate petroleum pipelines. As a result, FERC adopted an indexing rate methodology which, as currently in effect, allows common carriers to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the PPI. The indexing methodology is applicable to existing rates, with the exclusion of market-based rates. FERC’s indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. During the five-year period commencing July 1, 2016 and ending June 30, 2021, common carriers charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by PPI plus 1.23%. We cannot predict whether or to what extent the index factor may change in the future. As discussed below, FERC’s March 15, 2018 Revised Policy on Treatment of Income Taxes (“Revised Policy Statement”) proposes to reflect the effects of its new policy in the 2020 five-year review. A pipeline is not required to raise its rates up to the index ceiling, but it is permitted to do so. Rate increases made under the index are presumed to be just and reasonable and require a protesting party to demonstrate that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs. Despite these procedural limits on challenging the indexing of rates, the overall rates are not entitled to any specific protection against rate challenges. Under the indexing rate methodology, in any year in which the index is negative, pipelines must file to lower their rates if those rates would otherwise be above the rate ceiling. 

On October 20, 2016, FERC issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Revisions to Indexing Policies and Page 700 of FERC Form No. 6 (the “ANOPR”). If final rules are implemented as proposed in the ANOPR, then FERC would implement new tests for whether our pipelines providing service subject to FERC tariffs could increase rates in accordance with the FERC index in a given year and the new tests could restrict our ability to increase our rates as a result. The outcome of this proceeding is currently uncertain, as is the timing of its resolution. 

While common carrier pipelines often use the indexing methodology to change their rates, common carrier pipelines may elect to support proposed rates by using other methodologies such as cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates, and settlement rates. A common carrier pipeline can propose a cost-of-service approach when seeking to increase its rates above the rate ceiling (or when seeking to avoid lowering rates to the reduced rate ceiling), but must establish that a substantial divergence exists between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rates resulting from application of the indexing methodology. A common carrier can charge market based rates if it establishes that it lacks significant market power in the affected markets. A common carrier can change existing rates under settlement if agreed upon by all current shippers. Initial rates for a new service on a common carrier pipeline can be established through a negotiated rate with an unaffiliated shipper, but if challenged must be supported by a cost of service. 

The rates shown in our tariffs have been established using a cost-of-service methodology, by settlement or contract negotiation, by indexing, or by a combination of these methods. If we used cost-of-service rate making to establish or support our rates on our different pipeline systems, the issue of the proper allowance for federal and state income taxes could arise. FERC utilizes an indexing rate methodology which, as currently in effect, allows common carriers to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the PPI. The indexing methodology is applicable to existing rates, with the exclusion of market-
22

based rates. FERC’s indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. During the five-year period commencing July 1, 2016 and ending June 30, 2021, common carriers charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by PPI plus 1.23%. Many existing pipelines, including BP2, River Rogue, Diamondback, and Mars, utilize the FERC oil index to change transportation rates annually every July 1. 
On March 15, 2018, in a set of related issuances, FERC addressed treatment of federal income tax allowances in regulated entity rates. To the extent a regulated entity is permitted to include an income tax allowance in its cost-of-service, FERC directed entities to calculate the income tax allowance at the reduced 21% maximum corporate tax rate established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. FERC also issued the Revised Policy Statement stating that it will no longer permit MLPs to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates. FERC issued the Revised Policy Statement in response to a remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in United Airlines v. FERC, in which the court determined that FERC had not justified its conclusion that a pipeline organized as a MLP would not “double recover” its taxes under the current policy by both including an income-tax allowance in its cost-of-service and earning a return on equity calculated using the discounted cash flow methodology. Specifically with respect to oil and refined products pipelines subject to FERC jurisdiction, FERC requires the pipeline to reflect the impacts to their cost of service from the Revised Policy Statement and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on the Page 700 of FERC Form No. 6. This information will be used by FERC in its next five-year review of the oil pipeline index to generate the index level to be effective July 1, 2021, thereby including the effect of the Revised Policy Statement and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the determination of indexed rates prospectively, effective July 1, 2021. FERC’s establishment of a just and reasonable rate, including the determination of the appropriate oil pipeline index, is based on many components, and tax-related changes will affect two such components, the allowance for income taxes and the amount for accumulated deferred income taxes, while other pipeline costs also will continue to affect FERC’s determination of the appropriate pipeline index. Accordingly, depending on FERC’s application of its indexing rate methodology for the next five-year term of index rates, the Revised Policy Statement and tax effects related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may impact our revenues associated with any transportation services we may provide pursuant to cost-of-service based rates in the future, including indexed rates. While management continues to evaluate the Income Tax Allowance Order, we do not expect this to have a material impact on our tariffs or our cash available for distribution.

Intrastate services provided by certain of our pipeline systems are subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities, such as the Louisiana Public Service Commission, which currently regulates Mars. State agencies typically require intrastate petroleum pipelines to file their rates with the agencies and permit shippers to challenge existing rates and proposed rate increases. State agencies may also investigate rates, services, and terms and conditions of service on their own initiative. State regulatory commissions could limit our ability to increase our rates or to set rates based on our costs or order us to reduce our rates and require the payment of refunds to shippers. 

If our rate levels were investigated by FERC or a state commission, the inquiry could result in an investigation of our costs, including: 

• | the overall cost of service, including operating costs and overhead;


• | the allocation of overhead and other administrative and general expenses to the regulated entity;


• | the appropriate capital structure to be utilized in calculating rates;


• | the appropriate rate of return on equity and interest rates on debt;


• | the rate base, including the proper starting rate base;


• | the throughput underlying the rate; and


• | the proper allowance for federal and state income taxes.

FERC or a state commission could order us to change our rates, services, or terms and conditions of service or require us to pay shippers reparations, together with interest and subject to the applicable statute of limitations, if it were determined that an established rate, service, or terms and conditions of service were unjust or unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential. 

The FERC implements the OCSLA pertaining to transportation and pipeline issues, which requires that all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf provide non-discriminatory transportation service. The Caesar, Cleopatra, Proteus, and portions of Endymion, Mars and Ursa pipelines are located in the Outer Continental Shelf and are subject to the non-discrimination requirements in the OCSLA.
Safety

Our assets are subject to stringent safety laws and regulations. Our transportation of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent involves a risk that hazardous liquids or flammable gases may be released into the environment, potentially causing harm to the public or the environment. In turn, such incidents may result in substantial expenditures for response actions, significant government penalties, liability to government agencies for natural resources damages, and significant business interruption. 
23

PHMSA of DOT has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and management of our assets. BSEE of DOI has adopted similar regulations for offshore pipelines under its jurisdiction. These regulations contain requirements for the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection and testing of pipelines and necessary maintenance or repairs. These regulations also require that pipeline operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans.

Pipeline safety laws and regulations are subject to change over time. Changes in existing laws and regulations could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects, or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which could result in our incurring increased operating costs that could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. For example, PHMSA has announced that it anticipates the issuance of the Hazardous Liquids Pipelines Integrity Management final rule in 2019. The rule was originally released in 2017; however, the requirements for regulatory reduction put in place by the current administration delayed this rule from publication in the federal register and the rule coming into effect. Based on the rule released in 2017, the 2019 final rulemaking will likely address topics such as: inspections of pipelines following extreme weather events, periodic assessment of pipelines not currently subject to integrity management, repair criteria, expanded use of leak detection systems, increased use of in-line inspection tools and other requirements. PHMSA is also expected to propose significant revisions to its gas pipeline rules over the course of the next several years, including expanding requirements for risk assessments and maximum allowable operating pressure, expansion of integrity management requirements to previously non-regulation pipelines, and increased reporting obligations.

For the pipelines we operate, we monitor the structural integrity of our pipelines through a program of periodic internal assessments using high resolution internal inspection tools, as well as hydrostatic testing that conforms to federal standards. We accompany these assessments with a review of the data and repair anomalies, as required, to ensure the integrity of each pipeline. We compare these inspection and testing results with other inspection data to ensure that the highest risk pipelines receive the highest priority for consideration of additional integrity assessments or repairs. We use external coatings and impressed current cathodic protection systems to protect against external corrosion. We conduct all cathodic protection work in accordance with all state and federal regulations, and we regularly monitor, test, and record the effectiveness of these corrosion inhibiting systems. We operate BP2, Diamondback and River Rouge. 
Mars, Ursa and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures are operated in a similar manner by an affiliate of Shell. KM Phoenix's terminalling assets are operated in a similar manner by an affiliate of Kinder Morgan.
Product Quality Standards

Refined products that we transport are generally sold by our customers for consumption by the public. Various federal, state and local agencies have the authority to prescribe product quality specifications for refined products. Changes in product quality specifications or blending requirements could reduce our throughput volumes, require us to incur additional handling costs or require capital expenditures. For example, different product specifications for different markets affect the fungibility of the refined products in our system and could require the construction of storage. In addition, changes or variations in product specifications of the refined products we receive on our refined product pipeline systems could add operational and scheduling complexity due to movements of additional product segregations on the pipeline. Our inability to recover increased expenditures for infrastructure or operational costs could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows, as well as our ability to make cash distributions.
Security

We are subject to the Transportation Security Administration’s Pipeline Security Guidelines, and some of the pipelines have been identified as Critical Infrastructure Assets. Further, SP-89E associated with Proteus is subject to Maritime Transportation Safety Act requirements through the U.S. Coast Guard. We have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with all of these requirements. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the security of our facilities.

While we are not currently subject to governmental standards for the protection of computer-based systems and technology from cyber threats and attacks, proposals to establish such standards are being considered by the U.S. Congress and by U.S. Executive Branch departments and agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, and we may become subject to such standards in the future. We are currently implementing our own cyber-security programs and protocols; however, we cannot guarantee their effectiveness. A significant cyber-attack could have a material effect on operations and those of our customers.

Environmental Matters 

General.    Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources. Among other things, these laws and regulations govern the emission or discharge of pollutants into or onto the land, air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate and upgrade equipment and facilities. While these laws and regulations affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income, we believe they do not affect our competitive position, as the operations of our competitors are similarly affected. These laws and regulations are subject to changes, or to changes in the interpretation of such laws and regulations, by regulatory authorities, and continued and future compliance with such laws and regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures. Violation of environmental laws, regulations, and permits can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions limiting our operations, investigatory or remedial liabilities or construction bans or delays in the construction of additional facilities or equipment. Additionally, a release of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could, to the extent the event is not insured, subject us to substantial expenses, including costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to resolve claims by third parties for personal injury or property damage, or by the U.S. federal government or state governments for natural resources damages. These impacts could directly and indirectly affect our business and have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. We cannot currently determine the amounts of such future impacts. 

Air Emissions.    Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and its regulations and comparable state and local statutes and regulations in connection with air emissions from our operations. Under these laws, permits may be required before construction can commence on a new source of potentially significant air emissions, and operating permits may be required for sources that are already constructed. These permits may require controls on our air emission sources, and we may become subject to more stringent regulations requiring the installation of additional emission control technologies. 

We cannot predict the potential impact of changes to climate change legislation and regulations to address GHG emissions in the United States on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, however changes in laws, regulations, policies and obligations relating to climate change, including carbon pricing, could impact our assets, costs, revenue generation and growth opportunities. 

Waste Management and Related Liabilities.    To a large extent, the environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations relate to the release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or solid wastes into soils, groundwater, and surface water, and include measures to control pollution of the environment. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. They also require corrective action, including investigation and remediation, at a facility where such waste may have been released or disposed. 

CERCLA.    The CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or to the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the former and present owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and the transporters and generators of the hazardous substances found at the site. 

Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. In the course of our ordinary operations, we generate waste that falls within CERCLA’s definition of a “hazardous substance” and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites and any natural resource damages. We also may have similar liabilities under state laws comparable to CERCLA. 

RCRA.    We also generate solid wastes, including hazardous wastes, that are subject to the requirements of the federal RCRA and comparable state statutes. From time to time, the EPA and states consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes. Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes. Significant changes in the regulations could increase our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses. 

Hydrocarbon Wastes.    We currently own and lease properties where hydrocarbons are being or for many years have been handled. Over time, hydrocarbons or waste may have been disposed of or released on or under our properties or on or under other locations where hydrocarbons and wastes were taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties and locations have been 
25

operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or wastes was not under our control. These properties and hydrocarbons and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater), or to perform remedial operations to prevent further contamination. 

Indemnity Under the Omnibus Agreement.    Under the omnibus agreement, BP Pipelines will indemnify us for all known and certain unknown environmental liabilities that are associated with the ownership or operation of our assets and due to occurrences on or before October 30, 2017, subject to certain limitations. Indemnification for any unknown environmental liabilities will be limited to liabilities due to occurrences on or before October 30, 2017, which are identified prior to October 30, 2020, and will be subject to an aggregate deductible of $0.5 million before we are entitled to indemnification for losses incurred. Once we meet the deductible, BP Pipelines’ indemnity obligation for environmental claims that are unknown as of October 30, 2017 and litigation claims pending as of October 30, 2017 is capped at $15 million. Indemnification for known environmental liabilities identified in the omnibus agreement is not subject to a deductible; however, BP Pipelines' indemnity obligation for these identified environmental liabilities is capped at $25 million. We will not be indemnified for any spills or releases of hydrocarbons or hazardous materials at our facilities that occur after October 30, 2017, or for any other environmental liabilities resulting from our own operations. In addition, we initially agreed to indemnify BP Pipelines for losses arising out of, or associated with, the ownership, management or operation of the IPO Contributed Assets, whether related to the period before or after October 30, 2017 to the extent BP Pipelines is not required to indemnify us for such losses. Losses for which we will indemnify BP Pipelines pursuant to the omnibus agreement are not subject to a deductible before BP Pipelines is entitled to indemnification. There is no limit on the amount for which we will indemnify BP Pipelines under the omnibus agreement. As a result, we may incur such expenses in the future, which may be substantial. 
Water.    Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants, including crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent. Regulations under the Clean Water Act, OPA-90 and state laws impose regulatory burdens on our operations. The discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”), or a delegated state agency. We obtain discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the Clean Water Act or state laws as needed for maintenance or hydrostatic testing activities. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. 

The transportation of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent over and adjacent to water involves risk and subjects us to the liability provisions of and certain regulations issued pursuant to OPA-90 and related state requirements. Among other requirements, OPA-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. PHMSA and BSEE have promulgated regulations requiring such plans that apply to our onshore and offshore pipelines. With respect to statutory liability, in case of any such release, OPA-90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages. OPA-90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. We operate facilities at which releases of oil and hazardous substances could occur. OPA-90 applies joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses exist, they are limited. As such, a violation of the OPA-90 has the potential to adversely affect our operations. 

Construction or maintenance of our pipelines may impact “waters of the United States.” In June 2015, the EPA and the Corps issued a new rule defining the scope of federal jurisdiction over such waters. The rule has been challenged in court on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of Clean Water Act programs, and, in 2018, the EPA and Corps proposed a revised rule that potential reduces the scope of the 2015 rule. Several groups have already announced their intentions to challenge the proposed rule. Therefore, the scope of jurisdiction under the CWA is uncertain at this time. To the extent the rule is implemented or revised and expands the range of properties subject to the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, certain energy companies could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas, which in turn could reduce demand for our services. Regulatory requirements governing wetlands or river crossings (including associated mitigation projects) may result in the delay of our pipeline projects while we obtain necessary permits and may increase the cost of new projects and maintenance activities. 

Employee Safety.    We are subject to the requirements of the OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. 

26

Endangered Species Act.    The Endangered Species Act restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of our facilities are in areas that may be designated as habitat for endangered species, to date, we have not experienced any material adverse impacts as a result of compliance with the Endangered Species Act. If current or future-listed endangered or threatened species or critical habitat are located in areas of the underlying properties where we wish to conduct development activities associated with construction, such work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service periodically makes determinations on listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The discovery of previously unidentified endangered species or threatened species or the designation and listing of new endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected area. 

National Environmental Policy Act.    Major federal actions, such as the issuance of permits associated with construction, can require the completion of certain reviews under the NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Corps, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. The process involves the preparation of either an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement depending on whether the specific circumstances surrounding the proposed federal action will have a significant impact on the human environment. The NEPA process involves public input through comments which can alter the nature of a proposed project either by limiting the scope of the project or requiring resource-specific mitigation. NEPA decisions can be appealed through the court system by process participants. This process may result in delaying the permitting and development of projects, increase the costs of permitting and developing some facilities and could result in certain instances in the abandonment of proposed projects.
Seasonality 

The crude oil, refined products and diluent transported in our pipelines and stored in our terminals are directly affected by the level of supply and demand for such commodities in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. However, many effects of seasonality on our revenue will be substantially mitigated through the use of our fee based long-term agreements with BP Products that include minimum volume commitments.
Title to Real Property Interests and Permits 

While there are a limited number of fee-owned properties associated with certain of our pipeline assets, substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rights-of-way granted by the apparent record owners of the property and in some instances these rights-of-way are revocable at the election of the grantor. In many instances, lands over which rights-of-way have been obtained are subject to prior liens that may not have been subordinated to the right-of-way, ("ROW") grants. We have obtained permits from public authorities to cross over or under, or to lay facilities in or along, watercourses, county roads, municipal streets, and state highways and, in some instances, these permits are revocable at the election of the grantor. We have also obtained permits from railroad companies to cross over or under lands or rights-of-way, many of which are also revocable at the grantor’s election. In some states and under some circumstances, we have the right to seek the use of eminent domain power to acquire rights-of-way and lands necessary for our common carrier pipelines. 
Insurance

Our assets are either self-insured or insured with third parties for certain property damage, business interruption and third-party liabilities, and such coverage includes sudden and accidental pollution liabilities, in amounts which management believes are reasonable and appropriate, and excludes named windstorm coverage.
Employees
Our operations are conducted through, and our assets are owned by, various subsidiaries. However, neither we nor our subsidiaries have any employees. Our general partner has the sole responsibility for providing the personnel necessary to conduct our operations, whether through directly hiring personnel or by obtaining services of personnel employed by BP, BP Pipelines or third parties, but we sometimes refer to these individuals, for drafting convenience only, in this Annual Report as our employees because they provide services directly to us. These operations personnel primarily provide services with respect to the assets we operate: BP2, River Rouge and Diamondback. Mars, Ursa and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures are operated by an affiliate of Shell. KM Phoenix is operated by an affiliate of Kinder Morgan. Under the omnibus agreement we are required to reimburse BP for all costs attributable to operating personnel services. A portion of the operations personnel who provide services for our onshore assets are represented by labor unions. We consider our labor relations to be good and have not experienced any material work stoppages or other material labor disputes within the last five years.

Pipeline Control Operations

BP2, River Rouge, and Diamondback, which are operated by BP Pipelines' employees, are controlled from a central control center located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The control center operates with a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (“SCADA”) system equipped with computer systems designed to continuously monitor operational data. Monitored data includes pressures, temperatures, gravities, flow rates and alarm conditions. The control center operates remote pumps, motors, and valves associated with the receipt and delivery of crude oil and refined products, and provides for the remote-controlled shutdown of pump stations and valves on the pipeline system. A fully functional back-up operations center is also maintained and routinely operated throughout the year with the aim of ensuring safe, reliable, and compliant operations. Mars, Ursa and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures are operated in a similar manner by an affiliate of Shell. The KM Phoenix storage and terminalling systems are operated by an affiliate of Kinder Morgan.
