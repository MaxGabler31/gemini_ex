History and Development of Seneca Foods Corporation
 
Seneca Foods Corporation (“Seneca” or the “Company”) was founded in 1949 and has evolved through internal growth and strategic acquisitions into a leading provider of packaged fruits and vegetables, with 26 facilities located throughout the United States. The facilities are comprised of plants for packaging, can manufacuting, seed production, a farming operation and a logistical support network. The Company also maintains warehouses which are generally located adjacent to its packaging plants. The Company is incorporated in New York with its headquarters located at 3736 South Main Street, Marion, New York and its telephone number is (315) 926-8100. Its high quality products are primarily sourced from approximately 1,400 American farms. The Company’s product offerings include canned, frozen and bottled produce, and snack chips. Its products are sold under private label as well as national and regional brands that the Company owns or licenses, including Seneca®, Libby’s®, Aunt Nellie’s®, Cherryman®, Green Valley® and READ®. The Company’s fruits and vegetables are sold nationwide by major grocery outlets, including supermarkets, mass merchandisers, limited assortment stores, club stores and dollar stores. The Company also sells its products to foodservice distributors, restaurants chains, industrial markets, other food processors, export customers in over 90 countries and federal, state and local governments for school and other food programs. Additionally, the Company packs canned and frozen vegetables under contract packing agreements.
 
The Company pursues acquisitions when they are strategic and financially additive and meet its overall business needs. In 73 years of operation, the Company has made over 50 strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances that have expanded its leadership in the packaged fruit and vegetable industry. The table below includes some of the acquisitions and divestitures that have been completed in recent years:
 

Date | Significant Event 
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
March 2021 | Acquisition of a processing facility in Berlin, Wisconsin for $7.1 million to aid the Company’s frozen business by expanding freezing capability and adding frozen celery production to the core fruit and vegetable business. 
December 2020 | Divestiture of the prepared foods business, resulting in a gain of $34.8 million. The nature of the prepared foods business was not central to Seneca’s primary business and the sale allowed for the continued focus and investment in the Company’s core fruit and vegetable business. 
November 2020 | Executed an agreement with a co-pack customer to process canned vegetables on a contractual basis, and as part of that arrangment, acquired a plant in Cambria, Wisconsin. As an additional part of the arragement, Seneca acquired two already closed facilities and the equipment therein which was relocated and utilized by existing Seneca facilities in order to improve efficiencies or expand production capacities. Any equipment that was unable to be utilized was disposed of in fiscal year 2021. The idle facilities were acquired with no plans of operation, one of which was sold during fiscal year 2022 and the remaining facility is expected be sold in fiscal year 2023.
October 2019 | The Company ceased production at its fruit processing plant in Sunnyside, Washington but continued to store, case and label products at this facility until late in fiscal year 2020. In February 2020, the Company invested approximately $10 million and contributed the Sunnyside facility to acquire a 49% stake in CraftAg, LLC, a newly formed company which processed hemp. During fiscal yer 2022, the Company's investment was deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired and the carrying value of the investment was written down to $0.

Financial Information about Industry Segments
 
The Company has historically managed its business on the basis of three reportable food packaging segments: (1) fruits and vegetables, (2) prepared food products and (3) snack products. The other category comprises non-food packaging sales which relate to the sale of cans, ends, seed, and outside revenue from the Company's trucking and aircraft operations. During fiscal year 2021, the Company sold its prepared foods business, leaving just two reportable segments along with the other category. The Company’s food operation constituted 98% of total net sales in fiscal year 2022. Canned vegetables represented 84%, frozen vegetables represented 9%, fruit products represented 6%, and chip products represented 1% of the total food packaging net sales. Non-food packaging sales represented 2% of the Company's fiscal year 2022 net sales.
 
Principal products and markets 
 
The Company’s principal products include canned vegetables, frozen vegetables, jarred fruit, and other food products. The products are sold nationwide by major grocery outlets, including supermarkets, mass merchandisers, limited assortment stores, club stores and dollar stores. Additionally, products are sold to food service distributors, restaurant chains, industrial markets, other food packagers, export customers in 90 countries, and federal, state and local governments for school and other feeding programs. Food packaging operations are primarily supported by plant locations in New York, Michigan, Oregon, Wisconsin, Washington, Idaho, Illinois, and Minnesota.

Source and Availability of Raw Materials 
 
We purchase raw materials, including raw produce, steel, ingredients and packaging materials from growers, commodity processors, steel producers and packaging suppliers. Raw materials and other input costs, such as labor, fuel, utilities and transportation, are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors. Fluctuations in commodity prices can lead to retail price volatility and can influence consumer and trade buying patterns. The cost of raw materials, fuel, labor, distribution and other costs related to our operations can increase from time to time significantly and unexpectedly.
 
We experienced material net cost increases for raw materials and other input costs during fiscal year 2022. We attempt to manage cost inflation risks by locking in prices through short-term supply contracts, advance grower purchase agreements, and by implementing cost saving measures. We also attempt to offset rising input costs by raising sales prices to our customers. However, increases in the prices we charge our customers may lag behind rising input costs. Competitive pressures also may limit our ability to quickly raise prices in response to rising costs. To the extent we are unable to avoid or offset any present or future cost increases our operating results could be materially adversely affected.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Company's most significant brand name, Libby's®, is held pursuant to a trademark license granted to the Company in March 1982 and renewable by the Company every 10 years for an aggregate period expiring in March 2081. The original licensor was Libby, McNeill & Libby, Inc., then an indirect subsidiary of Nestlé, S. A. ("Nestlé") and the license was granted in connection with the Company's purchase of certain of the licensor's canned vegetable operations in the United States. Corlib Brands Management, LTD acquired the license from Nestlé during 2006. The license is limited to vegetables which are shelf-stable, frozen, and thermally packaged, and includes the Company's major vegetable varieties – corn, peas and green beans – as well as certain other thermally packaged vegetable varieties and sauerkraut.
 
The Company is required to pay an annual royalty to Corlib Brands, now known as Libby's Brand Holding, Ltd., who may terminate the license for non-payment of royalty, use of the trademark in sales outside the licensed territory, failure to achieve a minimum level of sales under the licensed trademark during any calendar year or a material breach or default by the Company under the agreement (which is not cured within the specified cure period). With the purchase of Signature Fruit Company, LLC, which also uses the Libby’s® brand name, the Company re-negotiated the license agreement and created a new, combined agreement based on Libby’s® revenue dollars for fruits, vegetables, and dry beans. During fiscal year 2021, the Company and Libby’s Brand Holding, Ltd. renegotiated again to remove fruit from the license agreement. A total of $0.1 million was paid as a royalty fee for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.

The Company also sells canned vegetables, frozen vegetables, jarred fruit, and other food products under several other brands for which the Company has obtained registered trademarks, including, Aunt Nellie’s®, CherryMan®, Green Valley®, READ®, Seneca®, and other regional brands.
 
Seasonality
 
While individual vegetables have seasonal cycles of peak production and sales, the different cycles are somewhat offsetting. Minimal food packaging occurs in the Company's last fiscal quarter ending March 31, which is the optimal time for maintenance, repairs and equipment changes in its packaging plants. The supply of commodities, current pricing, and expected new crop quantity and quality affect the timing and amount of the Company’s sales and earnings. When the seasonal harvesting periods of the Company's major vegetables are newly completed, inventories for these packaged vegetables are at their highest levels. For peas, the peak inventory time is mid-summer and for corn and green beans, the Company's highest volume vegetables, the peak inventory is in mid-autumn.
 
The Company’s revenues typically are highest in the second and third fiscal quarters. This is due, in part, because the Company’s fruit and vegetable sales exhibit seasonal increases in the third fiscal quarter due to increased retail demand during the holiday season. In addition, the Company sells canned and frozen vegetables to a co-pack customer on a bill and hold basis at the end of each pack cycle, which typically occurs during these quarters.
 
These seasonal fluctuations are illustrated in the following table, which presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for the periods indicated (in thousands):
 

 | First Quarter | | Second Quarter | | | Third Quarter | | Fourth Quarter

Backlog
 
In the food packaging business, an end of year sales order backlog is not considered meaningful. Traditionally, larger customers provide tentative bookings for their expected purchases for the upcoming season. These bookings are further developed as data on the expected size of the related national harvests becomes available. In general, these bookings serve as a yardstick rather than as a firm commitment, since actual harvest results can vary notably from early estimates. In actual practice, the Company has substantially all of its expected seasonal production identified to potential sales outlets before the seasonal production is completed.
Competition
 
Competition in the packaged food industry is substantial with brand recognition and promotion, quality, service, and pricing being the major determinants in the Company’s relative market position. The Company believes that it is a major producer of canned vegetables, frozen vegetables, and jarred fruit but some producers of these products have sales which exceed the Company's sales. The Company is aware of at least 13 competitors in the U.S. packaged fruit and vegetable industry, many of which are privately held companies.

Environmental Protection
 
Environmental protection is an area that has been worked on diligently at each food packaging facility. In all locations, the Company has cooperated with federal, state, and local environmental protection authorities in developing and maintaining suitable antipollution facilities. In general, we believe our pollution control facilities are equal to or somewhat superior to those of our competitors and are within environmental protection standards. The Company does not expect any material capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations in the near future.
 
There has been a broad range of proposed and promulgated state, national and international regulations aimed at reducing the effects of climate change. In the United States, there is a significant possibility that some form of regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level to address the effects of climate change. Such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, consultant expenses, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances.
 
Environmental Litigation and Contingencies
 
In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is made a party to certain legal proceedings seeking monetary damages, including proceedings involving product liability claims, worker’s compensation and other employee claims, tort and other general liability claims, for which it carries insurance as well as patent infringement and related litigation. The Company is in a highly regulated industry and is also periodically involved in government actions for regulatory violations and other matters surrounding the manufacturing of its products, including, but not limited to, environmental, employee, and product safety issues. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company does not believe that an adverse decision in any of these legal proceedings would have a material adverse impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Employment
 
As of the end of December 2021, the Company had approximately 3,000 employees of which 2,800 are full time, 100 seasonal employees work in food packaging, and 100 full time employees work in other activities. The number of employees increases by approximately 4,000 due to an increase in seasonal employees during our peak pack season.
 
The Company has seven collective bargaining agreements with three unions covering approximately 787 of its full-time employees.  The terms of these agreements result in wages and benefits which are substantially the same for comparable positions for the Company’s non-union employees.  There is one agreement that will expire in calendar 2023, three agreements that will expire in calendar 2024, one agreement that will expire in calendar 2025, one agreement that will expire in calendar 2026, and one agreement that will expire in calendar 2027.
