Item 1.    BUSINESS
Introduction
We are a leading independent manufacturer and distributor of controlled environment agriculture (“CEA”, principally hydroponics) equipment and supplies, including a broad portfolio of our own innovative and proprietary branded products. We primarily serve the U.S. and Canadian markets, and believe we are one of the leading competitors by market share in these markets in an otherwise highly fragmented industry. For over 40 years, we have helped growers make growing easier and more productive. Our mission is to empower growers, farmers and cultivators with products that enable greater quality, efficiency, consistency and speed in their grow projects. For the 2021 fiscal year, we had net sales of $479.4 million. From 2005 through 2021, we generated a net sales compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of approximately 19%.
Hydroponics is the farming of plants using soilless growing media and often artificial lighting in a controlled indoor or greenhouse environment. Hydroponics is the primary category of CEA and we use the terms CEA and hydroponics interchangeably. Our products are used to grow, farm and cultivate cannabis, flowers, fruits, plants, vegetables, grains and herbs in controlled environment settings that allow end users to control key farming variables including temperature, humidity, CO2, light intensity spectrum, nutrient concentration and pH. Through CEA, growers are able to be more efficient with physical space, water and resources, while enjoying year-round and more rapid grow cycles as well as more predictable and abundant grow yields, when compared to other traditional growing methods.
We reach commercial farmers and consumers through a broad and diversified network of over 2,000 wholesale customer accounts, who we connect with primarily through our proprietary e-commerce marketplace. A substantial majority of our net sales are to specialty hydroponic retailers, through which growers are able to enjoy specialized merchandise assortments and knowledgeable staff. We also distribute our products across the United States and Canada to a diversified range of retailers of commercial and home gardening equipment and supplies that include garden centers, hardware stores, e-commerce retailers, commercial greenhouse builders, and commercial resellers.
Business Developments 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed five acquisitions of branded manufacturers of CEA products, resulting in a significant expansion of our portfolio of proprietary branded products and our specialized manufacturing capabilities, including:
•Heavy 16, a manufacturer of plant nutrients and additives, in May 2021;
•House & Garden, a manufacturer of plant nutrients and additives, in June 2021;
•Aurora Innovations, a manufacturer of soil, grow media, plant nutrients and additives, in July 2021;
•Greenstar Plant Products, a manufacturer of plant nutrients and additives, in August 2021; and
•Innovative Growers Equipment, a manufacturer of horticultural benches, racks and grow lights, in November 2021.
We have included additional information about these and other developments in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
How We Serve Our Customers
Our customer value proposition is centered on two pillars. First, we strive to offer the best selection by being a branded provider of all CEA needs. Second, we seek to be the gold standard in distribution and service, leveraging our infrastructure and reach to provide customers with just-in-time (“JIT”) delivery capabilities and exceptional service across the United States and Canada.

The remaining portion of our sales relate to durable products such as hydroponic lighting and equipment. The majority of products we offer are produced by us or are supplied to us under exclusive/preferred brand relationships providing for attractive margins and a significant competitive advantage as we offer retailers and resellers a breadth of products that cannot be purchased elsewhere.
The following graphic illustrates a representative set of our market-leading products across key CEA product categories:
Infrastructure and Reach for Fast Delivery, High In-Stock Availability and Exceptional Service
Our infrastructure and reach enable us to provide delivery and service capabilities to a highly diverse group of customers across the United States and Canada. We believe that our six U.S.-based distribution centers can reach approximately 90% of the U.S. population within 24 to 48 hours and that our two Canadian distribution centers can provide timely coverage to the full Canadian market.
In the United States, we currently operate distribution centers in Fairfield, California; Fontana, California; Gresham, Oregon; Denver, Colorado; Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania; and New Hudson, Michigan. In Canada, we currently have distribution centers in Langley, British Columbia and Cambridge, Ontario. Outside of North America, we operate a distribution center in Zaragoza, Spain, and we have an office for product quality assurance and supply chain management in Shenzhen, China. We partner with a network of third-party logistics companies that facilitate expeditious delivery to our customers across the globe. The majority of customer orders are received through our business-to-business e-commerce platform. Through our differentiated Distributor Managed Inventory (“DMI”) Program, we partner with our network of retailers and resellers to create customized, JIT supply chain solutions for large commercial end users.

In connection with our recent acquisitions, we have acquired manufacturing facilities in the United States in Paramount, California; Arcata, California; Eugene, Oregon; Goshen, New York; and Sycamore, Illinois. In Canada, our manufacturing facilities are in Langley, British Columbia and Edmonton, Alberta.
Since 2005, we have grown our net sales at an approximate 19% CAGR*. This historical growth is largely due to the growth in CEA growing across several end-markets, including cannabis, and our ability to continuously develop, manufacture and distribute innovative branded products on timely basis. 
* Approximately 17% organic net sales growth and 2% M&A growth
TABLE OF CONTENTS

We believe our industry remains poised to grow. Expanding populations, limited natural resources and a focus on the environment and the security of our agricultural systems have illuminated the benefits of CEA compared to traditional outdoor agriculture. We believe the adoption of CEA will continue to accelerate, particularly in the commercial agriculture industry, where CEA can be deployed to achieve results that are simultaneously more efficient for the planet and profitable for growers. The global cannabis industry is a rapidly developing business opportunity for us, particularly as the legal market in the United States continues to expand.
Our Industry Is Large and Growing
The Expanding Controlled Environment Agriculture Market
Our principal industry opportunity is in the wholesale distribution of CEA equipment and supplies, which generally include grow light systems; advanced heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (“HVAC”) systems; humidity and carbon dioxide monitors and controllers; water pumps, heaters, chillers, and filters; nutrient and fertilizer delivery systems; and various growing media typically made from soil, rock wool or coconut fiber, among others. Today, we believe that a majority of our products are sold for use in CEA applications.

CEA is an increasingly significant and fast-growing component of the expansive global commercial agriculture and consumer gardening sectors. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and National Gardening Survey, the agriculture, food, and related industries sector produced more than $1 trillion worth of goods in the United States alone in 2017, and U.S. households spent a record of approximately $48 billion at retail stores on gardening and growing supplies and equipment.
According to industry publications, the global CEA industry totaled approximately $75 billion in 2020, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19% from 2020 to 2025. The rapid growth of CEA crop output will subsequently drive growth in the wholesale CEA equipment and supplies industry. According to industry publications, the global wholesale CEA equipment and supplies industry totaled approximately $9.5 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11% from 2020 to 2026.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Today, we believe that a majority of the CEA equipment and supplies we sell to our customers is ultimately purchased by participants in the cannabis industry, though we do not sell to cannabis growers or to retailers that sell only to the cannabis industry in the United States. The North American cannabis industry is massive and growing, driven largely by state-level legalization efforts in the United States and federal-level legalization in Canada. Although there has been what management believes is a short-term agricultural oversupply that has recently put downward pressure on cannabis growing activity, management believes that the state-level legalization efforts in the United States and increasing popular support (and related positive impacts, as further detailed below) will continue to increase the size of the cannabis market in North America for years to come. 
According to industry publications3, the U.S. cannabis market is projected to reach approximately $47.5 billion by 2026, up from approximately $18.0 billion in 2020, representing an 18% CAGR. In Canada, the cannabis market is projected to reach approximately $6.7 billion by 2024, up from approximately $2.6 billion in 2020, representing a 17% CAGR. 
This significant growth in the U.S. cannabis market is expected due to (i) state initiatives for new adult-use and/or medical-use programs in additional U.S. states, (ii) expanded access for patients or consumers in existing state medical or adult-use cannabis programs, and (iii) increased consumption driven by greater product diversity and choice, reduced stigma, and real and perceived health benefits in states with existing adult-use or medical-use programs.
•State initiatives for new adult-use or medical-use programs. We believe support for cannabis legalization in the United States is gaining momentum. According to a November 2019 poll by Pew Research Center, public support for the legalization of cannabis in the United States increased from approximately 41% in 2010 to approximately 67% in 2019. According to a 2019 poll by Quinnipiac University, 93% of Americans support patient access to medical-use cannabis if recommended by a doctor. Furthermore, due to the recent socio-economic changes across the United States since early 2020, many state government budgets are increasingly under pressure to identify additional revenue sources, such as the potential revenue streams from the taxation and job creation that state legalized adult-use cannabis may offer. Accordingly, a number of states are at various stages of considering implementing laws permitting cannabis use or further liberalizing their existing laws permitting such use. Our sales per capita in U.S. states with legalized adult-use programs are on average several multiples higher than our sales per capita in states without adult-use

programs. We believe this fact points to the significant opportunity available to us if or when additional U.S. states legalize adult-use programs.
•Expanded access for patients and consumers in existing state medical and adult-use programs. The cannabis business in states with existing cannabis laws is in nascent stages in many cases and will continue to grow, creating jobs and opportunities for workers and entrepreneurs. Cultivators, manufacturers, dispensaries, delivery providers, labs and other cannabis-related businesses will continue to grow in these regions. As these businesses proliferate, consumers will benefit from easier access to cannabis products.
•Greater product diversity and choice, reduced stigma and real and perceived health benefits in states with existing adult-use or medical-use programs. Several key developments have contributed to an increase in cannabis product availability and breadth, including the proliferation of cannabidiol (CBD) and other cannabis-infused products, including edibles, oils, tinctures, and topical treatments. We believe that the historical stigmatization of cannabis use has diminished significantly, driven by a more supportive legislative environment, a rise in progressive sociopolitical views and greater consumer awareness of the potential health benefits of cannabis consumption. According to industry publications, real and perceived health benefits extend into areas including cancer treatment, pain management, the treatment of neurological and mental conditions, and sleep management. According to industry publications, the use of cannabis in the United States by adults aged 65+ has increased sharply in recent years from 0.4% in 2006 and 2.9% in 2015 to 4.2% in 2018 (JAMA Internal Medicine). 
Acceleration of CEA Adoption
Both the commercial agriculture and cannabis industries are increasingly adopting more advanced agricultural technologies in order to enhance the productivity and efficiency of operations. The benefits of CEA include:
•Greater product safety, quality and consistency;
•More reliable, climate-agnostic year-round crop supply from multiple, faster harvests per year as opposed to a single, large harvest with outdoor cultivation;
•Lower risk of crop loss from pests (and subsequently lower need for pesticides) and plant disease;
•Lower required water and pesticide use compared to conventional farming, offering incremental benefits in the form of reduced chemical runoff and lower labor requirements; and
•Potentially lower operating expenses from resource-saving technologies such as high-efficiency LED lights, precision nutrient and water systems and automation.
CEA implementation continues to increase globally, driven by the factors listed above as well as growth in fruit and vegetable farming, consumer gardening and the continued adoption of vertical farming. Vertical farming, a subsector of CEA, has gained popularity mainly due to its unique advantage of maximizing yield by growing crops in layers. Industry publications project that the global vertical farming market will reach approximately $6 billion in 2023, up from $3 billion in 2019 and representing a 24% CAGR from 2019 to 2023.
While a small portion of cannabis cultivation may be grown in non-CEA settings, given the multitude of benefits of CEA cultivation, we believe CEA will continue to be the primary method of growing cannabis, driving demand for our products. The movement towards the legalization of cannabis in the United States and its legalization in Canada also comes with a corresponding increase in regulatory oversight and statutory requirements for growers and their products. These regulations enhance product safety and transparency to consumers but usually necessitate the use of CEA in cannabis cultivation in order to meet mandated tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content or impurity tolerances.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Increased Consumer Home Growing
We perceive consumer gardening to be a significant driver of future CEA growth. According to the National Gardening Survey, in 2017, 77% of U.S. households participated in lawn and garden activities, spending on average a record of $503 per household. We expect this growth in consumer gardening and growing spending to continue, driven by both increased participation by millennials and strong continued participation by married households, adults over age 55, and adults without children. We believe that these demographic dynamics will result in an increase in the number of consumer gardening category participants, resulting in the purchase of more CEA products.
Increased Focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Issues
We are committed to ESG responsibilities as we expand our distribution and manufacturing capabilities. We believe the growth and change in our end-markets is in part driven by a variety of ESG trends aimed at preserving resources and enhancing the transparency and safety of our food supply chains. On January 11, 2022, we released our first ESG report to stakeholders, highlighting our continued environmental, health and safety focus and sustainable governance practices. Overall, we believe the CEA market delivers superior performance characteristics versus traditional agriculture . 
COVID-19
The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic has caused significant shifts in consumer sentiment and behavior thereby altering the dynamics of the CEA industry. Vaccines for COVID-19 continue to be administered in the United States and other countries around the world, but the extent and rate of vaccine adoption, the long-term efficacy of these vaccines and other factors remain uncertain. Authorities throughout the world have implemented measures to contain or mitigate the spread of the virus, including physical distancing, travel bans and restrictions, closure of non-essential businesses, quarantines, work-from-home directives, mask requirements, shelter-in-place orders and vaccination programs. The impact of COVID-19 and its variants has been and remains unpredictable. Management believes that COVID-19 has driven a greater volume of sales by our customers in select time periods, thus creating demand for our CEA supplies and equipment. We believe that these changes, as outlined below, will benefit our industry in the long term:
•New entrants into the consumer gardening and growing market. We believe that a meaningful portion of consumer gardening and growing product spending during the COVID-19 outbreak has been driven by first-time users. We expect this to be a tailwind for the consumer gardening and growing market going forward as a portion of these consumers opt to work from home more.
•Increased focus on food security and sustainable sourcing. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified consumer focus on food security and transparency of food production around the world. CEA offers a more sustainable and secure alternative to traditional outdoor agriculture, allowing food to be grown closer to where it is ultimately consumed, thereby reducing supply chain-related risks and food waste.
•Pressure on governments to identify additional revenue streams, such as tax revenue from state legalized cannabis industries. The COVID-19 pandemic has put a significant strain on government budgets, increasing pressure to find revenue from previously unexplored streams including state legalized medical or adult-use cannabis.
•Home-centric lifestyle increasing opportunities for cannabis use. The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to foster a long-term increase in at-home activity. This lifestyle shift may foster growth in the cannabis market by increasing potential occasions for cannabis use as cannabis is often consumed at home.
•Essential service designation. During lockdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, our manufacturing and distribution operations and a great majority of our key suppliers, retailers and resellers were designated as essential and have remained open. This sets a key precedent about the vital importance of our operations and end-markets. Although certain of our key suppliers experienced significant challenges in 2020 and 2021, we believe this precedent will benefit the CEA industry in the long-term.
Our Competitive Strengths
We attribute our success to the following competitive strengths.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Leading Market Positions in Attractive Growing Markets
We are a leading independent manufacturer and distributor of CEA equipment and supplies in the United States and Canada and one of the two major consolidators in the CEA industry. The broader market is comprised of a fragmented group of smaller competitors. We serve several attractive end-markets, including hemp and indirectly the cannabis industry. Favorable trends in CEA, including increased adoption of vertical farming methods to increase yields, are projected to drive a 24% CAGR for the vertical farming market through 2023 according to industry publications. Similarly, growers’ increasing preference to reduce water and energy usage, limit pesticide use and risk of environmental runoff, and reduce labor costs coupled with growing consumer demand for fruits and vegetables are expected to drive significant growth in CEA methods. Furthermore, CEA allows farms to be located closer to their consumers, greatly reducing the costs and waste (namely carbon dioxide and spoiled food) related to transportation resulting in an overall smaller carbon footprint. However, we will likely see the most significant growth in cannabis. Increased support for cannabis legalization at the federal level in the United States, an increase in U.S. states’ implementation of adult-use and medical cannabis programs and increasing popular support will drive future growth.
Experienced Management Team with Proven Track Record
Our management team possesses significant public market experience, a history of driving long-term organic growth and a track record of successful business consolidations. Bill Toler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has over 35 years of executive leadership experience in supply chain and consumer packaged goods, most recently serving as President and Chief Executive Officer of Hostess Brands from April 2014 to March 2018. Under his leadership, Hostess Brands transitioned from a private to public company, regained a leading market position within the sweet baked goods category and returned to profitability. Bill also previously served as Chief Executive Officer of AdvancePierre Foods and President of Pinnacle Foods, in addition to holding executive roles at Campbell Soup Company, Nabisco and Procter & Gamble. Terence Fitch, President, possesses significant relevant business experience including more than 20 years of management experience with the Coca-Cola Company and Coke Enterprises, where he was responsible for manufacturing, supply chain, and sales and marketing for the multi-billion-dollar Refreshment Direct and Independent Bottlers business units. For the past six years, Terence has been working on building, managing and designing large CEA operations in Colorado and Arkansas. B. John Lindeman, Chief Financial Officer, brings us more than 25 years of finance and leadership experience.

Prior to joining Calavo, he held various leadership positions within the finance and investment banking industries at Janney Montgomery Scott, Stifel Nicolaus, Legg Mason and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 
Broad Portfolio with Innovative Proprietary Offerings and Recurring Consumables Sales
We have one of the largest equipment and consumable product offerings in the industry. From lighting solutions to nutrients to grow mediums, we offer nearly everything growers need to ensure their operations are maximizing efficiency, output and quality. We maintain an extensive portfolio of products which includes over 40 internally developed or acquired proprietary brands across thousands of stock keeping units ("SKUs") as well as over 35 exclusive/preferred brands. Approximately 72% of our sales relate to proprietary and exclusive/preferred brands. Our proprietary and exclusive/preferred brands include lighting, equipment, grow media, nutrients and supplements. Our proprietary products command a significant gross margin premium relative to general distributed brands. Our revenue mix continues to shift towards proprietary brands as we continue to innovate, improving overall margins. Further, our revenue stream is highly consistent as, in our estimation, we believe that approximately two-thirds of our net sales are generated from the sale of recurring consumable products including growing media, nutrients and supplies. 
Specialized Manufacturing Capabilities
Following our 2021 acquisitions of five branded manufacturers, we now have specialized manufacturing capabilities as a core competitive strength. Our manufacturing capabilities across seven locations in North America include liquid nutrient blending and bottling, soil blending and bagging, dry fertilizer blending and bagging, worm casting production, perlite production, peat harvesting, metal fabrication, LED surface mounting and light fixture assembly.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Proprietary Sourcing and Supplier Relationships Create Barriers to Entry
Our scale presents a significant barrier to entry as we have developed exclusive distribution relationships, proprietary brands and a geographic footprint that enables us to efficiently service customers across North America. We maintain approximately one million square feet of distribution space across six distribution centers in the United States and two distribution centers in Canada. Following our 2021 acquisitions, we also maintain five manufacturing facilities in the United States and two manufacturing facilities in Canada. Furthermore, we have cultivated over the last 40 years long-term relationships with a network of approximately 400 suppliers, giving us access to a best-in-class products portfolio and allowing us to provide a full range of CEA solutions to our customers. We source individual components from our diverse supplier base to assemble our products, including utilizing a dedicated on-the-ground purchasing team in China to maintain and develop relationships with suppliers. To maintain competitive pricing, we implement cost sharing with certain of our suppliers. One supplier accounted for 10% of purchases in 2021, and another supplier accounted for 10% of purchases in 2019. No supplier accounted for more than 10% of purchases in 2020. 
Unique Ability to Serve Our Strong Customer Base
We maintain long-standing relationships with a diversified range of leading hydroponic retailers, retailers of commercial and home gardening equipment and supplies that include garden centers, hardware stores, e-commerce retailers, commercial greenhouse builders, and commercial resellers. We serve over 2,000 business-to-business customers across multiple channels in North America, providing customers with the capability to purchase their entire product range from us. Our commercial sales and DMI programs further enhance our customer capabilities, offering consultation, technical expertise, facilitated order fulfillment and JIT delivery of consumables. Our unique distribution capabilities allow us to provide JIT delivery across North America, utilizing six strategically located distribution centers in the United States and our two distribution centers in Canada. We believe that our distribution footprint in the United States can reach approximately 90% of the population in 24 to 48 hours and our two distribution centers in British Columbia and Ontario can provide timely coverage to the full Canadian market. We maintain coverage of industry trends and consumer preferences via a robust, seasoned sales organization located regionally across North America complemented by teams made up of specialized product category experts. Given our ability to provide a comprehensive product offering and excellent customer service, we maintain over seven-year relationships with the majority of our largest customers.
Proven Mergers and Acquisitions (“M&A”) Track Record
Our management team has extensive experience with execution and integration of M&A opportunities. In November 2017, we acquired Eddi’s Wholesale Garden Supplies, Ltd. (“Eddi’s”) and the distribution division of Greenstar Plant Products, Inc. Since our initial public offering (“IPO”) in December 2020, we have consummated five acquisitions, including HEAVY 16, House & Garden, Aurora, Greenstar, and Innovative Growers Equipment (as described and each defined below). Our understanding of commercial growers’ needs coupled with our experienced M&A team has enabled us to build a robust pipeline of potential acquisition targets and to convince targets that we should be their partner of choice. We view M&A as a significant driver of potential growth as the hydroponics industry is fragmented and primed for consolidation.
Our Growth and Productivity Strategies
We are well positioned to capitalize on the growth of our underlying markets through the following strategies.
Capitalizing on Rapidly Growing Markets
Our customers benefit from macroeconomic factors driving the growth of CEA, including expanded adoption of CEA and vertical farming by commercial growers and consumers, as well as the growth in cannabis, hemp and other end-markets. As the world population grows and urbanizes, vertical farming is increasingly being used to meet the demand for food crops. Industry publications estimate that the global vertical farming market will expand at a 24% CAGR from 2019 to 2023. In addition, the U.S. and Canadian cannabis markets had an estimated value of approximately $14 billion in 2019, and are projected to grow to $37 billion by 2024. The hemp market has benefited from consumer adoption of hemp-derived CBD products. According to industry publications, the U.S. hemp-derived CBD market is expected to grow from $1.2 billion in 2019 to $6.9 billion in 2025, representing a six-year CAGR of 33.8%. We expect to capitalize on favorable cannabis and hemp growth trends by continuing to expand our operations globally.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Expanding our Proprietary Product Offering
We are expanding the breadth of our product assortment through continued development of our own proprietary brands and acquisitions. Our proprietary brands command a meaningful gross margin premium to our distributed products. Our core competency in new product innovation is in lighting, consumable and equipment categories, and we are enhancing research and development in our other product categories to expand our brand portfolio’s value and further enhance our margins. We have launched several new product lines over the last two years, including PhotoBio LED lighting equipment and Phantom Core HID lighting equipment. Through recent acquisitions, we have expanded our proprietary brands to include HEAVY 16, House & Garden, Mad Farmer, Roots Organics, Soul, Procision, Grotek, Gaia Green, and Innovative Growers Equipment. 
Adding Strategic Distribution Relationships and Exclusive/Preferred Brands
We can increase revenue with significant cross-selling activity to our current installed customer base by offering a more comprehensive assortment of products required by commercial growers to engage in cultivation. We have identified, and in some cases acquired, key suppliers with product solutions that are well established in the grower community for exclusive/preferred brand relationships that continue to drive sales and margin improvement. We believe we are a highly attractive distribution partner due to our scale and independence in growing media and nutrient categories. 
Enabling Wholesaler Network to Effectively Serve Commercial Growers
Working with our wholesale network, we are leveraging our sophisticated technical sales team to provide our wholesale network the ability to address the needs, demanding requirements and higher volume of their larger-scale commercial customers. Establishing these relationships with our channel provides us with insight and access to growers’ evolving demands, leading to both increased equipment sales and recurring sales of consumables through our wholesale network. Our commercial grower outreach program, our analytically driven supply chain function and DMI capabilities enable our wholesaler network to anticipate customer demand for products and ensure their availability. The goal of these efforts is to maintain long-term relationships with our wholesalers by helping them be successful in providing cultivation square footage savings and access to JIT inventory to their customer base. We believe this can result in profitability for our wholesalers’ customers on consumables and equipment. We also believe that increasing the value to our wholesale network will allow us to grow within key accounts and expand sales of our products and services to new accounts.
Productivity Initiatives to Mitigate Costs and Enhance Margins 
We have developed and begun to implement specific productivity initiatives across our business as an additional means of funding growth. We have increased the percentage of proprietary and exclusive/preferred brands and products manufactured internally in our product portfolio. Our innovative proprietary and exclusive/preferred brands offer us a significant margin benefit compared to distributed brands. 
Acquiring Value-Enhancing Businesses
The hydroponics industry is highly fragmented, which we believe presents a significant opportunity for growth through M&A. Management is continually evaluating M&A targets and we believe, in this fragmented market, there will be continued opportunities for M&A. M&A provides us an opportunity to significantly increase distribution with independent brands and to add new products based on identified needs of commercial growers. We utilize clear investment criteria to make disciplined M&A decisions with the goal of accelerating sales and EBITDA growth, increasing competitive strength and market share and expanding our proprietary brand portfolio.
We regularly pursue opportunities to grow our business through acquisitions of strategically complementary businesses and typically have a pipeline of numerous acquisition opportunities at differing stages of evaluation. We aim primarily to acquire companies that have a competitive market position with the potential to increase market share, a strong brand, high recurring revenue and strong margin potential. In the ordinary course of our business, we seek acquisition targets that can accelerate our growth and generate significant cash flows over time. As more fully described in “Recent Acquisitions”, we consummated five acquisitions in fiscal 2021. 
In light of current market conditions and our efforts to fully integrate the acquisitions made in 2021, we anticipate that our acquisition activities will proceed at a slower pace, particularly during the first half of 2022. Nonetheless, we expect to continue to evaluate opportunities and maintain a pipeline of potential targets. We are not party to any definitive agreements in respect of such acquisition targets as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the timing and our desire to consummate any such acquisition depends, among other things, on the results of our continuing due diligence, which may 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

include, in each case, a quality of earnings report from a third party provider and, in each case, audited financial statements, which we are requiring even though we do not expect the acquisitions to be “significant” and to require us to include such audits in our public filings under the SEC’s Regulation S-X. Even if our due diligence efforts lead us to desire to consummate acquisitions, there is no assurance that we will consummate the acquisition of any of the targets in our pipeline. In addition to the continuing diligence efforts outlined above, we will still need to enter into definitive agreements with the targets in a dynamic market which may impact corresponding valuation metrics and multiples and, even if an agreement is entered into, both parties would need to satisfy any applicable closing conditions. There are a number of other factors that could impact our ability to successfully complete these acquisitions, including competition for targets, sometimes from competitors with greater available resources for acquisitions. 
It should be noted that acquisitions involve a number of risks and may not achieve our expectations; and, therefore, we could be adversely affected by any such acquisition. There are a number of risks inherent in assessing the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent or other liabilities, and potential profitability of acquisition candidates, as well as the challenges of integrating acquired companies and achieving potential synergies once an acquisition is consummated, that may cause an acquisition to fail.

We also gained new domestic manufacturing and distribution capabilities on the east and west coasts along with a peat moss harvesting operation in Canada. 
H&G Acquisition
On June 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of House & Garden, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“HG”), Humboldt Wholesale, Inc., a California corporation (“HW”), Allied Imports & 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Logistics, Inc., a California corporation (“Allied”), South Coast Horticultural Supply, Inc., a California corporation (“SC” and, together with HG, HW and Allied, the “H&G Entities”). The H&G Entities operate a manufacturing facility in Northern California. See Note 3 - Business Combinations under House & Garden Acquisition, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The H&G Entities produce and distribute premium grade plant nutrients and fertilizers across the globe. We believe the strategic combination of our leading distribution capabilities with the H&G Entities’ local and global network and nutrient manufacturing capabilities will enable their brand to grow more rapidly across the combined company’s customer base. Moreover, we believe that the acquisition of the H&G Entities further developed our strategy of acquiring branded manufacturers in key CEA product categories, such as plant nutrients. 
HEAVY 16 Acquisition
On May 3, 2021, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Field 16, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (‘‘HEAVY 16’’). See Note 3 - Business Combinations under Heavy 16 Acquisition, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 HEAVY 16 is a leading manufacturer and supplier of branded plant nutritional products, with nine core products that are currently sold across the United States. The HEAVY 16 products feature a full line of premium nutrients with the nine core products used in all stages of plant growth, helping to increase the yield and quality of crops. HEAVY 16 operates a manufacturing facility in Southern California. 
Effects of COVID-19 on Our Business
The World Health Organization recognized COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 and as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Vaccines for COVID-19 continue to be administered in the United States and other countries around the world, but the extent and rate of vaccine adoption, the long-term efficacy of these vaccines and other factors remain uncertain. Authorities throughout the world have implemented measures to contain or mitigate the spread of the virus, including physical distancing, travel bans and restrictions, closure of non-essential businesses, quarantines, work-from-home directives, mask requirements, shelter-in-place orders and vaccination programs. The global pandemic and actions taken to contain COVID-19 have adversely affected the global economy and financial markets.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented business continuity plans designed to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, such as restrictions on non-essential business travel, the institution of work-from-home practices and the implementation of strategies for workplace safety at our facilities. We have historically and may continue to source select products from China. It is difficult to predict the extent to which COVID-19, including the emergence and spread of more transmissible variants, may continue to spread. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, manufacturers in China and in North America are generally back in operation; however, new waves of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in the re-closure of factories in China and/or in North America. Quarantine orders and travel restrictions within the United States and other countries may also adversely impact our supply chains, the manufacturing of our own products and our ability to obtain necessary materials. We are experiencing some extended lead times in our supply chain, as well as increased shipping costs and believe the COVID-19 pandemic is a contributing factor to those extended lead times and increased costs. Although we have not, to date, experienced any material interruptions in our ability to fill our customers' orders or manufacture our own products, we may in the future be unable to obtain adequate inventory to fill purchase orders or manufacture our own products, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, potential suppliers or sources of materials may pass the increase in sourcing costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic to us through price increases, thereby impacting our potential future profit margins. We continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and will adjust our mitigation strategies as necessary to address changing health, operational or financial risks that may arise.
Our customers reside in countries, primarily the United States and Canada, that are currently affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these customers have experienced shelter-in-place measures in attempts to contain the spread of COVID-19, including general lockdowns, closure of schools and non-essential businesses, bans on gatherings and travel restrictions. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Our business has remained resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2021, our manufacturing and distribution operations are viewed as essential services and continue to operate. Our key suppliers, retailers and resellers have been designated as essential services and remain open at this time; however, in certain places they are operating under reduced hours and capacity limitations. The majority of U.S. and Canadian cannabis businesses have been designated as essential by U.S. state and Canadian government authorities. 
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows depends on future developments that are highly uncertain, rapidly evolving and difficult to predict at this time. Depending on the length and severity of COVID-19, we may experience an increase or decrease in customer orders driven by volatility in consumer shopping and consumption behavior. It is difficult to assess or quantify with precision the impact COVID-19 has directly had on our business since we cannot precisely quantify the impacts, if any, that the various effects (e.g. possible positive demand impact from shelter-in-place orders in the United States, possible negative supply chain impact from workforce disruption at international and domestic suppliers and domestic ports and the possible negative impact on transportation costs) have had on the overall business. And so, while we do not believe that we are experiencing net material adverse impacts at this time, given the global economic slowdown, the overall disruption of global supply chains and distribution systems and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. While we believe that we are well positioned for the future as we navigate the crisis and prepare for an eventual return to a more normal operating environment, we continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic as we evolve our business continuity plans and response strategy.
Government Regulation
 While there is no national governmental regulation relating to the sale of hydroponics equipment, certain products included in our growing media and nutrients product line are subject to certain registration requirements with some U.S. state regulators and federal regulations.
Media and Nutrients
Our leading product lines are growing media and nutrients products. These product lines include organic soils and nutrients that contain ingredients that require the companies that provide us with these products to register the product with certain regulators. The use and disposal of these products in some jurisdictions are subject to regulation by various agencies. A decision by a regulatory agency to significantly restrict the use of impact on those companies providing us with such regulated products, and as a result, limit our ability to sell these products.
 International, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental, health and safety matters affect us in several ways in light of the ingredients that are used in products included in our growing media and nutrients product line. In the United States, products containing pesticides generally must be registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and similar state agencies before they can be sold or applied. The failure by one of our partners to obtain, or the cancellation of any such registration, or the withdrawal from the marketplace of such pesticides, could have an adverse effect on our businesses, the severity of which would depend on the products involved, whether other products could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected. The pesticides we use are either granted a license by the EPA or exempt from such a license and may be evaluated by the EPA as part of its ongoing exposure risk assessment. The EPA may decide that a pesticide we distribute will be limited or will not be re-registered for use in the United States. We cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect on our business of any future evaluations, if any, conducted by the EPA.
 In addition, the use of certain pesticide products are regulated by various international, federal, state, provincial and local environmental and public health agencies. Although we strive to comply with such laws and regulations and have processes in place designed to achieve compliance, we may be unable to prevent violations of these or other laws and regulations from occurring. Even if we are able to comply with all such laws and regulations and obtain all necessary registrations and licenses, the pesticides or other products we apply or use, or the manner in which we apply or use them, could be alleged to cause injury to the environment, to people or to animals, or such products could be banned in certain circumstances.
Cannabis Industry
 We sell our products through third-party retailers and resellers which do not exclusively sell to the cannabis industry. Nonetheless, it is evident to us that the legalization of cannabis in many U.S. states and Canada has ultimately had a significant, positive impact on our industry. Accordingly, laws and regulations governing the cultivation and sale of cannabis and related 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

products have an indirect effect on our business. Legislation and regulations pertaining to the use and growth of cannabis are enacted on both the state and federal government level within the United States. The federal and state laws and regulations governing the growth and use of cannabis may be subject to change. New laws and regulations pertaining to the use or cultivation of cannabis and enforcement actions by state and federal authorities concerning the cultivation or use of cannabis could indirectly reduce demand for our products, and may impact our current and planned future operations.
 Individual state laws regarding the cultivation, possession, and use of cannabis for adult and medical uses conflict with federal laws prohibiting the cultivation, possession and use of cannabis for any purpose. A number of states have passed legislation legalizing or decriminalizing cannabis for adult use, other states have enacted legislation specifically permitting the cultivation and use of cannabis for medicinal purposes, and several states have enacted legislation permitting cannabis cultivation and use for both adult and medicinal purposes.
 Certain of our products may be purchased for use in new and emerging industries and/or be subject to varying, inconsistent, and rapidly changing laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, future scientific research and public perception.
We sell products, including hydroponic gardening products, through third-party retailers and resellers. End users may purchase these products for use in new and emerging industries, including the growing of cannabis that may not grow or achieve market acceptance in a manner that we can predict. The demand for these products is dependent on the growth of these industries, which is uncertain, as well as the laws governing the growth, possession, and use of cannabis by adults for both adult and medical-use.
 Laws and regulations affecting the U.S. cannabis industry are continually changing, which could detrimentally affect our growth, revenues, results of operations and success generally. Local, state and federal cannabis laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require the end users of certain of our products or us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter our respective business plans. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.
 The public’s perception of cannabis may significantly impact the cannabis industry’s success. Both the medical and adult use of cannabis are controversial topics, and there is no guarantee that future scientific research, publicity, regulations, medical opinion, and public opinion relating to cannabis will be favorable. The cannabis industry is an early-stage business that is constantly evolving with no guarantee of viability. The market for medical and adult use of cannabis is uncertain, and any adverse or negative publicity, scientific research, limiting regulations, medical opinion and public opinion (whether or not accurate or with merit) relating to the consumption of cannabis, whether in the U.S. or internationally, may have a material adverse effect on our operational results, consumer base, and financial results. Among other things, such a shift in public opinion could cause state jurisdictions to abandon initiatives or proposals to legalize medical or adult cannabis or adopt new laws or regulations restricting or prohibiting the medical or adult-use of cannabis where it is now legal, thereby limiting the potential customers and end-users of our products who are engaged in the cannabis industry (collectively “Cannabis Industry Participants”).
 Demand for our products may be negatively impacted depending on how laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions develop. We cannot predict the nature of such developments or the effect, if any, that such developments could have on our business.
 We are subject to a number of risks, directly and indirectly through our Cannabis Industry Participants, because cannabis is illegal under federal law. Federal law and enforcement may adversely affect the implementation of medical cannabis and/or adult-use cannabis laws, and may negatively impact our revenues and profits.
Under the United States Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (the “CSA”), the U.S. government lists cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance (i.e., deemed to have no medical value), and accordingly the manufacturing (cultivation), sale, or possession of cannabis is federally illegal. It is also federally illegal to advertise the sale of cannabis or to sell paraphernalia designed or intended primarily for use with cannabis, unless the paraphernalia is authorized by federal, state, or local law. The United States Supreme Court has ruled in United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Cooperative and Gonzales v. Raich, 532 U.S. 483 (2001), that the federal government has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes. The illegality of cannabis under federal law preempts state laws that legalize its use. Therefore, strict enforcement of federal law regarding cannabis would likely adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

 Other laws that directly impact the cannabis growers that are end users of certain of our products include:
•Businesses trafficking in cannabis may not take tax deductions for costs beyond costs of goods sold under Code Section 280E. There is no way to predict how the federal government may treat cannabis businesses from a taxation standpoint in the future and no assurance can be given to what extent Code Section 280E, or other tax-related laws and regulations, may be applied to cannabis businesses in the future.
•Because the manufacturing (cultivation), sale, possession and use of cannabis is illegal under federal law, cannabis businesses may have restricted intellectual property and proprietary rights, particularly with respect to obtaining and enforcing patents and trademarks. Our inability to register, or maintain, our trademarks or file for or enforce patents on any of our inventions could materially affect our ability to protect our name, brand and proprietary technologies. In addition, cannabis businesses may face court action by third parties under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”). Our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be impaired as a result of our retailers’ and resellers’ involvement with cannabis business, and we could be named as a defendant in an action asserting a RICO violation.
•Similar to the risks relating to intellectual property and proprietary rights, there is an argument that the federal bankruptcy courts cannot provide relief for parties who engage in cannabis. Recent bankruptcy rulings have denied bankruptcies for cannabis dispensaries upon the justification that businesses cannot violate federal law and then claim the benefits of federal bankruptcy for the same activity and upon the justification that courts cannot ask a bankruptcy trustee to take possession of, and distribute cannabis assets as such action would violate the CSA. Therefore, due to our retailers’ and resellers’ involvement with cannabis businesses, we may not be able to seek the protection of the bankruptcy courts and this could materially affect our financial performance and/or our ability to obtain or maintain credit.
•Since cannabis is illegal under federal law, there is a strong argument that banks cannot accept for deposit funds from businesses involved in the cannabis industry. Consequently, businesses involved in the cannabis industry often have difficulty finding a bank willing to accept their business. Any such inability to open or maintain bank accounts may make it difficult for us to operate our business. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), banks must report to the federal government any suspected illegal activity, which includes any transaction associated with a cannabis business. These reports must be filed even though the business is operating legitimately under state law. In addition, due to our retailers’ and resellers’ involvement with cannabis businesses, our existing bank accounts could be closed.
•Insurance that is otherwise readily available, such as general liability and directors and officer’s insurance, may be more difficult for us to find, and more expensive, to the extent we are deemed to operate in the cannabis industry. 
The former administration, or any new administration or attorney general, could change federal enforcement policy or execution and decide to enforce the federal cannabis laws more strongly. On January 4, 2018, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum rescinding previous guidance (directing U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorneys’ offices to focus their cannabis enforcement efforts under federal law only in identified priority areas, such as sale to minors, criminal enterprises, and interstate sales). Under the Sessions memorandum, local U.S. Attorneys’ offices retain discretion regarding the prosecution of cannabis activity authorized under state laws and regulations. While former U.S. Attorney General William Barr expressed support for the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws (NORML) during his Senate testimony on April 10, 2019, further change in the federal approach towards enforcement could negatively affect the industry, potentially ending it entirely. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. The legal uncertainty and possible future changes in law could negatively affect our growth, revenues, results of operations and success generally.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Federal authorities may decide to change their current posture and begin to enforce current federal cannabis law and, if they decide to ignore the principles in the Cole Memorandum (as defined below) and begin to aggressively enforce such laws, it is possible that they could allege that we violated federal laws by selling products used in the cannabis industry. As a result, active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus directly or indirectly adversely affect our revenues and profits.
 Violations of any U.S. federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the U.S. federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities or divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our reputation and ability to conduct business, the listing of our securities on any stock exchanges, the settlement of trades of our securities, our ability to obtain banking services, our financial position, operating results, profitability or liquidity or the market price of our publicly traded shares. In addition, it is difficult for us to estimate the time or resources that would be needed for the investigation of any such matters or their final resolution because, in part, the time and resources that may be needed are dependent on the nature and extent of any information requested by the applicable authorities involved, and such time or resources could be substantial.
Businesses involved in the cannabis industry, and investments in such businesses, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations related to money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crimes.
We sell our products through third-party retailers and resellers which do not exclusively sell to the cannabis industry. Investments in the U.S. cannabis industry are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that involve money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crime, including the BSA, as amended by the USA Patriot Act, other anti-money laundering laws, and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States. In February 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) of the Treasury Department issued a memorandum (the “FinCEN Memo”) providing guidance to banks seeking to provide services to cannabis businesses. The FinCEN Memo outlines circumstances under which banks may provide services to cannabis businesses without risking federal prosecution for violation of U.S. federal money laundering laws. It refers to supplementary guidance that Deputy Attorney General Cole issued to U.S. federal prosecutors relating to the prosecution of U.S. money laundering offenses predicated on cannabis violations of the CSA and outlines extensive due diligence and reporting requirements. The FinCEN Memo currently remains in place, but it is unclear at this time whether the current administration will continue to follow the guidelines of the FinCEN Memo. Such requirements could negatively affect the ability of certain of the end users of our products to establish and maintain banking relationships.
 Cannabis Industry Participants are subject to federal and state controlled substance laws and regulations. As a result, we are indirectly subject to a number of risks related to controlled substances.
We sell our products through third-party retailers and resellers which do not exclusively sell to the cannabis industry. Some of our products are sold to Cannabis Industry Participants and used in connection with cannabis businesses that are subject to federal and state controlled substance laws and regulations. Cannabis businesses are subject to a number of risks related to controlled substances, which risks could reduce demand for our products by Cannabis Industry Participants. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
•Cannabis is a Schedule I drug under the CSA and regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) as an illegal substance. The Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), in conjunction with the DEA, licenses cannabis research and drugs containing active ingredients derived from cannabis. If cannabis were to become legal under federal law, its sale and use could become regulated by the FDA or another federal agency.
•If cannabis were to become regulated by the FDA or another federal agency, extensive regulations may be imposed on the sale or use of cannabis. Such regulations could result in a decrease in cannabis sales and have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products. If we or our Cannabis Industry Participants are unable to comply with any applicable regulations and/or registration prescribed by the FDA, we may be unable to continue to conduct business with retailers and resellers that transact with cannabis businesses and/or our financial condition may be adversely impacted.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

•Controlled substance legislation differs between states and legislation in certain states may restrict or limit our ability to sell products to Cannabis Industry Participants. Our Cannabis Industry Participants may be required to obtain separate state registrations, permits or licenses in order to be able to obtain, handle and/or distribute controlled substances in a state. Such state regulatory requirements may be costly and, the failure of such Cannabis Industry Participants to meet such regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions by the states in addition to any from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law. We could be implicated in such enforcement or sanctions because of the sale of our products to such Cannabis Industry Participants.
•The failure of our Cannabis Industry Participants to comply with applicable controlled substance laws and regulations, or the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations, may adversely affect the demand for our products and, as a result, the financial results of our business operations and our financial condition.
 Furthermore, the Loan and Security Agreement by and among certain of our subsidiaries (the “Subsidiary Obligors”) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., dated March 29, 2021 (the “JPMorgan Credit Facility”) restricts our ability to sell our products directly to cannabis growers or to retailers that sell only to the cannabis industry in countries where it is federally illegal. As a result, the Subsidiary Obligors do not sell our products directly to the cannabis industry, cannabis growers or cultivators, or to sellers or retailers that sell only to the cannabis industry. See “— Risks Relating to our Indebtedness” for further detail. 
Intellectual Property
 We own 15 issued U.S. design patents, 2 issued U.S. utility patents, 3 issued foreign patents and designs, 112 registered U.S. trademarks, and 22 registered foreign trademarks that enable us to position ourselves and our products to a wide range of customers. Our 20 issued patents cover grow lighting and hydroponic systems and components. These issued patents and our registered trademarks allow us to build out our proprietary brand products, which we believe are high quality products and generate higher sales margins than the distributed products that we sell. Our owned U.S. and foreign issued patents are expected to expire between 2022 and 2035.
Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our rights to trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights we own or license. We have not sought to register every one of our trademarks either in the U.S. or in every country in which such mark is used. Furthermore, because of the differences in foreign trademark, patent and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws, we may not receive the same protection in other countries as we would in the U.S. with respect to the registered brand names and issued patents we hold. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products or services infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property or proprietary rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.
 We may need to obtain licenses to patents and other intellectual property and proprietary rights held by third parties to develop, manufacture and market our products, if, for example, we sought to develop our products, in conjunction with any patented technology. If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms (or at all) and maintain these licenses, our ability to commercially market our products, may be inhibited or prevented.
 In addition, because the manufacturing (cultivation), sale, possession and use of cannabis is illegal under federal law, companies that transact with cannabis businesses may have restricted intellectual property and proprietary rights particularly with respect to obtaining and enforcing patents and trademarks. We do not believe these restrictions apply to our business. However, if we are unable to register, or maintain, our trademarks or file for or enforce patents on any of our inventions, such an inability could materially affect our ability to protect our name, brand and proprietary technologies. See “— Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property” for more information on the risks associated with intellectual and proprietary rights.
Research and Development
 We continually invest in research and development to improve our products, manufacturing processes, packaging and delivery systems. In addition to the benefits of our own research and development, we actively seek ways to leverage the research and development activities of our suppliers and other business partners.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Human Capital
 Our continued success depends on management implementing effective human resource initiatives in order to recruit, develop and retain key employees. As of December 31, 2021, we employ 709 full-time employees and 11 part-time employees. We also employ 106 temporary workers and 9 independent contractors. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. Our retention rate for our full-time employees is approximately five years, and we employ various initiatives to increase employee retention, including offering bonus programs and training opportunities. We strive to foster an innovative and team-oriented culture and view our human capital resources and initiatives as an ongoing priority.
