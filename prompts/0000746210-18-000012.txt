Item 1. Business
Overview
-1-

Glowpoint, Inc. (“Glowpoint” or “we” or “us” or the “Company”) is a managed service provider of video collaboration and network applications. Our services are designed to provide a comprehensive suite of automated and concierge applications to simplify the user experience and expedite the adoption of video as the primary means of collaboration. Our customers include Fortune 1000 companies, along with small and medium enterprises in a variety of industries. We market our services globally through a multi-channel sales approach that includes direct sales and channel partners. The Company was formed as a Delaware corporation in May 2000. The Company operates in one segment and therefore segment information is not presented.

We experienced significant declines in revenue during 2017, 2016 and 2015. These revenue declines are primarily due to net attrition of customers and lower demand for our services given the competitive environment and pressure on pricing that exists in our industry. During the past several years, we had limited resources to invest in product development and sales and marketing in order to reverse the Company’s revenue trends. We reduced our sales and marketing expenses from $2,047,000 in 2015 to $664,000 in 2016 and then to $413,000 in 2017 in an effort to improve Adjusted EBITDA, generate positive cash flow from operations and maintain compliance with financial covenants under our loan agreements.
During the period from July 31, 2017 through January 26, 2018, the Company completed a series of transactions (each of which is described further in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources”) that improved our financial position and liquidity. We reduced our outstanding debt obligations from $11.5 million as of June 30, 2017 to $0.6 million as of January 31, 2018, while increasing our cash position from $1.1 million as of June 30, 2017 to $3.6 million as of January 31, 2018. The following is a summary of these transactions (and, where noted below, includes events subsequent to our fiscal year ending December 31, 2017): 
•On July 31, 2017, the Company completed a recapitalization of its debt obligations which reduced debt and accrued interest obligations by $9,362,000.
•On October 24, 2017, the Company closed a registered direct offering of 2,800 shares of our 0% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) for net proceeds of $2,280,000 (the “Series B Offering”).
•On January 2, 2018, the Company made a $200,000 principal payment on the Western Alliance Bank Loan Agreement (the “Western Alliance Bank Loan Payment”).
•On January 25, 2018, the Company closed a registered direct offering of 1,750 shares of our 0% Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”) for net proceeds of $1,531,000 (the “Series C Offering”).
•On January 26, 2018, the Company terminated the Business Loan and Security Agreement, dated July 31, 2017, by and between the Company and Super G Capital LLC (“Super G”), along with the accompanying Warrant to Purchase Shares of Common Stock, dated July 31, 2017, and paid off all remaining debt obligations with Super G (“the Super G Payoff”).
With a strengthened balance sheet, the Company currently expects to fund investments in product development, sales and marketing expenses and capital expenditures in order to develop new service offerings, with the goal of reversing the Company’s negative revenue trends. The Company intends to release new services in the summer of 2018 that leverage our core strengths in information technology (“IT”) service management and are focused on automation and microlearning (or short bursts of focused information necessary to help a learner achieve a specific actionable objective).
Our Services
Video Collaboration Services
We provide a wide range of video collaboration services, from automated to orchestrated, to address the spectrum of user experience and business applications, in an effort to drive adoption of video throughout the enterprise. We deliver our services through a hybrid service platform or as a service layer on top of our customers’ video infrastructure. We provide our customers with the following suite of services to meet their videoconferencing needs:
Managed Videoconferencing is a “high-touch” concierge-based offering where Glowpoint sets up and manages customer videoconferences. We offer managed videoconferencing both as a cloud-based service, with videoconferences hosted in the Glowpoint Cloud, as described under “---Intellectual Property” below, and as an on-premise solution leveraging the customer’s existing video infrastructure. Managed videoconferencing is available globally and works effectively across multiple networks and video devices, including desktop and mobile devices. Despite a trend to move toward “self-service” videoconferencing, many of our customers remain reliant on our scheduling, event support and conference management services. Our managed videoconferencing services are offered to our customers on either a usage basis or on a monthly subscription. These services include: 
-2-

Scheduling: Customers can schedule their videoconference using Microsoft Outlook®, Cisco TelePresence Management Suite®, or through Glowpoint’s CustomerPoint® web portal. 
Call Launching: Once the videoconference is scheduled, it automatically launches at the designated time. Glowpoint will “bridge” the videoconference by calling the selected video endpoints at the time of the scheduled call and making sure they are properly connected. We believe that automated launching creates cost efficiencies for both customers and Glowpoint and provides a desired evolution path that aligns with the market trend toward increasing self-service models. 
Conference Monitoring & Support: Glowpoint’s systems will monitor the video meeting to make sure everything remains properly connected and operable during a conference. If an incident occurs during a meeting, one of our conference producers can reconnect and/or fix issues per standard practices or as requested by the customer. 
Conference Reports: Customer administrators can generate reports through our portal to show videoconference details, statistics and success rates. 
JoinMyVideo™ is an on-demand video meeting room (“VMR”) service that allows users to join from web browsers, desktops, mobile apps, and commonly used videoconferencing systems. We introduced JoinMyVideo™ in 2015 to meet customers’ needs to use video communications in a mobile environment, as further discussed under “---Market Need” below. With JoinMyVideo™, users are able to manage the participants in the video meeting, allowing up to 24 participants to join the meeting. JoinMyVideo™ is a cloud-based software-as-a-service solution, so the customer has no infrastructure to buy and maintain. JoinMyVideo™ is offered to our customers on a monthly subscription basis. 
Hybrid Videoconferencing helps enterprises migrate from managed videoconferencing to VMRs by bringing together attributes of both services. Users can schedule their VMR, add endpoints, and send invitations to participants through an online portal. At the scheduled time, the VMR is launched, connecting the scheduled endpoints and allowing self-service users to join from video systems and desktop and mobile video apps. We introduced our Hybrid Videoconferencing service in 2015 as we believe that merging these connection capabilities accommodates all types of users and meetings.
Video Meeting Suites provide remote access to videoconferencing for everyday business meetings and events, allowing our customers to conduct meetings and events in over 4,000 physical meeting suites across 1,300 cities without investing in video devices or infrastructure. We have partnered with the owners of these videoconference centers and arrange for our customers to hold videoconferences at convenient locations across the world based on customers’ needs. Our primary service includes the scheduling and management of a highly orchestrated business-class meeting for a professional meeting experience. As part of the extended offering beyond the physical office suite, we also enable participants who elect to use a mobile device to join a video conference from anywhere in the world. These services are largely usage-based. We also offer our customers monthly subscription rates based on a fixed number of concurrent users. 
Webcasting events enable our customers to stream live video feeds to up to thousands of viewers through their browsers and mobile devices. Enterprises often use this service on a quarterly basis for earnings calls and town hall events. 
Remote Service Management
Our Remote Service Management provides an overlay to enterprise information technology (“IT”) and channel partner support organizations and provides 24/7 support and management of customer video environments. Our services are designed to align with a globally recognized set of best practices, Information Technology Infrastructure Library (“ITIL”), to standardize processes and communicate through a consistent set of terms with our customers and partners. We leverage a best-in-class IT service management (“ITSM”) provider, ServiceNow Inc., to systematically provide Remote Service Management, as well as enable Glowpoint to integrate with an enterprise’s systems and workflows. 
We offer, on a monthly subscription basis, three tiers of Remote Service Management options, ranging from automated monitoring to end-to-end management to complement the needs of IT support organizations, as described below: 
Resolve - Total Support is our most comprehensive management and support service and targets enterprises that want to completely offload day-to-day operations of their video environment to Glowpoint. We provide:
24x7 Support Desk: Around-the-clock access to our expert staff via phone and email for support inquiries. 
Incident Management: Systematic management of incidents from service request to closure. All incidents are tracked and visible from our online ITSM portal. 
-3-

Problem Management: Root cause analysis and coordination to prevent and quickly repair incidents. 
Change Management: Management of maintenance contracts for infrastructure and endpoints to ensure systems are up to date, operating at peak performance, and have coverage from the manufacturer. 
Site Certifications: Baseline testing of endpoints to make sure they are configured for optimal performance. 
Service Level Agreements (“SLA”): Performance guarantees with our SLA backed services. 
Helpdesk provides level 1 support and allows enterprise IT to scale and expand the reach of support to end users. We complement the existing staff by taking the initial service request from the end users and providing incident management. We provide: 
24x7 Support Desk: Around-the-clock access to our expert staff via phone and email for support inquiries. 
Incident Management: Systematic management of minor incidents, general service inquiries, and an initial assessment for major and critical incidents. We escalate major incidents to the appropriate and responsible parties. 
Proactive Monitoring is a remote and automated monitoring service that detects events and alerts customers’ IT when a service impacting event is discovered. The service is provided in conjunction with either Resolve - Total Support or Helpdesk. We provide: 
Event Management: 24/7 monitoring of our customers’ infrastructure and endpoints with email alerts when events are detected. 
Automated Video Room Sweeps (“AVRS”): Our custom developed service accesses our customers’ endpoints every night, measures audio & video quality, and verifies firmware. 
Network Services
Glowpoint’s network services provide our customers around the world with network solutions that ensure reliable, high-quality and secure traffic of video, data and internet. Network services are offered to our customers on a monthly subscription basis. Our network services business carries variable costs associated with the purchasing and reselling of this connectivity. We offer our customers the following networking solutions that can be tailored to each customer’s needs: 

• | Cloud Connect: Video™: Allows our customers to outsource the management of their video traffic to us and provides the customer’s office locations with a secure, dedicated video network connection to the Glowpoint Cloud for video communications.


• | Cloud Connect: Converge™: Provides customized Multiprotocol Label Switching (“MPLS”) solutions for customers who require a converged network. A converged network is an efficient network solution that combines the customer’s voice, video, data, and Internet traffic over one or more common access circuits. Glowpoint fully manages and prioritizes traffic to ensure that video and other business critical applications run smoothly. 


• | Cloud Connect: Cross Connect™: Allows the customer to leverage their existing carrier for the extension of a Layer 2 private line to Glowpoint’s data center.

Professional and Other Services
Our professional services include onsite support, or dispatch, as well as configuration or customization of equipment or software on behalf of a customer. On a limited basis, we also resell video equipment to our customers. 
Sales and Marketing
We currently sell our services through direct sales and indirect sales channels. During the past several years, we had limited resources to invest in sales and marketing. As of December 31, 2017, we had 2 employees engaged in sales and marketing. We reduced our sales and marketing expenses from $2,047,000 in 2015, to $664,000 in 2016, and to $413,000 in 2017 in order to improve Adjusted EBITDA and maintain positive cash flow from operations. The Company plans to increase sales and marketing expenses in 2018 in connection with our planned new service offerings. Our sales/account management team is responsible for developing relationships and expanding opportunities within our existing customer base as well as targeting our services to other 
-4-

large and medium-sized companies.  We partner with agents and wholesale channels to expand the size and reach of these efforts.  The customers we target have a proven need for business communication services in diverse vertical markets, such as professional services, business services, computer software, manufacturing and financial services. The efforts of our channel sales group focuses on partnering with complementary system integrators and service providers, to leverage their customer bases and distribution channels. We private label or co-brand our services for these partners depending on their requirements. We primarily focus our marketing efforts on direct marketing programs aimed at our target buyer personas (e.g., IT decision makers) within our target verticals. We seek to generate qualified leads for our sales team, educate and retain existing customers, generate brand awareness through public relations including social media and drive service enhancements using research and customer feedback. We believe that sales cycles associated with selling our services directly to enterprise IT organizations and through our channel partners typically range from six to eighteen months.

Market Need
As enterprise and mid-market businesses, such as many of our customers, increasingly seek to improve customer experience through the quality of communication services, they are confronted with several industry trends presenting emerging and varied challenges. We believe the most forceful among these trends are:

• | increasing mobility of the workforce;


• | shifting priorities of business decision makers, including an increased preference for cloud delivery of applications, software-defined networking, and management of multiple and varied devices; and


• | the rise of multi-channel customer service involving multiple modes of communications.

Our objective is to re-shape and simplify the manner by which enterprises and mid-market companies use video and related collaboration tools. We have invested in leading collaboration and ITSM platforms and are well poised to serve a broad range of needs, from servicing conventional video systems to providing real-time support tools via the cloud. While we remain committed to our legacy capabilities and the customers who rely on them, we have focused our primary resources on the emerging landscape by evolving our view of the market and product approach in three important ways:

1. | We have invested in research and development and new technologies to develop and provide a more comprehensive suite of support systems and real-time analytics;


2. | We continue to evolve our product design philosophy, anticipating demand for products that are cloud and mobile enabled but also flexible, extensible, secure and reliable. The goal is to allow our customers to transition from old communications and collaboration technology to more comprehensive (unified) applications in a way that is manageable and highly cost-effective.


3. | We have increased our focus on re-packaging our products and services into simple, easy to purchase “bundles.” These bundles address the challenges faced by our customers and offer the advantage of being customizable where necessary to meet customer needs.

As we continue to transform Glowpoint into a service-led organization, revenue attributable to our core and legacy product lines and services has declined. We have worked to migrate customers from legacy products, such as managed videoconferencing and video meeting suites, to more automated/software-based solutions. As a result of a growing market trend around cloud consumption preferences, more customers are exploring cost-effective software-based services for procuring technology. As this trend continues, the Company has remained focused on generating positive cash flow from operations and investing in future results by implementing cost savings programs designed to streamline its operations and eliminate overlapping processes and expenses. These cost savings programs have included: (i) reducing headcount, (ii) closing office space, (iii) eliminating other real estate costs and infrastructure associated with unused or under-utilized facilities, (iv) relocating certain job functions to lower cost geographies, including service delivery, customer care, research and development, human resources and finance, and (v) implementing reductions in cost of revenue associated with external service providers. 
Many enterprises have become dependent on video communications for increased productivity and reduced operating costs, thus making video communications part of their core business practices. With the technology advancements over the past few years, including browser-based and mobile video, the options for video collaboration solutions and services are greater than ever before. The growing combinations of hardware, software, and networks challenge enterprise IT organizations with finding the right fit for their business objectives. Enterprises must consider and account for implementation and integration, user adoption, analytics, management and support, and maintaining a return on investment with the existing technology deployment while 
-5-

preventing technology obsolescence. As a result, businesses are increasingly seeking an outsourced partner for managed services and hosted, cloud-based infrastructure to mitigate risk, reduce operational costs, and increase user satisfaction by delivering a higher caliber support level to their business.
We believe that many companies cannot fully support quality video communications on their existing infrastructure and networks. Enterprises have reduced or curtailed investments in immersive telepresence (“ITP”) videoconferencing systems, now preferring cloud-based solutions and personal or smaller group video systems. Enabling video on desktops and increased mobility remains a primary enterprise objective. As demand for ITP systems and related services decreases, and the demand for mobility and personal video services increases, we will continue to evolve our solutions to align with and attempt to satisfy this market demand. 
Glowpoint provides enterprises with the ability to simplify the video experience, which increases adoption and user participation. Glowpoint’s unique and wide range of video collaboration services is intended to provide a service for every user and meeting type within the enterprise. We believe our ITSM platform delivers the right tools, automation, and analytics to partners to enable a successful video deployment. 
Competition
With respect to our video collaboration services, we primarily compete with managed services companies, videoconferencing equipment resellers and telecommunication providers, including BT Conferencing, AT&T, Verizon, LogMeIn, Yorktel, ConvergeOne, Whitlock and AVI-SPL. We also compete with certain start-up and venture capital-backed companies that offer hosted videoconference bridging solutions, including Blue Jeans Networks, Vidyo and Zoom. Lastly, the technology and software providers, including Cisco, LifeSize, Microsoft (Skype for Business) and Polycom, are delivering competitive cloud-based videoconferencing and calling services. With respect to our network services, we primarily compete with telecommunications carriers, including British Telecom, AT&T, Verizon and Telus. Our competitors offer services similar to ours both on a bundled and un-bundled basis, creating a highly competitive environment with pressure on pricing of such services. Competitor solutions also create opportunities for integration and support services for Glowpoint.

We believe we differentiate ourselves based on our full suite of cloud and managed video collaboration services in combination with the ITSM platform for support automation. We believe our services are unique based on our intellectual property, user interfaces and capabilities that we have built over the years. 
Customers
Our customers include Fortune 1000 companies, along with small and medium enterprises across a wide range of industries including consulting, executive search, broadcast media, legal, finance, insurance and technology. Major customers are defined as direct customers or channel partners that account for more than 10% of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, two major customers accounted for 23% and 16%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, two major customers accounted for 16% and 12%, respectively, of our total revenue. Any reduction in the use of our services or the business failure by one of our major customers and/or wholesale channel partners could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Intellectual Property
Glowpoint has invested in research and development, engineering and application development in the process of building our managed service and cloud platforms. Some of this development has led to issued patents, as described below, along with ongoing recognition in the industry as having unique tools and applications to enable our video applications.
Glowpoint Cloud Conferencing 
The Glowpoint Cloud is based on a Service Oriented Architecture framework that enables us to create unique unified communication service offerings. Glowpoint’s cloud-based-video services can be delivered as a software and infrastructure service in a hosted environment or can support a hybrid mix of public and private clouds.
Videoconferencing has traditionally presented challenges for the user by presenting a complex maze of systems and networks that must be navigated and closely managed. Although most of the business-quality video systems today are “standards-based,” there are inherent interoperability problems between different vendors’ video equipment, resulting in communication islands. Glowpoint’s suite of cloud and managed video services can be accessed and utilized by customers regardless of their technology or network. Customers who purchase a Cisco, Polycom, Avaya, or LifeSize (Logitech) system, or use certain other third-party 
-6-

video communications software such as Microsoft (Skype for Business), WebEx or WebRTC, may all take advantage of the Glowpoint Cloud regardless of their choice of network. We have built the Glowpoint Cloud to support all standard video signaling protocols, including SIP, H.323 and Integrated Services Digital Network (“ISDN”) using infrastructure from a variety of manufacturers.
The Glowpoint Cloud combines years of best practices, experience and technology development into a video collaboration platform that provides instant connectivity, self-serve and managed help desk resources, and the ease of use that makes video collaboration seamless and effortless. Beyond the technology and applications, the Glowpoint Cloud is built around security protocols to enable enterprises and organizations of any size to communicate with other desired video users in a secure, high-quality and reliable fashion.

Video Service Platform
In 2015, Glowpoint launched our next generation Video Service Platform to provide enterprise customers with a cloud-based system for managing video collaboration.  The Video Service Platform, which leverages technology from an industry leading ITSM provider, ServiceNow Inc., is available to Glowpoint’s channel partners and enterprise customers. The Video Service Platform’s scalability and multi-tenant design allows Glowpoint and its channel partners to seamlessly activate existing and new enterprise customers of Glowpoint.  It is completely web-based and accessible from any web-enabled device. The Video Service Platform automates and streamlines critical functions and workflows needed by IT organizations for managing enterprise video collaboration environments, including incident management, change management, and reporting/analytics for continuous improvement.  Other benefits provided to enterprise IT organizations include:

• | Better transparency into the performance of the enterprise collaboration environment via business intelligence metrics, reporting and management dashboards;


• | Greater scale with self-service support, giving end users an easy interface for submitting/tracking tickets;


• | Deeper expertise for managing video collaboration with access to Glowpoint’s Remote Service Management services and knowledge base;


• | More efficiencies gained by automating manual tasks and workflows including escalations, updates/notifications, and provisioning; and


• | Access to ITIL.

Patents
The development of our “video as a service” applications and network architecture has resulted in a significant amount of proprietary information and technology, including real-time metering and billing for video calls and intelligent call routing. We believe that our patented proprietary technology provides an important barrier for competitors’ potential offerings of similar video communications services. We have been awarded six patents:

• | U.S. Patent No. 7,200,213 was awarded in April 2007 for our live video operator assistance feature. Our “Live Operator” technology provides customers with the ability to obtain live, face-to-face assistance and has widespread application, from general video call assistance to “video concierge” services. This patent is an essential component of providing “expert on demand” and telepresence “white glove” business class support services. This patent expires November 17, 2024. 


• | U.S. Patent No. 7,664,098 was awarded in February 2010 for our real-time metering and billing for Internet Protocol (“IP”) based calls.
