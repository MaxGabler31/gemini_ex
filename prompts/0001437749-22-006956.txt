--------+---------

OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY
 
inTEST Corporation was incorporated in New Jersey in 1981 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1997. The consolidated entity is comprised of inTEST Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. In this report, "we," "us," "our," and the "Company" refer to inTEST Corporation and our consolidated subsidiaries.
 
We are a global supplier of innovative test and process solutions for use in manufacturing and testing serving target markets which include automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial, life sciences, and security (collectively “Multimarket”) as well as both the front-end and back-end of the semiconductor manufacturing industry (“Semi Market”). For the period covered by this report, we managed our business as two operating segments, Thermal Products ("Thermal”) and Electromechanical Semiconductor Products ("EMS"). These businesses design and manufacture thermal test solutions, thermal process products and semiconductor test products.
 
In early 2021, we launched our 5-Point Strategy, our new corporate vision and our mission statement. Our vision is to be the supplier of choice for innovative test and process technology solutions. Our mission is to leverage our deep industry knowledge and expertise to develop and deliver high quality, innovative customer solutions and superior support for complex global challenges. We are committed to becoming recognized as a leader in our markets for design and manufacturing capabilities that help solve our customers’ most complex challenges in their manufacturing and quality processes. Our products provide highly engineered, high quality and cost-effective test and process solutions which are delivered with a customer focus that are intended to drive a high level of customer satisfaction. Our strategy is to consistently develop unique and differentiated solutions through innovative new product development and acquisitions.  We expect to expand our portfolio of products, services, and support to drive increased value to our customers to drive revenue and earnings growth. We believe by executing on our 5-Point Strategy, as described more fully below, that we can grow our annual revenue to between $200 million to $250 million by 2025, while maintaining our strong margin profile. We expect to do this through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Our 5-Point Strategy is as follows:
 

Global and Market Expansion. We believe we can provide significant and sustainable long-term growth by expanding our serviceable addressable market (“SAM”) and building a larger installed product base. To capture this opportunity, we intend to make investments to drive further penetration in our existing markets. These investments may include initiatives to increase revenue both by leveraging our customer relationships to provide a broader array of our current portfolio of products to our existing customer base as well as by expanding our customer base within these markets. In addition, we intend to increase our global footprint and coverage to better serve new and existing customers. Finally, our strategy in this area includes targeting expansion into new markets with our existing product portfolio. In 2021, we have increased our SAM for our legacy product portfolio by over $70 million. We have gained new customers in both the Semi Market and in our other target markets and we have expanded our sales and support network to regions of the world where we identified gaps in coverage, including Mexico, Korea and Italy. Through our acquisitions, we expanded our European footprint with additional locations in the Netherlands and Germany. Innovation and Differentiation. We plan to continue leveraging our engineering know-how and expertise to deliver innovative solutions which we believe often outperform those of our competitors. In 2021, we increased our investment in engineering resources with the goal of developing new and unique solutions to help solve our customers’ most complex challenges in their manufacturing and quality processes. Designed to be broadly applicable through more standardized platforms, these solution platforms enable late-stage configuration to address each customers’ unique requirements. We believe creating more standardization to increase market availability will drive growth and reduce costs by enabling us to increase the breadth and depth of our customer base. In 2021, we completed initiatives that reduced the size and weight for our induction heating products, standardized our chiller offerings for the cannabis industry and progressed our automated manipulator and intelligent docking system offerings.

Service and Support. We have strong customer relationships and believe service and support activities are valuable in strengthening customer satisfaction, loyalty and retention. Through ensuring that we serve our customers’ needs, whether by expanding service coverage and decreasing response time or through expanding and enhancing service offerings, we believe we can drive revenue growth and strengthen our customer relationships. We expect to invest in resources to fill areas where we have identified gaps in service and support. We also plan to invest in technology to provide remote service capabilities to monitor the health of our products that are onsite at customer locations. As we expand our SAM and increase our market penetration, we also expect to identify opportunities to add more consumable products within our offerings. We believe that increasing the number of ways and the frequency with which we make customer contacts can drive growth in our business in the future. In 2021, we added field service technicians in the U.S., a service partner in China and expanded our coil fabrication capabilities in order to reduce our response time to customers when issues arise with their coils. We have new rental program and service agreement offerings as well as remote monitoring services. With our acquisitions, we added test programming and design services, equipment upgrade programs and a recurring service revenue stream for probes.
Strategic Acquisitions & Partnerships. In addition to driving organic growth, our strategy includes acquiring businesses, technologies or products that are complementary to our current product offerings. Our acquisition strategy is to add to our current solutions by expanding capabilities, such as radio frequency or temperature range, and to expand geographic presence. We also will consider new technologies that replicate the highly engineered, high quality and differentiated solutions of our current product portfolio for test and process solutions. Our focus is on expanding our electronic test capabilities, widening our thermal test capabilities in areas such as environmental test, and building out around processing technologies. In 2021, we made three acquisitions that added to our process and test solutions offerings.
Talent and Culture. We believe ensuring the right people are in the right roles and are empowered to deliver success is crucial to the achievement of our core strategies. In addition, we have and will continue to create a culture and environment of openness, one that is results-oriented and drives accountability across the organization. Finally, we intend to foster diversity, equity and inclusion and provide opportunities for career development so as to maximize employee engagement, all of which is necessary to achieving our corporate vision. In 2021, we implemented a new performance management system and talent reviews, completed an employee engagement survey and put an Employee Stock Purchase Plan in place. Approximately two-thirds of our new hires in 2021 were women or underrepresented minorities.
ACQUISITIONS
 
A key element to our strategy for growth is through acquisitions. During 2021, we completed three acquisitions that expanded our technology offerings, diversified our markets and customers and expanded our presence into Europe. 
 
On October 6, 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Z-Sciences Corp. (“Z-Sciences”) (now North Sciences), a developer of ultra-cold storage solutions for the life sciences cold chain market. This small, tuck-in transaction enhances our technology, adds new talent, and provides a low-cost entry into this fast growing, fragmented market. This business is being integrated into our Thermal segment.
 
On October 28, 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Videology Imaging Solutions Inc. and Videology Imaging Solutions (collectively, “Videology”), a global designer, developer and manufacturer of original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) digital streaming and image capturing solutions, for approximately $12.1 million. The acquisition expanded our process technology offerings, diversified our reach into key target markets and broadened our customer base. This business also is being integrated into our Thermal segment.
 
On December 21, 2021, we acquired Acculogic Inc. and its affiliates (“Acculogic”), a global manufacturer of robotics-based electronic production test equipment and application support services, for approximately $9.3 million. The acquisition expanded our global reach and enhanced our product portfolio with leading technologies and automation services. This business is being integrated into our EMS segment.
 
MARKETS
Overview
 
We are focused on specific target markets which include automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial, life sciences, and security as well as both the front-end and back-end of the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Our largest market is the semiconductor industry which represents the roots of inTEST’s engineered product history. We refer to our markets as “Semi Market” and “Multimarket” and expect in the future to further break out our sales and orders by the key target markets on which we are focused.

($ in 000s) | Years Ended |

During 2021, our revenue from the Semi Market grew $28.1 million or 105% as we refocused our efforts to serve our customers well, gain market share and expand our product offerings. Revenue to Multimarket grew $3.0 million, or 11%, in 2021 as we executed on our 5-Point Strategy to increase market penetration, expanded our aggregate SAM and acquired new technology solutions.
 
Multimarket
 
We provide several solutions to our automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial, life sciences, and security markets. We believe a number of drivers are creating more opportunity for our highly-engineered solutions in these markets.
 
In the automotive market, we provide solutions that help in the quality and productivity of electric vehicle (“EV”) manufacturers. Our solutions include induction heating solutions for battery inserts and automated test equipment for the battery cells. We believe there is a strong global growth trend in EVs and that our differentiated solutions can be applied with more customers in more geographic regions. 
 
In the defense/aerospace industry, we provide ATE to prime and subcontract manufacturers to ensure quality control is maintained while also providing quicker, more accurate test times of electronic circuit boards.
 
In the life sciences industry, we provide image capture products, heating systems for medical device manufacturing and are a supplier of equipment for critical applications within the medical cold chain for pharmaceuticals.
 
In the security industry, our image capture and data management technologies are used in a broad variety of applications. 
 
The industrial market is the broadest, most diverse area we serve with a majority of our products serving a variety of applications.  Applications for our induction heating products include annealing, bonding, brazing, curing, forging, heat treating, melting and shrink-fitting. Applications for our thermal test and process products include pressure-sensor testing and cold-trap cooling for industrial processes. We believe the trend toward the use of green energy, automation, increased productivity and expanding manufacturing technology present opportunities for us to help our customers solve their complex challenges.
 
Semi Market
 The Semi Market includes both the broader semiconductor manufacturing industry as well as the more specialized semiconductor automated test equipment (“ATE”) and wafer processing sectors within the broader semiconductor market.
 
We believe the Semi Market, a highly cyclical industry historically, is currently undergoing strong growth as a result of billions of dollars of investments in new fabrication (“fab”) facilities around the world. These investments are being driven by the continued growth of the use of electronics, the need for powering an ever-growing number of devices and the continued economic development of less wealthy nations. We believe the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions have made the high concentration of semiconductor manufacturing in China and Taiwan very apparent to more wealthy nations and has spurred the investment in expansion of this industry in areas outside of these regions.
 
We serve both the front-end of the semiconductor manufacturing process at the very early stage of the development of the silicon carbide used to create wafers on which integrated circuits (“ICs”) are printed and the back-end of the semiconductor manufacturing process which includes the testing of the ICs.
 
We believe that semiconductor manufacturers remain under pressure to maximize production yields and reduce testing costs. At the same time, the growing complexity of ICs has increased the difficulty of maximizing test yields. In order to address these market trends, we believe semiconductor manufacturers strive for more effective utilization of ATE, smaller test areas and increased wafer level testing which requires our differentiated solutions that include test head manipulators, test head docking stations and test interfaces. As technology advances and ICs become increasingly more complex, we believe the need for increased capabilities in the test process should drive greater demand for our equipment. We expect that more front-end testing is going to be required in order to ensure maximum yield from the massive capital investments being made in fab expansion.
 
OUR SOLUTIONS
 
We focus our development efforts on designing and producing high quality products that provide superior performance and cost-effectiveness. We seek to address each manufacturer's individual needs through innovative and customized designs, use of the best materials available, quality manufacturing practices and personalized service. We design solutions to overcome the evolving challenges facing the Semi Market and other markets that we serve, which we believe provide the following advantages:
 
    6 

  

Temperature-Controlled Testing. Our Thermostream(R) products are used by manufacturers in a number of markets to stress test a variety of semiconductor and electronic components, printed circuit boards and sub-assemblies. Factors motivating manufacturers to use temperature testing include design characterization, failure analysis and quality control, as well as determining performance under extreme operating temperatures, all of which contribute to manufacturing cost savings. Our thermal platforms and temperature chambers, sold under our Sigma Systems product line, can accommodate large thermal masses and are found in both laboratory and production environments. Thermonics' products provide a range of precision temperature forcing systems and have been melded into Temptronic's ATS ThermoStream product line. The Thermonics brand is now used to market a family of process chillers for test and industrial applications.

Ultra-Cold Storage Solutions. With our acquisition of Z-Sciences (now North Sciences) we have expanded our product offerings to include high-performance biomedical freezer, refrigerators and mobile storage solutions that meet versatile applications, including ultra-cold storage solutions for biological sample banks, blood safety, vaccine safety, medical supplies and reagent safety.
Induction Heating. Our induction heating products are used in process applications where precision-controlled heating is needed.  Customers use our induction heating products in conjunction with other technologies in various manufacturing environments to improve production efficiencies and reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions.  Applications for our EKOHEAT(R) or EASYHEAT™ induction heating products include annealing, bonding, brazing, curing, forging, heat treating, melting, shrink-fitting and testing.
Digital Streaming and Image Capturing Solutions. Our acquisition of Videology added industrial-grade circuit board mounted digital imaging solutions, Zoom Block cameras and complete image capture systems. Videology also offers OEMs complete software solutions that are integrated into a larger system, camera systems designed to the customers’ specifications and that can interface with the customers’ software.
Scalable, Universal, High Performance Interface Technology. Our universal test head manipulators provide a high degree of positioning flexibility with a minimum amount of effort. As a result, our products can be used in virtually any test setting. Our manipulator products are designed to accommodate the increased size of test heads. Our docking hardware products offer precise control over the connection to test sockets, probing assemblies and interface boards, reducing downtime and minimizing costly damage to fragile components. Our newest manipulator and docking hardware designs offer automated capabilities that allow for reduced downtime and increased productivity through predictable and repeatable production setup with reduced risk of operator error. Our tester interface products optimize the integrity of the signals transmitted between the test head and the device under test by being virtually transparent to the test signals, which results in increased accuracy of the test data and may thus enable improved test yields.
Robotics-Based Electronic Production Test Equipment. Our acquisition of Acculogic adds to our electronic test platform offerings beyond those which exclusively serve the Semi Market. Acculogic designs and manufactures robotics-based electronic production test equipment and provides application support services which are sold to electronic manufacturers including OEM and contract electronic manufacturers as well as battery manufacturers.
Compatibility and Integration. A hallmark of our products has been, and continues to be, compatibility with a wide variety of ATE. Our manipulator and docking hardware products are all designed to be used with otherwise incompatible ATE. We believe this integrated approach to ATE facilitates smooth changeover from one tester to another, longer lives for interface components, better test results, increased ATE utilization and lower overall test costs.
Worldwide Customer Service and Support. We have long recognized the need to maintain a physical presence near our customers' facilities. As of December 31, 2021, we had manufacturing facilities in the U.S. in Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island as well as outside the U.S. in Canada, Germany and the Netherlands. We provided service to our customers from sales and service personnel based in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Our engineers are easily accessible to, and can work directly with, most of our customers from the time we begin developing our initial proposal, through the delivery, installation and use of the product by our customer. In this way, we are able to develop and maintain close relationships with our customers.

EMS Products
 Semiconductor manufacturers typically produce ICs in multiples of several hundred or more on a silicon wafer that is later separated or "diced" into individual ICs. Extended leads are then attached to the individual ICs for later connection to other electrical components. In most cases, the ICs are then encapsulated in a plastic, ceramic or other protective housing. These process steps are called "packaging."

 Wafers are tested before being diced and packaged to ensure that only properly functioning ICs are packaged. This testing step has several names, including "front-end test," "wafer test," "wafer probe" or "wafer sort." In front-end test, an electronic handling device known as a wafer prober automatically positions the wafer under a probe card that is electronically connected to a "test head," which connects electrically to a test system. During front-end testing, there is a growing trend of thermally conditioning the wafer during test. Once the good ICs have been identified, they are packaged.

 The packaged ICs also require testing, called "back-end test" or "final test," to determine if they meet design and performance specifications. Packaged ICs are tested after loading into another type of electronic handling device called a "package handler" or "handler," which then transfers the packaged ICs into a test socket that is attached to the test head. These handlers may be temperature controlled for testing.

 Testers range in price from approximately $100,000 to over $2.0 million each, depending primarily on the complexity of the IC to be tested. Probers and handlers range in price from approximately $50,000 to $500,000 each. A typical test floor of a large semiconductor manufacturer may have 100 test heads and 100 probers or 250 handlers supplied by various vendors for use at any one time. While larger global semiconductor manufacturers typically purchase ATE to test the ICs they manufacture, there are a growing number of semiconductor manufacturers who outsource IC testing to third-party foundries, test and assembly providers. 
 
Test head manipulators, also referred to as positioners, facilitate the movement of the test head to the electronic device handler. Docking hardware mechanically connects the test head to the wafer prober or handler. Tester interface products provide the electrical connection between the test head and the wafer or packaged IC. 
 
Manipulator Products. We offer three lines of manipulator products: the in2(R), the Cobal and the LS Series. These free-standing universal manipulators can hold a variety of test heads and enable an operator to reposition a test head for alternate use with any one of several probers or handlers on a test floor.
 
Our manipulator products incorporate a balanced floating-head design. This design permits a test head weighing up to 1,760 pounds to be held in an effectively weightless state, so it can be moved manually or with optional powered assistance, up or down, right or left, forward or backward and rotated around each axis (known as six degrees of motion freedom) by an operator using a modest amount of force or with a computer controlled pendant. The same design features enable the operator to dock the test head without causing inadvertent damage to the fragile electrical contacts. As a result, after testing a particular production lot of ICs, the operator can quickly and easily disconnect a test head that is held in an in2(R) or Cobal Series manipulator and equipped with our docking hardware and dock it to another electronic device handler for testing either a subsequent lot of the same packaged ICs or to test different ICs. With the LS Series manipulators, the undocking, movement of the test head and redocking can be done automatically through the computer controlled pendant. Our manipulator products generally range in price from approximately $12,000 to $85,000.
 
Docking Hardware Products. We offer two lines of docking hardware products: fixed manual docking and IntelliDock pin and cup docking. Both types protect the delicate interface contacts and ensure proper repeatable and precise alignment between the test head's interface board and the prober's probing assembly or the handler's test socket as they are brought together, or "docked." Fixed manual docking includes a mechanical cam mechanism to dock and lock the test head to the prober or handler. IntelliDock is an automated docking solution that provides operator feedback for each docking step via a touchscreen display, and when coupled with the LS Series manipulator, redeployment of the test head can be done automatically and accurately via the computer pendant. Both types of docking hardware products eliminate motion of the test head relative to the prober or handler once docked. This minimizes deterioration of the interface boards, test sockets and probing assemblies that is caused by constant vibration during testing. Our docking hardware products are used primarily with floating-head universal manipulators when maximum mobility and inter-changeability of handlers and probers between test heads is required. By using our docking hardware products, semiconductor manufacturers can achieve cost savings through improved ATE utilization, improved accuracy and integrity of test results, optimized floor support and reduced repairs and replacements of expensive ATE interface products.
 
    9 

  

We believe our docking hardware products offer our customers the ability to make various competing brands of test heads compatible with various brands of probers and handlers by only changing interface boards. This is called "plug-compatibility." Plug-compatibility enables increased flexibility and utilization of test heads, probers and handlers purchased from various ATE manufacturers. We believe that because we do not compete with ATE manufacturers in the sale of probers, handlers or testers, ATE manufacturers are willing to provide us with the information that is integral to the design of plug-compatible products. Our docking hardware products generally range in price from approximately $2,000 to $25,000.

Interface Products. Our tester interface products provide the electrical connections between the tester and the wafer prober or IC handler to carry the electrical signals between the tester and the probe card on the prober or the test socket on the handler. Our designs optimize the integrity of the transmitted signal. Therefore, our tester interfaces can be used with high speed, high frequency, digital or mixed signal testers used in testing more complex ICs. Because our tester interface products enable the tester to provide more reliable yield data, our interfaces may also reduce IC production costs. We design standard and modular interface products to address most possible tester/prober combinations on the market today. In addition, we provide a custom design service that will allow any of our customers to use virtually any tester, prober or handler combination with any type of device, such as analog, digital, mixed signal and radio frequency. For example, our Centaur(R) modular interface is designed to provide flexibility and scalability through the use of replaceable signal modules which can be easily changed on the test floor as our customers' testing requirements change. In addition to the Centaur(R) modular interface, we also offer over 200 different types of tester interface models that we custom designed for our customers' specific applications. These tester interface products generally range in price from approximately $7,000 to $175,000.
Scorpion Flying Probe Test Systems. Acculogic designs and manufactures robotics-based electronic test equipment and provides application support services for OEMs, contract electronic manufacturers and battery manufacturers. These systems are used to structurally test an electronic device. Structural testing is a confirmation that the device was manufactured properly. Acculogic’s Scorpion Flying Probe system can be quickly programmed to test almost any printed circuit board. This programming is quickly done with a digitized drawing of the device to be tested. Traditional in circuit testing systems require a dedicated fixture for each board to be tested. Acculogic’s Flying Probe system can test a virtually unlimited number of boards without any hardware modifications. These systems generally sell for between $200,000 and $600,000.
BRiZ Automated Test and Programming Services: BRiZ is an automated test platform that can consolidate any variety of circuit board test and programming into a single, compact, low-cost test station. These platforms generally sell for between $50,000 and $250,000.

CUSTOMERS
 We market all of our products to end users including semiconductor manufacturers, third-party foundries and test and assembly providers, as well as to OEMs, which include ATE manufacturers and their third-party outsource manufacturing partners. We also market our products to independent testers of semiconductors, manufacturers of automotive, defense/aerospace, industrial, life sciences and security products, semiconductor research facilities, and manufacturers and manufacturing process integrators for a variety of industrial process applications. Our customers use our products principally in production testing or process/manufacturing applications, although our ThermoStream(R) products traditionally have been used largely in engineering development and quality assurance. We believe that we sell to most of the major semiconductor manufacturers in the world.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, Texas Instruments Incorporated accounted for 13% of our consolidated revenue. While both of our operating segments sold products to this customer, this revenue was primarily generated by our EMS segment. During the year ended December 31, 2021, no other customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2020, no customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 43% and 35% of our consolidated revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The loss of any one or more of our largest customers, or a reduction in orders by a major customer, could materially reduce our revenue or otherwise materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY
 
As of December 31, 2021, our principal manufacturing operations consisted of assembly and testing at our facilities in Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. As a result of the acquisitions of Videology and Acculogic, we now have manufacturing facilities in Rhode Island, Canada, Germany and the Netherlands. We assemble most of our products from a combination of standard components and custom parts that have been fabricated to our specifications by either third-party manufacturers or our own facilities. Our practice is to use high quality raw materials and components in our products. The primary raw materials used in fabricated parts are widely available. Substantially all of our components are purchased from multiple suppliers; however, certain raw materials and components are sourced from single suppliers. Although, from time to time, certain components may be in short supply due to high demand or inability of vendors to meet quality or delivery requirements, we believe that all materials and components are available in adequate amounts from other sources.
 
We conduct inspections of incoming raw materials, fabricated parts and components using sophisticated measurement equipment. This includes testing with coordinate measuring machines in all but one of our manufacturing facilities to ensure that products with critical dimensions meet our specifications. We have designed our inspection standards to comply with applicable MIL specifications and ANSI standards.

 Our Massachusetts facility is ISO 9001:2015 certified. Our New York facility is ISO 9001:2015 certified. Our Canada facility is ISO9001:2015 certified. Our New Jersey facility manufactures products only for the semiconductor industry where ISO certification is not required. However, this location does employ the practices embodied in the ISO 9001:2008.

ENGINEERING AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
 Our success depends on our ability to provide our customers with products and solutions that are well engineered and to design those products and solutions before, or at least no later than, our competitors. As of December 31, 2021, we employed a total of 68 engineers engaged in engineering and product development. In addition, when the demands of engineering and product development projects exceed the capacity or knowledge of our in-house staff, we retain temporary third-party engineering and product development consultants to assist us. Our practice in many cases is to assign engineers to work with specific customers, thereby enabling us to develop the relationships and exchange of information that is most conducive to successful product development and enhancement. In addition, some of our engineers are assigned to new product research and development and have worked on such projects as the development of new types of universal manipulators, the redesign and development of new thermal products and the development of high-performance interfaces.

 Since most of our products are customized, we consider substantially all of our engineering activities to be engineering and product development. In the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we spent approximately $5.5 million and $5.1 million, respectively, on engineering and product development.

PATENTS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
We intend to protect our technology by filing patent applications for the technologies that we consider important to our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and unpatented know-how to protect our proprietary rights.
 
We believe our intellectual property has value, and we have taken in the past, and will take in the future, actions we deem appropriate to protect such property from misappropriation. There can be no assurance, however, that such actions will provide meaningful protection from competition. In the absence of intellectual property protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy or imitate our products or processes. For additional information regarding risks related to our intellectual property, see Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" in this Report.
 
While we believe that our patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business, we also believe that, due to the rapid pace of technological change in the markets we serve, the successful manufacture and sale of our products also depends upon our engineering, manufacturing, marketing and servicing skills.
 
It is our practice to require that all of our employees and third-party product development consultants assign to us all rights to inventions or other discoveries relating to our business that were made while working for us. In addition, all employees and third-party product development consultants agree not to disclose any private or confidential information relating to our technology, trade secrets or intellectual property.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we held 54 active U.S. patents and had three pending U.S. patent applications covering various aspects of our technology. Our U.S. patents expire at various times beginning in 2022 and extending through 2038. During 2021, no U.S. patents were issued and ten U.S. patents expired. We do not believe that the upcoming expiration of certain of our patents in 2022 will have a material impact on our business. We also hold foreign patents and file foreign patent applications, in selected cases corresponding to our U.S. patents and patent applications, to the extent management deems appropriate.

COMPETITION
 We operate in an increasingly competitive environment within both of our operating segments. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and more extensive design and production capabilities than us. Certain markets in which we operate have become more fragmented, with smaller companies entering the market. These new smaller entrants typically have much lower levels of fixed operating overhead than us, which enables them to be profitable with lower priced products. In order to remain competitive with these and other companies, we must continue to commit a significant portion of our personnel, financial resources, research and development and customer support to developing new products and maintaining customer relationships worldwide.

 Our competitors include independent manufacturers, ATE manufacturers and, to a lesser extent, semiconductor manufacturers' in-house ATE interface groups. Competitive factors in the markets we serve include price, functionality, timely product delivery, customer service, applications support, product performance and reliability. We believe that our long-term relationships with our customers in the various markets we support and our commitment to, and reputation for, providing high quality products, are important elements in our ability to compete effectively in all of our markets.
 
Our principal competitors for Thermostream(R) products are FTS Systems, a part of SP Industries, and MPI Corporation. Our principal competitors for environmental chambers are Cincinnati Sub-Zero Products, Inc., Espec Corp. and Thermotron Industries. Our principal competitor for thermal platforms is Environmental Stress Systems Inc. Our principal competitors for liquid chillers include Huber Kältemaschinenbau AG, Julabo GmbH, Boyd Corporation, and Advanced Thermal Sciences Corporation. Our principal competitors for life sciences products include Panasonic Health Care Holdings Corporation, Haier Group Corporation, Thermo Fisher Scientific Corporation, and Eppendoerf AG. Our principal competitors for EKOHEAT(R) and EASYHEAT™ products are Inductotherm Corporation, Park-Ohio Holdings, EFD Induction Corporation, Trumpf Huettinger GmbH, Ultraflex Power Technologies and CEIA SpA.

 Our digital streaming and image capturing solutions products compete in a large space with multiple small competitors. There is no competitor that has over 5% share of the current market.
 
Our principal competitors for manipulator products are Advantest Corporation, Esmo AG, Reid-Ashman Manufacturing and Teradyne, Inc. Our principal competitors for docking hardware products include Advantest Corporation, Esmo AG, Knight Automation, Reid-Ashman Manufacturing and Teradyne, Inc.

BACKLOG
 At December 31, 2021, our backlog of unfilled orders for all products was $34.1 million compared with $11.5 million at December 31, 2020. Our backlog includes customer orders that we have accepted, substantially all of which we expect to deliver in 2022. While backlog is calculated on the basis of firm purchase orders, a customer may cancel an order or accelerate or postpone currently scheduled delivery dates. Our backlog may be affected by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers, including us, in periods of depressed demand. In periods of increased demand, there is a tendency towards longer lead times, which has the effect of increasing backlog. As a result of these factors, our backlog at a particular date is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period.
EMPLOYEES
 At December 31, 2021, we had 316 employees (303 of which were full-time), including 154 in manufacturing operations, 106 in customer support/operations and 43 in administration. Substantially all of our key employees are highly skilled and trained technical personnel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. From time to time, we retain third-party contractors to assist us in manufacturing operations and engineering and product development projects.
COVID-19 PANDEMIC
 
We are following the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”) and the local regulatory authorities in regions outside the U.S. While we are no longer requiring employees to wear masks indoors in our domestic locations, we are encouraging all employees to receive COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters, if possible. We are continuing to conduct temperature screenings and encourage all employees to maintain social distancing when applicable. We are also continuing to allow employees to work remotely either part-time or full-time in circumstances when possible. While the negative impact of COVID-19 on our business was reduced significantly throughout 2021, the spread of the virus or variants of the virus could worsen and one or more of our significant customers or suppliers could be impacted, or significant additional governmental regulations and restrictions could be imposed, thus negatively impacting our business in the future. We continue to monitor the situation closely in the regions in which we operate in the U.S. and abroad and will adjust our operations as necessary to protect the health and well-being of our employees. To the extent that further governmental mandates or restrictions are implemented in the future, we currently expect to be able to continue to operate our business in a manner similar to how we have operated over the past year.
