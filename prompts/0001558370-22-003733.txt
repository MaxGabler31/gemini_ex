ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
We provide critical infrastructure-based communications and related information technology solutions to remote and historically underserved markets in the United States, Bermuda, and the Caribbean. We seek to invest in our existing and new markets for long term growth led by a “fiber first” strategy that enables us to bring new or enhanced communications services to markets often overlooked by larger telecommunications providers. 
​

1



 At the holding company level, we oversee the allocation of capital within and among our subsidiaries, affiliates, new investments, and stockholders. We also have developed significant operational expertise and resources that we use to augment the capabilities of our individual operating subsidiaries in our local markets. Over the past 10 years, we have built a platform of resources and expertise to support our operating subsidiaries and to improve their quality of service with greater economies of scale and expertise than would typically be available at the operating subsidiary level. We also provide management, technical, financial, regulatory, and marketing services to our operating subsidiaries and typically receive a management fee calculated as a percentage of their revenues, which is eliminated in consolidation. We also actively evaluate potential acquisitions, investment opportunities and other strategic transactions, both domestic and international, and generally look for those that we believe fit our profile of telecommunications businesses and have the potential to complement our “fiber first” approach in markets while generating steady excess cash flows over extended periods of time. We use the cash generated from our operations to re-invest in organic growth in our existing businesses, to make strategic investments in additional businesses, and to return cash to our investors through dividends or stock repurchases.

​
Strategy
​
Our mission is to digitally empower people and communities so that they can connect with the world and prosper. We believe that access to reliable, high-quality communications services is fundamental to the economic growth and well-being of every community. To that end, we seek to empower the local communities with the services they need to access healthcare, education, and economic opportunities by providing reliable, high speed broadband access through fiber or fiber-like services to enterprise, consumer and carrier customers. To execute on this mission, our strategy is to be a leading provider of critical network and digital infrastructure services in our current operating region, focusing in particular on historically underbuilt or poorly served areas and segments. The key elements of our strategy consist of the following:
​

● | Fiber First. We utilize a “first to fiber” smart build strategy targeting underbuilt parts of our operating area and adjacencies to “close the digital divide” in our rural or remote markets. We use a variety of approaches to accomplish this while ensuring a viable return on our investment. In our US Telecom businesses, we are connecting new communities and schools utilizing federal, state, local or tribal government funding incentives and programs, or using “anchor tenant” fiber builds for wireless carrier backhaul or large enterprise customers. In many cases, we rely on several of those subsidy or revenue sources to enable a quality and sustainable network investment. In our International Telecom segment, in some markets, we are primarily focused on increasing the capacity and capability of our core and edge networks and serving the customer base with a mixture of fixed and mobile high-speed solutions. In others, such as Guyana, we also are rapidly expanding the reach of our fiber and other high speed data solutions as demand and need grows. In evaluating investment to an under-served community, we assess the need for middle mile, enterprise and retail services 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

as part of our smart build strategy, and will offer services in one or more of these areas based on the need of the community. We believe that every community, regardless of its population size or geographic location, should experience the rich benefit of a quality digital connection.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Target Underbuilt Market Segments. We operate our communications businesses primarily in remote, rural or historically under-served markets where we are or we believe we will be one of the leading providers of communications services. We seek opportunities to build, manage, and own critical communications infrastructure in areas with high unmet demand for connectivity where we have the potential for generating substantial and steady cash flows over extended periods of time. By supplementing the business with our operational capabilities and experience at the holding company level, we are able to take on unproven markets with more difficult operating or political environments. We strive to improve and expand our product and service offerings in the locations we serve in order to better satisfy customer needs, expand our customer bases and revenues and ensure the business is efficient and economically viable.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Provide Operational Expertise in Collaboration with Local Management. We believe that strong local management enhances our close relationship with customers and reduces risk. Our businesses typically have strong local brand identities that help them become leaders in the markets they serve. Wherever feasible, we seek to partner with local investors, owners or management teams who have demonstrated a successful track record or have extensive knowledge of the industry or markets in which we operate, and who have local credibility. By maintaining these relationships and leveraging our comprehensive management experience and operational, technical, and financial expertise, we can assist these local management teams in further improving operations and growing their businesses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Disciplined Approach to Capital Allocation Designed for Long-Term Investment. We take a long-term view of our businesses, which we believe increases our chances of success and lowers risk. We have extensive transactional experience and a proven ability to source, develop, and exit investment opportunities and to take on the difficult task of integrating and optimizing acquired assets and businesses. In addition, we believe that our long, public track record of successful management and operations of critical communications networks is a key value that makes us an attractive partner for investment funds and other equity investments looking to make direct investments in businesses that own and operate communications infrastructure. When evaluating investment opportunities, both in acquisitions and organic growth, we seek out infrastructure-based services that result in steady, long-term cash flows. The durability of these businesses generates steady excess cash flows over extended periods of time that we then utilize to re-invest in organic growth in our existing businesses, make strategic investments in additional businesses, and return cash to our investors through dividends or stock repurchases. In managing our more mature businesses, we seek to solidify our brands, improve customer satisfaction, add new services, control costs and preserve cash flow. In managing newer, early-stage businesses, we seek to invest capital to improve our competitive position, increase our market share and generate strong long-term revenue and cash flow potential. We consider new investments, acquisitions and dispositions on a disciplined, return-on-investment basis.

​
International Telecom Segment
​
Communications Services
​
Our International Telecom segment generates mobility services, fixed services, carrier services, and managed services revenues in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Guyana and the US Virgin Islands. Our revenues from our International Telecom segment were approximately 57% and 72% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
​
​

Fixed Services
​
High-speed data and related services. We offer high-speed broadband services to both residential and enterprise customers in all our International Telecom markets. We provide a number of broadband internet plans with varying speeds to address different customer needs and price requirements in our various markets. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 146,000 high-speed broadband customers across our markets.
​
Voice services. We offer fixed voice services that include local exchange, regional and long distance calling and voice messaging services in Bermuda, Guyana, and the US Virgin Islands. As of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of approximately 167,000 access lines in service in our markets, which represent both residential and enterprise subscribers. With respect to our international long-distance business, we also collect payments from foreign carriers for handling international long-distance calls originating from the foreign carriers’ countries and terminating on our network. We also make payments to foreign carriers for international calls originating on one of our networks and terminating in the foreign carrier’s countries and collect from our subscribers or a local originating carrier a rate that is market-based or set by regulatory tariff.
​
Video services. We offer video services in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, and the US Virgin Islands. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 33,000 video customers across our markets. We have several offerings available to our video customers, including basic and tiered local and cable TV channels grouped into various content categories, such as news, sports and entertainment.
​
Network. We also offer our fixed services over our coaxial cable and fiber-optic networks in our international markets. All fixed access lines in our network are digitally switched from our switching centers in the US Virgin Islands, Bermuda and Guyana. Our switching centers provide dedicated monitoring of our network to ensure quality and reliable service to our customers.
​
In Bermuda and the US Virgin Islands, we deliver our services via a hybrid fiber coaxial (“HFC”) cable network and via fiber GPON network. In the Cayman Islands and Guyana, we also provide fixed services via FTTH, DSL and FWA. These networks give us expanded Internet access coverage to an average of 95% of homes across our markets with speeds up to 1 Gbps for residential customers in most markets. Following Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 (collectively, the “Hurricanes”), service to our customers over the HFC network was impacted due to both the loss of power and damage to our network. We have completed remediation efforts to our network such as building tower structures to 160 MPH ratings and adding underground and alternate routes wherever possible.
​
Our international voice and data networks link with the rest of the world principally through our ownership and investments in six undersea fiber-optic cables in the Caribbean and Atlantic regions. These cables are crucial arteries that supply access to communications services for islands and remote markets like the ones in which we operate. For example, in Guyana we co-own with Telesur, the government-owned telecommunications provider in Suriname, the Suriname-Guyana Submarine Cable System. We believe that this submarine cable system provides us with more robust redundancy, the capacity to meet growing data demands in Guyana, and the opportunity to provide new and enhanced services such as Internet service. In Bermuda, we own the Challenger Bermuda cable that provides us with capacity from Bermuda to the United States.
​
Sales and Marketing. We provide fixed services, fixed account management and fixed Wi-Fi connectivity devices through six main distribution channels: digital, company owned and operated retail/pop-up retail, authorized dealers and agents, direct sales, inside sales and telesales. B2B and B2C Customers and prospects are able to purchase any of our stand alone or bundled data and voice services, POTs, Fiber Data, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) Data, or Fixed Wireless Data thorough any of the above channels. Customers post-pay for fixed services on a monthly basis. Customers are also able to purchase devices such as Plume Home/Business mesh devices, and accessories to enhance their services through these same channels. We bundle data connectivity devices and add-on accessories similar to what is available most other countries in the world. Our sales channels are strategically located throughout our service areas manned by trained, branded, and supported sales and service representatives.
​

Competition. We compete with a limited number of other providers, including Digicel, with respect to various services. The competitive landscape in the US Virgin Islands is changing with the recently announced acquisition of Broadband VI by Liberty VI, which will consolidate two of our largest competitors in the market. We believe our breadth of services and local economies of scale provide us with a strong competitive position and the ability to win and retain an economically viable share of those markets.
​
In Guyana, we have an agreement with the Government of Guyana for the exclusive right to provide domestic fixed and international voice and data services. However, in October of 2020, the Government implemented new legislation to introduce legal competition into the sector. For further discussion regarding the change in competitive landscape following the 2020 Guyana election and new regulatory regime, see “—Guyana Regulation—Regulatory Developments” and “Risk Factors—Our operations in Guyana are subject to significant political and regulatory risk.”
​
Mobility
​
We provide mobile, data, and voice services to retail and business customers in Bermuda under the “One” brand name, in Guyana under the “GTT+” brand name and in the US Virgin Islands under the “Viya” brand name. We also provide roaming services for many of the largest US providers’ customers visiting these locations. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 336,000 mobile subscribers in our International Telecom segment and over 85% of those subscribers were on prepaid plans.
​
Products and Services. A significant majority of our customers in our International Telecom segment subscribe to one of our prepaid plans, which require customers to purchase an amount of voice minutes, text messages or data prior to use. A smaller minority of customers subscribe to our postpaid plans that allow customers to select a plan with voice minutes, text messaging, a given amount of data and other features that recur on a monthly basis, which services are billed at the end of the service period.
​
Network and Operations: We offer our mobility services over our 3G (WDCMA) 4G (LTE) wireless network in Bermuda and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In Guyana we offer our mobility services over our 2G (GSM), 3G (WCDMA) and 4G (LTE) wireless network. As of December 2021, we owned and operated a total of 454 wireless base stations in the international markets. All of our mobile networks have their core supporting facilities in the home network in the US Virgin Islands, Bermuda and Guyana. Our local NOCs provide dedicated monitoring of our network to ensure quality and reliable service to our customers and during off hours, weekends and holidays our NOC in the mainland USA provides extended support to ensure we have 24-hour, year-round monitoring of all our wireless and wireline markets. In 2021, we started the deployment of voLTE in our Bermuda market and will trial and test some 5G wireless network deployments in the US Virgin Islands in 2022.
​
The transport networks in all the markets are primarily fiber based with route diversity provided by the deployment of fiber rings where possible and supplemental microwave deployments. The vast majority of the networks are IP Based utilizing MPLS for redundancy to provide high availability networks. Standby power is provided by back up battery and generators. In the US Virgin Islands where we have experienced extreme hurricane events lots of network hardening has been added to the network such as building tower structures to 160 MPH ratings and adding underground and alternate routes wherever possible. All the markets connect to the world through sub-sea fiber networks described in our “International Telecom – Fixed – Network” section below.
​
Sales and Marketing. We provide services, mobile connectivity devices and account management through six main distribution channels: digital, Company owned retail/pop-up retail, authorized dealers /agents, direct sales, inside sales and telesales. B2B and B2C Customers and prospects are able to purchase any of our services, Prepaid Mobile, Postpaid Mobile, Mobile Data, and Mobile Money (MMG), through any of the above channels. Customers are also able to purchase devices, and accessories to enhance their services through these same channels. We offer a full suite of mobile devices and add on accessories similar to what is available in most other countries in the world. Our sales channels are strategically located throughout our service areas manned by trained, branded, and supported sales and service representatives.
​

Handsets and Accessories. We offer a diverse line of wireless devices and accessories designed to meet both the personal and professional needs of our customers. Our device assortment includes a wide range of smartphones including those featuring the Android™ and iOS™ operating systems in addition to a full line of feature phones, wireless hot spots and various wireless solutions for small businesses. To complement our phone offerings, we sell a complete range of original equipment manufacturer and after-market accessories that allow our customers to personalize their wireless experience, including phone protection, battery charging solutions and Bluetooth hands-free kits.
​
Competition. We believe we compete for wireless retail customers in our international markets based on features, price, technology deployed, network coverage (including through roaming arrangements), quality of service and customer care. We compete against Digicel and Liberty Latin America in the Caribbean region, other smaller local providers, and in some markets, against one or more US national operators.
​
US Telecom Segment
​
Communication Services
​
Our US Telecom segment generates fixed services, carrier services, mobility services, and managed services revenues in Alaska and parts of the western United States.
​
On July 22, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc. (“Alaska Communications”), for approximately $339.5 million in cash (the “Alaska Transaction”). Alaska Communications provides fixed services, carrier services and managed services to primarily carrier and enterprise customers in the State of Alaska and beyond using its statewide and interstate telecommunications network. At the same time, we entered into an agreement with affiliates and investment funds managed by Freedom 3 Capital, LLC as well as other institutional investors (collectively the “Freedom 3 Investors”) to fund the Alaska Transaction. The Freedom 3 Investors contributed approximately $71.5 million in conjunction with the Alaska Transaction (the “Freedom 3 Investment”) and Alaska Communications entered into a financing transaction drawing $220 million on new credit facilities to complete the Alaska Transaction. As a result of the Alaska Transaction, we now own approximately 52% of the common equity of Alaska Communications and control its operations and management. Beginning on July 22, 2021, the results of the Alaska Transaction are included in our US Telecom segment.
​
Our revenues from our US Telecom segment were approximately 43% and 27% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.
​
Carrier Services
​
Carrier Services. In Alaska, we provide wholesale voice and internet connectivity to carrier customers. In the western United States, we provide wholesale mobile voice and data roaming services in rural markets to national, regional, local and selected international wireless carriers as part of our carrier services as well as tower rental, backhaul and maintenance services. Our largest wholesale networks are located principally in the western United States.
​
We currently have roaming agreements with approximately 32 United States-based wireless service providers and, as of December 31, 2021, had roaming arrangements with each of the three US national wireless network carriers: Verizon Wireless, AT&T, and T-Mobile. Other than these agreements with the national carriers, our standard roaming agreements are usually terminable within 90 days. In 2021, the three national mobile service providers together accounted for a substantial portion of our carrier services revenues, with AT&T and Verizon accounting for an aggregate of approximately 16% of our total consolidated Communication Services revenue for the year.
​
The revenue and profits of our carrier services business historically were primarily driven by the number of sites and base stations in operation, the amount of voice and data traffic that each of these sites generates, and the rates we receive from our carrier customers on that traffic. Many of our sites are located in popular tourist and seasonal visitor areas, which has historically resulted in higher wholesale revenues in those areas during the summer months.
​

In the western United States, we provide wholesale transport services on a much smaller scale in rural markets to national, regional, and local communications carriers such as local exchange carriers, wireless carriers, internet service providers, wholesalers, and interstate integrated providers. We regularly participate in RFP events from other major national carriers, offering both fixed wireless and fiber-based access solutions for a myriad of E-Access solutions ranging from 50mbps to 60Gbps. In 2021, three customers, Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile accounted for 80% of our Company’s total Carrier Services revenue for the year.
​
In the western United States, we are increasingly providing network infrastructure services as part of our expanded carrier services, such as tower leasing and transport facilities to our carrier partners, to supplement our historic revenue base. In July 2019, we agreed to build a portion of AT&T’s network for the First Responder Network Authority (“FirstNet”) as well as a commercial wireless network in or near its current operating area in the Southwestern United States pursuant to a Network Build and Maintenance Agreement with AT&T (the “FirstNet Transaction”). Pursuant to the FirstNet Transaction and subject to certain limitations contained therein, all cell sites must be completed and accepted within a specified period of time, which we are working to extend with AT&T in December 2021 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other permitting related delays. Since inception of the project through December 31, 2021, we have recorded $46.8 million in construction revenue and expect to record an additional $33.0 million to $38.0 million in 2022 as sites are completed. In 2022, we also expect to record additional costs of construction revenue, as sites are completed, that will approximate that revenue. As such, revenues from construction are expected to have a minimal impact on operating income. Also pursuant to the FirstNet Transaction, AT&T has the option to repay construction costs, with interest, over an eight year period. Accordingly, we entered into a receivables credit facility with CoBank, ACB (the “Receivables Credit Facility”) to assist with this repayment option. The Receivables Credit Facility provides for a senior secured delayed draw term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $75 million with the proceeds being used to acquire the receivables related to the construction costs.
​
Following the acceptance of a cell site, AT&T owns the cell site and we assign to AT&T any third-party tower lease applicable to such cell site. If the cell site is located on a communications tower we own, AT&T pays us pursuant to a separate lease agreement for an initial term of eight years. In addition to building the network, we are providing ongoing equipment and site maintenance and high-capacity transport to and from these cell sites for an initial term ending in 2029. 
​
AT&T continues to use our wholesale domestic mobile network for roaming services at a fixed rate per site during the construction period until such time as each cell site is transferred to AT&T. After the construction period is complete, revenue from the maintenance, leasing and transport services provided to AT&T is expected to offset revenue from AT&T’s decline in usage of wholesale mobile roaming services, albeit at lower operating income margins due to the increased operating expenses associated with leasing and transport services, as compared to our wholesale mobile roaming services. We began receiving revenue from the FirstNet Transaction in the third quarter of 2019 and expect overall operating income contributions from the FirstNet Transaction to continue to have a relatively steady impact going forward.
​
Sales and Marketing. Our wholesale transport customers are predominately communications carriers such as local exchange carriers, wireless carriers, internet service providers and interstate integrated providers.
​
We believe that our ability to deliver reliable, high capacity backhaul across multiple provider footprints, both from licensed fixed wireless microwave and fiber access solutions, creates value for our customers who are typically unable to scale their rural access capacities as rapidly and successfully as they can in less remote markets. We are investing in the expansion of our regional fiber and network asset footprint, and in enhanced network reliability and route diversity, in the expectation that our carrier customers will have greater demand for higher capacity, higher reliability and lower latency backhaul to support their own investments in 5G network deployments.
​
Mobility Services
​
Mobility Services. We also offer mobile services to customers in certain rural markets already covered by our wholesale networks in the Southwestern United States. We do not offer mobility services in Alaska. We also provide private network services to enterprise and other customers. Our private 5G/LTE mobile network offering 

8



interconnects seamlessly with major mobile operators, delivering a secure, robust and flexible network and services for private applications and high-performance coverage for tenants and visitors.
​
Network and Operations. Our roaming network offers mobile communications service through a digital wireless voice and data network that utilizes multiple cellular mobile technologies including UMTS/HSPA, CDMA/EvDO and LTE that often will be deployed at a single cell site location in order to maximize revenue opportunities. We provide wireless communications network products and services with owned and leased cellular, PCS, BRS, EBS, AWS, UNII and CBRS spectrum. Our networks comprise base stations and radio transceivers located on owned or leased towers and buildings, telecommunications switches and owned or leased transport facilities. We design and construct our network in a manner intended to provide high-quality service to substantially all types of compatible wireless devices. Network reliability is carefully considered and redundancy is employed in many aspects of our network design.
​
Route diversity, redundant equipment, ring topologies, battery backup and the use of emergency standby power are used to enhance network reliability and minimize service disruptions from any particular network element failure. We operate high-capacity, carrier-class digital wireless switching systems that are capable of serving multiple markets through a single mobile telephone switching office. Centralized equipment used for network and data management is located in high-availability facilities supported by multiple levels of power and network redundancy. Our systems are designed to incorporate Internet Protocol (IP) packet-based Ethernet technology, which allows for increased data capacity and a more efficient network. Interconnection between the mobile telephone switching office and the cell sites utilizes Ethernet technology over fiber or microwave links for virtually all of our 4G LTE sites.
​
As of December 31, 2021, we owned and operated a total of approximately 1,000 domestic base stations on approximately 450 owned and leased sites, a Network Operations Center (or “NOC”), and a switching center. We also maintained a presence in numerous leased data centers designed to support network virtualization and provide network resiliency. Our NOC provides dedicated, 24-hour, year-round monitoring of our network to ensure quality and reliable service to our customers. In 2021, we continued to expand and improve our network and added UMTS to our commercial voice offering and have tested VoLTE for potential commercial deployment in 2022. VoLTE technology allows customers to utilize a 4G LTE network for both voice and data services, and the migration of our wholesale and retail subscribers in the following years to the more efficient 4G technology from 2G/3G technologies will result in increased spectrum availability.
​
Competition. With respect to our carrier services, we compete with mobile service providers that operate networks in our markets and offer wholesale roaming services. However, the most significant competitive challenge we face in our US wholesale wireless business is the extent to which our carrier customers choose not to roam on our networks or elect to build or acquire their own infrastructure in a market in which we operate, reducing or eliminating their need for our roaming services in those markets. We are addressing this competitive threat mainly by offering carrier services to build and/or maintain base stations and provide backhaul between these sites, all of which are integrated into each carrier’s native coverage. 
​
Fixed Services
​
Services. In Alaska, we provide fiber broadband and managed IT services, offering technology and service enabled customer solutions to business and wholesale customers in and out of Alaska. We also provide telecommunication services to consumers in the most populated communities throughout the state. Our facilities-based communications network connects to the contiguous states via our two diverse undersea fiber optic cable systems. We provide high-capacity data networking, internet connectivity, voice communications and IT Services. Networking services include Ethernet and IP routed services as well as switched and dedicated voice services. In addition, we offer other value-added services such as network hosting, managed IT services and long-distance services. Our network is among the most expansive in Alaska and forms the foundation of service to our customers. 
​
We operate in a largely two-player terrestrial wireline market and our customers are primarily enterprise and business customers.
​

In the southwestern United States, we provide fixed services to business customers such as schools, libraries, and internet service providers.
​
Network. In Alaska, we provide communications and IT solutions that connect Alaskans, as well as customers in the continental United States to the world. This is based on an extensive facilities-based wireline telecommunications network in Alaska that we operate. In our US operations, we continuously upgrade our network to provide higher levels of performance, higher bandwidth speeds, increased levels of security and additional value-added services to our customers. We operate 211,369 terrestrial and submarine fiber miles which serve as the backbone of our network as well as now serving over 1,036 buildings with fiber. Our networks are monitored for performance around the clock in redundant monitoring centers to provide a high level of reliability and performance. Our network is extensive within Alaska’s urban areas and connects our largest markets, including Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau with each other and the contiguous states as well as many rural areas. We continue to utilize Fixed Wireless technology to reach even more customers, bringing total homes and businesses passed to more than 18,000 at the end of 2021. In 2021, we won additional spectrum through the FCC auction for licenses in the shared Citizens Broadband Radio Service (“CBRS”). CBRS spectrum is effective in areas with lower population densities. In Alaska, we also continue to expand our Multi-Dwelling Unit (“MDU”) offering utilizing fiber or fixed wireless backhaul, with more than 7,400 MDUs now served.

We own and operate two undersea fiber optic cable systems that provide diverse routing from our Alaskan network to our facilities in Oregon and Washington. These facilities provide the most survivable service to and from Alaska, with key monitoring and disaster recovery capabilities for our customers. We also have usage rights on a third undersea fiber network connected to the continental United States. Our network in Oregon and Washington includes terrestrial transport components linking our landing stations to a Network Operations Control Center in Hillsboro, Oregon and collocation facilities in Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington. In addition, AKORN®, one of our undersea fiber optic cable systems, connects our Alaska network from Homer, Alaska to our facilities in Florence, Oregon along a diverse path within Alaska, the Pacific Northwest and undersea in the Pacific Ocean. Northstar, our other undersea fiber optic system, has cable landing facilities in Whittier, Juneau, and Valdez, Alaska, and Nedonna Beach, Oregon. In 2020, we completed major network upgrades to the Northstar fiber line, increasing capacity by more than five times. Together, our subsea fiber optic cables systems, AKORN® and Northstar, provide extensive bandwidth as well as survivability protection designed to serve our own, as well as our most demanding customers’ critical communications requirements. Through our landing stations in Oregon, we also provide an at-the-ready landing point for other large fiber optic cables, and their operators, connecting the U.S. to networks in Asia and other parts of the world.

Our terrestrial fiber network on the North Slope of Alaska allows us to provide broadband solutions to the oil and gas sector and continues to advance our sales of managed IT services. We have developed a satellite earth station network and acquired C-band transponder space on Eutelsat’s E115WB satellite to provide Internet backhaul connectivity through satellite service.
​
We have deployed, and are working to deploy more, carrier-grade fiber optic networks strategically throughout the western United States to continue to serve governmental, retail and tribal customers in Arizona and Nevada.
​
Competition. In Alaska, we face strong competition in our markets from larger competitors with substantial resources. For traditional voice and broadband services, we compete with GCI and AT&T on a statewide basis, and smaller providers such as Matanuska Telephone Association, Inc., a co-op owned telephone and internet service provider operating in the Matanuska regional area of Alaska, on a more local basis. As the largest facilities-based operator in Alaska, GCI is the dominant statewide provider of broadband, voice, wireless and video services. We believe that AT&T’s primary focus is to be the provider of voice and broadband services to its nation-wide customers and that AT&T tends to use its existing broadband network to serve these customers or it leases capacity from GCI or Alaska Communications to augment its existing network.
​
In the western United States, we experience competitive pressures from ILEC providers such as AT&T, Lumen and Frontier along with their channel partners. Similarly, national and regional fiber providers such as Zayo and Inyo Networks also offer our customers services and employ vast wholesale channel solutions as well. On a smaller scale, we also see competition from companies with cable offerings such as Spectrum and Comcast along with a few regional fiber network operators, such as Inyo Networks, Kit Carson, and Valley Communications. Our ability to offer full-service 

10



solutions starting from the site to mobile telephone switching offices continues to be market differentiator and a driver for our success.
​
In the western United States, we are continuing to expand our capacity offerings with a focus on enhancing our owned and leased transport facilities. Expansion of our network with new fiber deployments and new wholesale agreements with additional national and regional carriers for both lit and dark fiber services is facilitating a long-held vision for reducing reliance on limited capacity microwave backhaul. 
​
ATN Ventures and Minority Investments
​
In addition to our core telecommunications operating companies, we have also made investments in earlier stage businesses, some of which are noncontrolling investments whose technology-forward approach we consider strategically relevant and can also provide a variety of benefits that enhance the potential to expand our more mature businesses. These benefits include providing entry points into emerging sectors of our existing businesses, enhancing our product offerings, providing visibility into newer technologies and establishing and enhancing strategic relationships.

People and Culture
​
To support our mission of meeting the everyday needs and demands of rural and historically underserved communities with access to connectivity, we have adopted core company values, as set forth below. We developed these values internally after several working sessions with key employees and senior management to reflect both our current culture and the values that we strive to embody to attract and maintain key talent. We strive to implement these values everyday through employee engagement events, regular communication on company goals and milestones, and foster a fun and diverse workplace.

​
ATN Workforce Overview
​
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2,300 employees, of whom approximately 1,000 were employed by our international subsidiaries, and approximately 1,300 were employed in the United States (including the US Virgin Islands). At the holding company level, we employ our executive management team and staff. Approximately half of our Alaska and US Virgin Islands full-time work forces are represented by unions. Approximately 30% and 18% of our Bermuda and Guyana full-time workforce, respectively, is represented by unions. As of the end of 2021, we believe we have a good relationship with our unions.
​
Commitment to Local Management, Diversity and Inclusion
​
We rely heavily on local management teams to run our subsidiary operating units. Many of the markets in which we operate are small and remote, and in some cases are subject to government restrictions on granting work visas, all of which makes it difficult to attract and retain talented and qualified managers and staff in those markets. We work hard to maintain positive and productive working environments and we believe we have good relations with our employees and management teams.
​
It is our objective to maintain a respectful and diverse corporate culture. Our culture is driven by our core values, including our commitment to inclusion and diversity. Across our core businesses in all our markets, approximately 30% 

11



of senior management and an additional 40% of middle management identify as persons of color, including Afro-Caribbean, Latinx, Indo-Caribbean and other races or ethnicities and approximately 15% of senior management and an additional 40% of middle management are women. We are also committed to the principle of equal pay for equal work.
​
COVID-19 Response and Employee Health and Safety
​
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have prioritized the safety and well-being of our employees and our customers. Our company policy has been guided primarily by applicable government guidelines, so it has varied from market to market. In most markets, we introduced a hybrid flex model in 2021 (after offering fully remote in 2020) for any employees whose roles are appropriate for remote work. Across our company, however, we employ many essential workers (construction, maintenance, installers, and certain retail workers) whose roles require them to report to work in-person to provide the connectivity and telecommunication services to support local communities. We have supported those customer-facing essential workers by providing personal protective equipment. In addition, we have strongly encouraged all of our employees to get the COVID-19 vaccine, and in some markets have provided testing kits for certain employees. In our operations in the contiguous US, we have given employees that choose to become fully vaccinated additional paid time off.
​
Employee Engagement, Diversity and Inclusion
Our annual employee engagement survey provides employees with the opportunity to share confidential feedback on what they believe has been working well and where they believe we can improve to better support our employees. Our focus areas for engagement include skills development, manager performance, and diversity. Anonymous, aggregated results are shared with employees, and the results are used to drive our long-term action plans for how we can seek to continue to improve our work culture.
ATN International and our subsidiaries are working hard to improve the way technology is used in the diverse communities we serve. We believe having management and staff that are as diverse as the communities in which they operate is crucial to our success and to our ability to have a positive impact on those communities. We celebrate different perspectives and backgrounds because we believe they help us to have a stronger, more creative, and more successful workplace.

Regulation
​
Our wireless and wireline telecommunications and video services operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide services. Our wireless and wireline operations and our video services operations in the United States and the US Virgin Islands are governed by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”); the implementing regulations adopted thereunder by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), including the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as well as judicial and regulatory decisions interpreting and implementing the Communications Act; and other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. Our operations are also governed by certain foreign laws and regulations.
The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation does not purport to describe all present and proposed federal, state, local, and foreign regulation and legislation that may affect our businesses. Legislative or regulatory requirements currently applicable to our businesses may change in the future and legislative or regulatory requirements may be adopted by those jurisdictions that currently have none. Any such changes could impose new obligations on us that could adversely affect our operating results.

US Federal Regulation
At the federal level, we are regulated in large part by the FCC. 
​
​

Mobility Services
​
The FCC regulates, among other things, the licensed and unlicensed use of radio spectrum; the ownership, lease, transfer of control and assignment of wireless licenses; the ongoing technical, operational, and service requirements applicable to such licenses; the timing, nature, and scope of network construction; the provision of certain services, such as enhanced 911 (“E-911”); and the interconnection of communications networks in the United States.


Licenses. We provide our wireless services pursuant to various commercial mobile radio services (“CMRS”) licenses, including cellular, broadband Personal Communications Services (“PCS”), 600 MHz Band, 700 MHz Band, Advanced Wireless Service (“AWS”), Broadband Radio Service (“BRS”) and Educational Broadband Service (“EBS”) licenses granted by the FCC, and pursuant to leases of spectrum from FCC licensed operators. Some of these licenses are site based while others cover specified geographic market areas, e.g., Cellular Market Areas, Basic Trading Areas, and Partial Economic Areas, as defined by the FCC. The specific radio frequencies, the authorized spectrum amounts, and certain of the technical and service rules vary depending on the licensed service. The FCC generally allocates CMRS licenses through periodic auctions, after determining how many licenses to make available in particular frequency ranges, the applicable service rules, and the terms on which the license auction will be conducted. Such licenses are also available via secondary market mechanisms, using procedures and regulations set forth by the FCC. The FCC has conducted auctions of high-band and mid-band spectrum in recent years, and is considering holding a further mid-band spectrum auction in 2022. There is no certainty as to whether any of this spectrum will be used for wireless services competitive with our services or as to the likelihood that we will acquire spectrum licenses made available in any future auction.
​
In the FCC’s 2020 auction of Citizen’s Band Radio Service (“CBRS”) Priority Access Licenses (“PALS”) in the 3.5 GHz band, which are licensed on a county-by-county basis and awarded for a 10-year term, we won licenses in 590 U.S. counties at a total cost of approximately $20.4 million. Once these licenses are awarded, we will have to achieve certain CBRS spectrum band build out obligations. We currently expect to comply with all applicable requirements related to these licenses.
​
Construction Obligations. The FCC conditions licenses on the satisfaction of certain obligations to construct networks covering a specified geographic area or population by specific dates. The obligations vary depending on the licensed service. Failure to satisfy an applicable construction requirement can result in the assessment of fines and forfeitures by the FCC, a reduced license term, or automatic license cancellation. We are substantially in compliance with the applicable construction requirements that have arisen for the licenses we currently hold and expect to meet our future construction requirements as well. 
​
License Renewals. Our FCC licenses generally expire between 2022 and 2031 and are renewable upon application to the FCC. License renewal applications may be denied if the FCC determines, after appropriate notice and hearing, that renewal would not serve the public interest, convenience, or necessity. At the time of renewal, we must demonstrate that we have maintained operations (and service in some instances) at or above levels needed to satisfy our construction requirements, that we have not permanently discontinued operations at any time during our prior license term, and that we have substantially complied with the rules and regulations of the FCC and the Communications Act. If we are able to make these certifications, we may claim a license renewal safe harbor. If we cannot make these certifications, we must instead file a license renewal showing how we have used our license during our prior license term, which the FCC has broad discretion to approve or deny. If a renewal showing is denied, our license renewal application will be dismissed, and our license will not be renewed for an additional license term. While our licenses have been renewed regularly by the FCC in the past and, to our knowledge, no circumstances exist that warrant non-renewal, there can be no assurance that all of our licenses will be renewed in the future. 
​
The FCC may deny license applications and, in extreme cases, revoke licenses if it finds that an entity lacks the requisite qualifications to be a licensee. In making that determination, the FCC considers whether an applicant or licensee has been the subject of adverse findings in a judicial or administrative proceeding involving felonies, the possession or sale of unlawful drugs, fraud, antitrust violations, or unfair competition, employment discrimination, misrepresentations to the FCC or other government agencies, or serious violations of the Communications Act or FCC 

13



regulations. To our knowledge, there are no activities and no judicial or administrative proceedings involving either us or the licensees in which we hold a controlling interest that would warrant such a finding by the FCC.
​
License Acquisitions. Prior FCC approval typically is required for transfers or assignments of a controlling interest in any license or construction permit or of any rights thereunder. The FCC may approve or prohibit such transactions altogether or approve such transactions subject to certain conditions such as divestitures or other requirements. Noncontrolling minority interests in an entity that holds an FCC license generally may be bought or sold without FCC approval, subject to any applicable FCC notification requirements. The FCC permits licensees to lease spectrum to third parties under certain conditions, subject to prior FCC approval, or in some instances, notification to the FCC. These mechanisms provide additional flexibility for wireless providers to structure transactions and create additional business and investment opportunities, and, like our competitors, we will monitor and pursue opportunities to obtain additional spectrum licenses. With the exception of the FCC’s spectrum aggregation screen in certain markets, which is discussed below, there are no circumstances, to our knowledge, that would prevent the FCC from approving our acquisition of additional spectrum licenses.
​
The FCC no longer caps the amount of CMRS spectrum in which an entity may hold an attributable interest and now instead engages in a case-by-case review of proposed wireless transactions, including spectrum acquired via auction, to ensure that the proposed transaction serves the public interest and would not result in a rule violation or an undue concentration of market power. The FCC utilizes a spectrum aggregation “screen” to determine whether a proposed secondary market transaction requires additional scrutiny. Under this approach, a transaction will be reviewed by the FCC for potential competitive effects if it will result in the acquiring entity having (1) total spectrum holdings generally exceeding approximately one-third of the total amount of suitable and available spectrum in any county (which the FCC raised in 2021 from 250 MHz to 350 MHz) or (2) over 68 MHz of spectrum under 1 GHz. The FCC’s additional scrutiny would also be triggered if a proposed transaction results in a material change in the post transaction market share in a particular market as measured by the Herfindahl Hirschman Index. We are well below the spectrum aggregation screen in the majority of geographic areas in which we hold or have access to licenses, and thus we may be able to acquire additional spectrum either from the FCC in an auction or from third parties in private transactions in most locations in which we operate. However, we could trigger the spectrum screen if we attempt to acquire additional covered spectrum in the US Virgin Islands. 
​
Other Requirements. The Communications Act and the FCC’s rules impose a number of additional requirements upon wireless service providers. A failure to meet or maintain compliance with the Communications Act and/or the FCC’s rules may subject us to fines, forfeitures, penalties or other sanctions.
​
Wireless licensees must satisfy a variety of FCC requirements relating to technical and reporting matters. Licensees must often coordinate frequency usage with adjacent licensees and permittees to avoid interference between adjacent systems. In addition, the height and power of transmitting facilities and the type of signals emitted must fall within specified parameters. For certain licensed services, a variety of incumbent government and non-government operations may have to be relocated before a licensee may commence operations, which may trigger the incurrence of relocation costs by the incoming licensee. To our knowledge, we comply in all material respects with applicable FCC technical and reporting requirements.
​
The radio systems towers that we own and lease are subject to Federal Aviation Administration and FCC regulations that govern the location, marking, lighting and construction of towers and are subject to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and other environmental statutes enforced by the FCC. The FCC has also adopted guidelines and methods for evaluating human exposure to radiofrequency field emissions from radio equipment. To our knowledge, all of our radio systems on towers that we own or lease comply in all material respects with these requirements, guidelines, and methods.
​
The FCC has adopted requirements for cellular, PCS, and other CMRS providers to implement basic 911 and E-911 services. These services provide state and local emergency service providers with the ability to better identify and locate 911 callers using wireless services, including callers using special devices for the hearing impaired. Because the implementation of these obligations requires that the local emergency services provider have certain facilities available, our specific obligations are set on a market-by-market basis as emergency service providers request the implementation 

14



of E-911 services within their locales. As part of an E-911 initiative, the FCC adopted stronger rules regarding E-911 location accuracy that will become effective in 2022, and the FCC continues to evaluate the potential for improving location accuracy for 911 calls. We anticipate complying with all wireless E-911 obligations applicable to our operations, but the extent to which we are required to deploy E-911 services will affect our capital spending obligations. Federal law limits our liability for uncompleted 911 calls to a degree commensurate with wireline carriers in our markets.
​
The FCC also has adopted rules requiring wireless carriers and certain other text messaging service providers to provide text-to-911 service and an automatic “bounce back” text message to consumers who try to text 911 where text to 911 is not available, indicating the unavailability of such services. Like E-911 services, the obligation to provide these services is largely tied to requests from emergency service providers for these services. We are currently in compliance with all public safety answering point requests we have received. The FCC has also sought further comment regarding additional regulations pertaining to the provision of text to 911 service.
​
The FCC established a Wireless Emergency Alerts system that allows CMRS providers to transmit emergency alerts to the public. This system is voluntary. The rules governing participation contain many requirements, such as point of sale disclosures, geo-targeting alerts, alert logging, maximum message lengths, alert preservation, alerts regarding threats to police officers, and support for non- English messages. We have partially opted in to the service and are currently providing it to all of our retail wireless customers to the extent required by applicable regulations and where technically feasible. 
​
The FCC’s rules require CMRS providers to offer “roaming” services to other providers. Roaming enables one provider’s customers to obtain service from another provider when the customer is using their wireless device in an area served by the second provider. These rules apply to voice, messaging, and data services, including Internet access, although the roaming rules vary somewhat among these services. We are obligated to offer roaming, and we have the right to seek roaming from other providers, on reasonable terms and conditions. The FCC has identified a variety of factors that are relevant to whether an offer to provide roaming is reasonable, including the price, terms and conditions, and whether the two providers’ networks are technologically compatible. Changes in the FCC’s roaming regulations may affect the terms under which we provide roaming services to third parties and may affect our ability to secure roaming arrangements with other CMRS providers on behalf of our retail wireless customers.
​
In addition to CMRS licenses, our wireless business relies on common carrier and non-common carrier fixed point-to-point microwave licenses issued by the FCC. We currently operate over 490 licensed microwave links. Microwave stations are generally used in a point-to-point configurations for cellular site backhaul connections or to connect points on the telephone network that cannot be cost effectively connected using standard wireline or fiber optic cable because of cost or terrain. The majority of our license grants are for a period of 10 years. To our knowledge, no circumstances exist that warrant non-renewal of our microwave licenses, but there can be no assurance that all of our licenses will be renewed in the future.
​
We are obligated to pay certain annual regulatory fees and assessments to support FCC wireless industry regulation, as well as fees supporting federal universal service programs, number portability, regional database costs, centralized telephone numbering administration, telecommunications relay service for the hearing impaired and application filing fees. These fees are subject to change periodically by the FCC and the manner in which carriers may recoup these fees from customers is subject to various restrictions. To our knowledge, we comply in all material respects with applicable FCC regulatory fee and assessment requirements.
​
Fixed Services
​
The FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over the interstate and international telecommunications services that we provide as a regulated common carrier in Alaska and the US Virgin Islands. The Communications Act and regulations promulgated thereunder require, among other things, that we offer regulated interstate telecommunications common carrier services at just, reasonable and non-discriminatory rates and terms. The Communications Act also requires us to offer competing carriers interconnection and non-discriminatory access to certain facilities and services designated as essential for local competition. 

15



​
We are subject to competitive market forces, as well as rate-of-return regulations for intrastate services that originate and terminate in Alaska and the US Virgin Islands and price-cap rate regulation for interstate services in Alaska regulated by the FCC. Because we face competition, we may not be able to charge the maximum permitted rates under price-cap regulation or realize their authorized intrastate rate of return. A broader range of data and information services are offered by our unregulated affiliates or as unregulated services by our regulated companies.

The FCC also regulates the prices that we charge for the use of our local telephone facilities in originating or terminating interstate calls. In Alaska, rates for interstate telecommunications services we offer are determined using price cap regulation, under which the rates vary from year to year based on mathematical formulae, and not based on changes to our costs, including both inter-carrier rates and retail end user rates. On April 20, 2017, the FCC adopted an Order updating its regulations governing “business data services,” which are those circuit-switched or packet-switched services that offer dedicated point-to-point transmission of data at certain guaranteed speeds and service levels using high-capacity connections, including special access services. The FCC left in place the Phase I and Phase II pricing flexibility it granted to us in 2010 and granted further price deregulation of all business data services with transmission speeds above 45 Megabits per second. For legacy circuit-switched business data services with speeds at or below that level (DS-3 or below), the FCC adopted a new competitive market test, finding that price regulation is no longer required in counties (or county-equivalents, such as Alaskan boroughs) where the test is satisfied. We expect this FCC Order to support our ability to be market competitive for our business data services in many of our most competitive markets.

On August 28, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated portions of the FCC’s decision that ended prior regulation and tariffing of prices of legacy circuit-switched transport services offered by price cap carriers, like Alaska Communications, because it found that the FCC had not provided sufficient advance notice of that aspect of its decision. On July 12, 2019, following additional proceedings, the FCC re-adopted the majority of the forbearance relief that the Eighth Circuit had vacated, while leaving rate regulation in place on certain routes that the FCC believed to lack sufficient competition.
​
Call Authentication. On March 31, 2020, the FCC issued a Report and Order implementing the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act by mandating that voice service providers such as our Alaska and US Virgin Islands businesses implement a new framework in the Internet Protocol (IP) portions of their networks by June 30, 2021. Among other things, the TRACED Act seeks to reduce the number of unwanted calls (“robocalls”) in which the calling party deceives the recipient by falsifying the Caller ID information to make it appear that the call is from someone the recipient knows or can trust. To do so, the TRACED Act directs the FCC to require all voice service providers to implement new standards developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) for authenticating and verifying caller ID information for calls carried in the IP portions of their networks, and implement an effective caller ID authentication framework in the non-IP portions of their networks. As of June 30, 2021, we have been in compliance with the these requirements.

National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. On July 16, 2020, the FCC adopted a Report and Order designating the three-digit code “988” as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, and directed all service providers to enable use of that code to reach suicide prevention and crisis intervention services no later than July 16, 2022. There are 87 area codes across the country, including the “907” area code used throughout Alaska, where local calls may be dialed using seven digits, and where “988” is used as a three-digit telephone exchange prefix. To ensure that calls are not erroneously routed to the National Suicide Prevention Hotline when a user intends to dial a seven-digit call starting with “988,” the FCC required all 87 of the affected area codes to transition to ten-digit dialing for all calls during the transition period. As a result of these changes, Alaska Communications is in the process of upgrading and reprograming its switches throughout the state, and assist with consumer education efforts with respect to these new dialing patterns.

The Communications Act encourages competition in local telecommunications markets by removing barriers to market entry and imposing on non-rural incumbent local exchange carriers (“ILECs”) various requirements related to, among other things, interconnection, access to unbundled network elements, co-location, access to poles, ducts, conduits, and rights of way, wholesale and resale obligations, and telephone number portability. Our ILEC operations in the US Virgin Islands through Viya are exempt from most such federal requirements pursuant to a rural exemption.
​

16



While, to date, the FCC has declined to classify interconnected voice-over Internet protocol (“VoIP”) service as a telecommunications service or information service, it has imposed a number of consumer protection and public safety obligations on interconnected VoIP providers, relying in large part on its general ancillary jurisdiction powers. To the extent that we provide interconnected VoIP service, we are subject to a number of these obligations, and, to our knowledge, we comply in all material respects with applicable VoIP requirements.
​
In recent years, the FCC has taken actions to help expedite the deployment of wireline (and wireless) network infrastructure. Those actions include adopting rules to facilitate the attachment of new facilities to utility poles and eliminating or reducing requirements to provide notice of service discontinuance. We expect these FCC actions will facilitate our ability to expand our wireline network coverage. 
​
Video Services
​
Video services systems are regulated by the FCC under the Communications Act. We provide video services in the US Virgin Islands. The FCC regulates our programming selection through local broadcast TV station mandatory carriage obligations, constraints on our retransmission consent negotiations with local broadcast TV stations, and limited regulation of our carriage negotiations with cable programming networks. The FCC and federal laws also impose rules governing, among other things, leased cable set-top boxes, our ability to collect and disclose subscribers’ personally identifiable information, access to inside wiring in multiple dwelling units, cable pole attachments, customer service and technical standards, and disability access requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to penalties. The FCC is examining whether it should modernize its video regulations and already has updated or eliminated some requirements, but we cannot predict whether and to what extent the FCC will continue to pursue deregulation in this space. To our knowledge, we comply in all material respects with applicable FCC video services requirements.
​
Mobility and Fixed Services
​
Universal Service. In general, all telecommunications providers are obligated to contribute to the Universal Service Fund (“USF”), which is used to promote the availability of qualifying telecommunications and broadband service to individuals and families qualifying for federal assistance, households located in rural and high cost areas and to schools, libraries, and rural health care providers. Contributions to the federal USF are based on end-user interstate and international telecommunications revenue. Some states have similar programs that also require contribution. The FCC has suggested that it may examine the way in which it collects carrier contributions to the USF, including a proposal to base collections on the number of telephone numbers or network connections in use by each carrier, and some states have changed or are considering changing their contribution methodologies. We contribute to the USF as required by the rules throughout the US, and receive funds from the USF for providing service in rural areas of the United States, including the US Virgin Islands. Consequently, changes to federal or state USF programs could affect our revenues and our end-user charges. We are subject to audit by the Universal Service Administration Company with respect to our federal contributions and our receipts of universal service funding. To our knowledge, we comply in all material respects with applicable federal and state USF assessment and support requirements.
​
In 2011, the FCC released a Transformation Order that established a new framework for high cost universal service support for price capped carriers that replaced existing support mechanisms that provide support to carriers that serve high-cost areas with new Connect America Fund (“CAF”) support mechanisms and service obligations that are focused on broadband Internet access services. The Transformation Order also replaced the FCC’s previous set of explicit high-cost universal service support mechanisms for price cap carriers, like Alaska Communications, with the CAF. While the previous mechanisms were focused on supporting a portion of the cost of providing voice telephone service, the CAF shifted that focus to expanding the availability of affordable broadband services. On October 31, 2016, the FCC released its order establishing the requirements of CAF II (“CAF II”) for price cap carriers in Alaska, and specifically Alaska Communications, the only price cap carrier in Alaska. Under the CAF II order, we receive approximately $19.7 million annually in Alaska through December 31, 2025, subject to explicit broadband deployment conditions.
​

In August 2018, we were separately awarded $79.9 million over 10 years by the FCC as part of its Connect America Fund Phase II (“CAF II”) USF auction for our operations in the southwestern United States. The funding requires us to provide fixed broadband and voice services to certain eligible areas in the United States. We are subject to operational and reporting requirements under the program. Funding began in the second quarter of 2019 and we record the amounts received as revenue in our financial statements. In addition, in the 2020 Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Phase I (“RDOF”) auction, we were awarded $28.4 million and accepted $20.1 million over 10 years. We declined to accept the remaining support, and we will owe default penalties with respect to these winning bids. We are obligated to provide broadband and voice services to certain areas in the United States attached to our RDOF winning bids.

We are continuing to work toward meeting our CAF II obligations in a capital-efficient manner, including the delivery of broadband Internet access services meeting CAF II requirements using a fixed wireless platform and in some instances in Alaska, DSL. As of December 31, 2021, we have met 60% of the total number of locations served required by December 31, 2025 under Alaska CAF II and serve more than 40% of the population required to be served in its southwestern United States CAF II build.
​
In 2018, the FCC initiated a proceeding to reform the USF program for high cost in the USVI and Puerto Rico. In September 2019, the FCC adopted an order in this proceeding establishing a new competitive proposal process for awarding Connect USVI Fund support that would supplant the annual support that Viya received. Viya submitted a bid for Connect USVI Fund support allocated for the US Virgin Islands, but on November 16, 2020, the FCC announced that Viya was not the recipient of the award. As a result, Viya’s USF support was reduced to 2/3 of the legacy total amount, or $10.9 million, from August 2021 through July 2022 and to 1/3 of the legacy total amount, or $5.5 million, during the subsequent 12-month period. Thereafter, Viya will not receive high-cost USF support. 
​
Rural Health Care Universal Service Support Program. The FCC’s Rural Health Care Universal Service Support Mechanism (the “RHC program”) provides funding to help make broadband telecommunications and Internet access services provided by us and other service providers affordable for eligible rural health care providers. It is comprised of two parts. The Telecommunications Program covers the difference between the “urban rate” for telecommunications services that rural healthcare providers use to deliver healthcare at rural locations, and the “rural rate” that they would otherwise be required to pay. The Healthcare Connect Fund covers 65 percent of the cost of a wider variety of broadband telecommunications, networking, and Internet access services and certain associated equipment. 

For the 2017 Funding Year, the FCC approved rural rates that were significantly reduced from the rates proposed by us in Alaska. For Funding Years 2018, 2019, and 2020, we have likewise obtained FCC approval for our rural rates, generally at levels consistent with the reduced rates approved by the FCC for Funding Year 2017. The multi-step process of obtaining FCC approval for rates and then subsequently obtaining funding commitment letters from USAC has introduced varying degrees of delay and uncertainty in the process of obtaining support for the services we deliver to rural health care providers. 

On August 1, 2019, the FCC adopted an order making comprehensive changes to the rules governing the competitive bidding process and the method for determining the urban and rural rates used to calculate the amount of RHC Telecommunications Program support payments for which a health care provider is eligible. The changes to the urban and rural rate rules take effect for Funding Year 2021, which began July 1, 2021. Among other things, the FCC’s Order directed USAC to develop and publish a database containing available rural rates and rate medians that will cap the amount of RHC support eligible healthcare providers may receive for a given service in a particular geographic zone. The FCC’s Order divided Alaska into four geographic zones, with the rural rate in each zone capped at the median of the rural rates for similar services offered in that zone, as identified by USAC. On October 21, 2019, an appeal challenging the new method of setting rates for supported services was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, adding further uncertainty to the ultimate outcome of this proceeding. Similarly, we and several other parties have filed Petitions for Reconsideration of the FCC’s August 2019 Report and Order, asking the FCC to reconsider some of its changes to the rural healthcare rate-setting process. Both the action in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Petitions for Reconsideration filed with the FCC remain pending.

We believe that USAC’s rural rate database, as currently constituted, is likely to have an adverse impact on our economic ability to continue to serve some of our rural healthcare customers in Alaska. In particular, the rates established by the database would negatively impact our ability to continue to offer our full range of telecommunications services to rural healthcare providers supported by the Telecommunications Program in the more remote, higher-cost areas of the state. We have requested that the full FCC review USAC’s effort and associated guidance concerning the database, delay the effectiveness of the new rural rates, and direct USAC to implement the changes we requested in our Petition for Reconsideration. On January 19, 2021, the FCC issued an order waiving the use of the database in Alaska for Funding Years 2021 and 2022. In lieu of the database, while the waiver remains in effect, the Order authorizes support based on the most recent rural rate that the FCC has approved for the same service at the same healthcare facility within the past three funding years. As an alternative, Telecommunications Program rural rates may be established under the previously applicable rate rules that were in effect through Funding Year 2020. As with the action in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Petitions for Reconsideration, the other issues raised in our Application for Review remain pending.

We are unable to predict the outcome or eventual impact of the D.C. Circuit’s review of the FCC’s Order, or the FCC’s decision on our Petition for Reconsideration or our Application for Review, but the January 2021 waiver offers a measure of short-term stability for the Telecommunications Program while those reviews continue.

USAC Audit of RHC Program Funding Requests. In addition to the prospective changes to the RHC program discussed above, the FCC and USAC have periodically undertaken reviews of current and past funding requests. In June 2017, we received a letter from USAC’s auditors inquiring about past funding requests in Alaska, all of which were previously approved by USAC. After clarifying the request, and correspondence with USAC we received in February 2020 a draft audit report from USAC that is described more fully in Note 13 “Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The draft audit report alleges violations of the FCC’s rules for establishing rural rates and urban rates, the provisioning and billing of ineligible services and products, and violations of the FCC’s competitive bidding rules. We were invited to comment on this draft audit report and have been engaged since that time in correspondence with USAC with respect to its requests. As a result of these conversations and comments being submitted by us, USAC’s auditors are expected to issue a final audit report incorporating our responses that will be sent to USAC’s Rural Health Care Division to review and determine if corrective action would be appropriate. In the event that we disagree with USAC’s final audit report, we can appeal that decision to USAC’s Rural Health Care Division and/or the FCC. At this time, we cannot predict the contents or timing of the final USAC audit report, the outcome of the audit or the impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

FCC Inquiry into Company’s RHC Program Participation. We also received a Letter of Inquiry in March 2018 from the FCC Enforcement Bureau requesting historical information regarding our participation in the FCC’s Rural Health Care program. To date, we have continued to supply the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau with information and access to our personnel regarding these inquires and the Enforcement Bureau has not asserted any claims or alleged any rule violations. We continue to work constructively with the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau to provide it the information it is seeking. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of the FCC Enforcement Bureau’s inquiry or the impact it may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

 Lifeline. The FCC’s Lifeline support mechanism today subsidizes the cost of voice services for low-income consumers, as well as broadband in CAF II locations.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 appropriated $3.2 billion to create the “Emergency Broadband Connectivity Fund,” and directed the FCC to use that fund to establish a new “Emergency Broadband Benefit Program” (“EBBP”). The EBBP provides eligible low-income consumers and students with a monthly subsidy for the purchase of broadband Internet access service from service providers that elect to participate in the program. While the monthly subsidy is $50 in most of the nation, the EBBP provides $75 monthly throughout the state of Alaska and our operations on the Navajo Nation, which is encompassed within the statute’s definition of “Tribal lands.” Due to the statutorily short term of the EBBP, the FCC initiated the Affordable Connectivity Program to extend the duration and benefits of the EBBP. The SCP is effective on January 1, 2022, on substantially the same terms and conditions as the EBBP. The EBBP sunset on March 1, 2022 and is being replaced by the Affordable Connectivity Program.

E-Rate. We have provided telecommunications services, broadband Internet access services, and internal connections supported by the FCC’s Schools and Libraries Universal Service Support Mechanism (“E-rate”) for many years. E-rate support provides an invaluable means by which elementary and secondary schools in Alaska can afford those services, particularly in rural and remote, high-cost areas. Historically, E-rate has primarily supported services that connect eligible school buildings
​
Net Neutrality. In January 2018, the FCC released a decision rescinding various “net neutrality” requirements, which had governed how broadband Internet access providers were permitted to offer broadband service. This decision largely eliminated the FCC’s regulation of our ability to block, throttle, or prioritize specific types of Internet traffic, and put a revised transparency-centered regulatory regime in place. Under the 2018 decision’s approach, broadband Internet access providers still must publicly disclose detailed information regarding their service offerings, Internet traffic management processes, and other practices affecting broadband customers. The FCC also held that states are preempted from enacting their own versions of these or similar requirements. A federal appeals court upheld most of the FCC’s 2018 decision, but it reversed the FCC’s blanket preemption of state broadband rules. The court also (1) held that state broadband laws only may be preempted on a case-by-case basis when they conflict with state or federal policy, and (2) remanded certain issues to the FCC. The court subsequently declined to rehear the case, and no party sought review by the U.S. Supreme Court. In October 2020, the FCC affirmed its 2018 decision after addressing the issues remanded by the court. That decision is subject to petitions for reconsideration before the FCC (which the agency has not acted on) and a challenge in federal court that currently is on hold. A new Chairwoman of the FCC was appointed in December 2021, and she has stated publicly that she supports the FCC once again adopting net neutrality requirements. 
​
Meanwhile, a number of states have adopted – or are considering – state-level net neutrality requirements, some of which have gone into effect and some of which are stayed and enjoined. These efforts include enacted legislation and executive orders dating back to 2018. Some state efforts are currently subject to legal challenge by broadband providers in federal district court. These legal challenges were paused during the appellate proceedings on the FCC’s 2018 decision, but have now resumed. We cannot predict with any certainty the likely timing or outcome of these or future challenges, how state or federal efforts to adopt net neutrality requirements will continue to evolve, or how these regulatory proceedings will impact our business.
​
Telecommunications Privacy Regulations. We are subject to federal regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business. Certain federal statutory and regulatory privacy and data security requirements apply to our telecommunications and cable services. Other parts of our business are subject to privacy and data security oversight by other federal regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission. In addition, federal and state regulators have adopted or are considering adopting new privacy laws. For instance, the state of California has enacted two broad new privacy statutes, the first effective January 1, 2020, and the second effective January 1, 2023, although we do not believe that they are applicable to our business. Such state privacy regulations could impact at least some of our operations. We believe that we comply with all currently applicable requirements, but we cannot predict the timeline for any future changes of law in this area or the impact of any such changes on our businesses.
​
CALEA. Under certain circumstances, federal law also requires telecommunications carriers to provide law enforcement agencies with capacity and technical capabilities to support lawful wiretaps pursuant to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (“CALEA”). Federal law also requires compliance with wiretap related record keeping and personnel related obligations. The FCC has adopted rules that apply CALEA obligations to high-speed Internet access and VoIP services. We believe that we are in compliance with all such requirements currently applicable to us. Maintaining compliance with these law enforcement requirements may impose additional capital spending obligations on us to make necessary system upgrades.
​
Satellite Services

On February 16, 2018, the FCC granted our application for a license to operate a network of C-band satellite earth stations to be used to serve our customers that cannot be reached by terrestrial middle mile facilities. Under that license, we are authorized to use C-band spectrum on Eutelsat’s satellite, E115WB, for a term of 15 years. We have steadily expanded this network to serve over 40 sites, primarily in rural and remote areas of Alaska. We expect this 

20



approach to provide us with greater predictability and stability in the availability and cost of long-haul transport connectivity to our customers that must be served by satellite.

On March 3, 2020, the FCC released a Report and Order clearing the lower portion of that band (3.7-4.0 GHz) of virtually all satellite services in the 48 contiguous United States and the District of Columbia. The Report and Order allows continued use of that spectrum for satellite services in other areas of the nation, including Alaska, essentially preserving the status quo. As a result, the FCC’s decision has little to no effect on our authority to continue to offer C-band satellite communications services to our Alaska customers.
​
US State Regulation
​
Wireless Services
​
Federal law generally preempts state and local regulation of the entry of, or the rates charged by, any CMRS provider. For this reason, as a practical matter, we are generally free to establish wireless rates and offer new wireless products and services, and our wireless businesses are subject to minimal state regulatory requirements. However, the states in which we operate maintain nominal oversight jurisdiction. For example, states may regulate the “terms and conditions” of a CMRS provider’s service other than rates. States and localities also assess taxes and fees on wireless carriers.
​
The location and construction of our wireless transmission towers and antennas are subject to state and local environmental regulation, as well as state or local zoning, land use and other regulation. Before we can put a system into commercial operation or expand a system, we must obtain all necessary zoning and building permit approvals for the cell site and tower locations. The time needed to obtain zoning approvals and requisite permits varies from market to market and state to state. Likewise, variations exist in local zoning processes. If zoning approval or requisite state permits cannot be obtained, or if environmental rules make construction impossible or infeasible on a particular site, our network design might be adversely affected, network design costs could increase and the service provided to our customers might be limited.
​
In recent years, the FCC has taken actions to help expedite the deployment of wireless network infrastructure. Those actions include limiting state and local regulations governing the construction or modification of towers and the installation of small cells and other facilities within and outside public rights-of-way when the FCC determines those regulations can be barriers to deployment. Among other things, the FCC established new shorter shot clocks for completion of local reviews of small wireless facility applications, and required that fees which states and localities may charge for the location of small cells in rights-of-way must be cost-based. Several of the FCC’s most recent decisions were challenged in court by individual localities and organizations representing local governments. While some of the FCC’s actions have been upheld, others have been vacated or remanded, and others remain subject to petitions for reconsideration or appeal. We cannot predict with certainty the likely timing or outcome of these challenges.

Alaska Regulation
​
Providers of intrastate telecommunication services in Alaska are required to obtain certificates of public convenience and necessity from the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (the “RCA”). In addition, RCA approval is required if an entity acquires a controlling interest in any of our certificated subsidiaries, acquires a controlling interest in another intrastate utility or discontinues intrastate service. On August 29, 2019, the Governor of Alaska signed into law new legislation that eliminated the requirement for Alaska Communications to maintain RCA-filed tariffs for rates, terms, and conditions for legacy phone and networking services in Alaska, However, rates, terms, and conditions for basic residential local telephone service must, under the bill, be uniform within each study area. Alaska Communications implemented changes to tariffs, terms and conditions and other service related policies effective November 27, 2019.
Alaska Universal Service Fund

The Alaska Universal Service Fund (“AUSF”) complements the federal Universal Service Fund, but is focused on obligations to meet intrastate service obligations. We receive approximately $2.7 million annually in AUSF support. In January 2018, the RCA opened a rulemaking to repeal the AUSF effective July 31, 2019 and sought comments and reply comments. A final order issued by the RCA on October 24, 2018 stopped short of repealing the AUSF but made changes to the distribution to be effective January 1, 2019, and capped contributions at 10% of intrastate telecommunications revenues. These changes resulted in shortfalls to carriers beginning in 2019. The RCA opened a new docket to consider further AUSF reforms in 2021.

In late December 2019, the RCA opened R-19-002 to consider the Alaska Telephone Associations Petition to revise the RCA’s regulation as a result of SB 83 or the Telecommunications Modernization Act. The comment and reply comment period ended February 3, 2020. The RCA continues to consider this matter.
​
US Virgin Islands Regulation
​
Virgin Islands Public Service Commission
​
In addition to the regulations described above, our operations in the US Virgin Islands are also subject to the US Virgin Islands Public Utilities Code, pursuant to which the Virgin Islands Public Service Commission (“PSC”) regulates certain telecommunications and cable TV services that Viya provides in the US Virgin Islands. Among other things, the PSC establishes the rates and fees that we may charge local exchange residential and enterprise customers in the US Virgin Islands for certain wireline telecommunications services. The PSC is required by US Virgin Islands law to review local utility rates every five years. The PSC last adopted an order increasing the rates and fees that we may charge in June 2016, subject to certain conditions and future obligations. The PSC is overdue to conclude a new ratemaking proceeding. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries entered into a transfer of control agreement with the PSC on July 1, 2016, which imposes certain operational and reporting obligations on the Viya companies that do not, by their terms, expire. We believe that we have satisfied these requirements. Further, as a condition to Viya’s receipt of USF funds from the FCC, the PSC is required to certify on an annual basis that Viya is in compliance with certain eligible telecommunication carrier (“ETC”) obligations. We believe that we comply with all such obligations but cannot predict the outcome of future PSC proceedings relating to Viya’s ETC status.
​
Our subsidiaries provide cable TV service in the US Virgin Islands pursuant to two franchises granted by the PSC. Each franchise was renewed in July 2015 by an order issued by the PSC, but the PSC has not yet issued new franchise agreements memorializing these renewals. In August 2019, the FCC issued a decision placing some limits on the powers of local cable franchising authorities such as the PSC, including limits on their ability to impose franchise fees and to regulate non-cable services. In May 2021, a federal appeals court largely upheld that decision, reversing only on a discrete issue pertaining to the calculation of franchise fees. We cannot predict what requirements will be included by the PSC in the renewed franchise agreements or how the FCC’s past or future actions concerning cable franchising will impact the PSC’s preparation of a cable franchise renewal agreement. We understand that the renewed franchise agreements will likely contain substantially similar terms and conditions as the prior franchise agreements, including a 15-year term. We also believe that the renewed franchise agreements will exclude prior language permitting the PSC to regulate our cable rates.

​
Virgin Islands Research and Technology Park
​
Our video, internet and wireless companies in the US Virgin Islands also receive tax benefits as qualifying participants in the US Virgin Islands’ Research & Technology Park (“RTPark”) program. RTPark was chartered with the goal of promoting technology-based economic development in the territory and offering attractive economic incentives to companies that contribute to the development of the Virgin Islands through local employment and sourcing, as well as significant contributions to both the economy and the non-profit sectors of the community. As part of the program, our participating entities currently receive a 100% tax exemption applied against gross receipts, property, and excise taxes as well as a 90% exemption against income taxes and a reduction in customs duties from 6% to 1%. These benefits resulted in tax exemptions of approximately $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. In order to qualify, we are required to maintain certain capital investments over the first five years of the agreement, pay monthly management fees of 0.4% of tenant company revenue, make annual charitable contributions to the University of the Virgin Islands, purchase products and services locally when feasible and provide in-kind services to RTPark.
​
Guyana Regulation
​
Our subsidiary, Guyana Telephone & Telegraph Limited (“GTT”), in which we hold an 80% interest, is subject to regulation in Guyana under the provisions of GTT’s License from the Government of Guyana, the Guyana Public Utilities Commission Act of 2016 as amended (or “PUC Law”) and the Guyana Telecommunications Act of 2016 (or “Telecommunications Law”). The Public Utilities Commission of Guyana (or “PUC”) is an independent statutory body with the principal responsibility for regulating telecommunications rates and services in Guyana. The Ministry of Telecommunications, an agency of the Government of Guyana, has formal authority over telecommunications licensing and related issues. The Telecommunications Agency (or “TA”) advises and makes recommendations to the Minister of Telecommunications, implements policy and has principal responsibility for operating licenses and frequency authorizations.
​
Licenses. GTT provides domestic fixed (both wireline and wireless) and international voice and data services in Guyana pursuant to licenses from the Government of Guyana granting GTT the right to provide a variety of domestic fixed services (both wireline and wireless) and international voice and data services. These licenses were issued in October 2020. Pursuant to the licenses, GTT also provides mobile wireless telephone service in Guyana.
​
PUC Law and Telecommunications Law. The PUC Law and the Telecommunications Law, and related regulations adopted in October 2020, provide the general framework for the regulation of telecommunications services in Guyana. As a general matter, the PUC has authority to regulate GTT’s domestic and international telecommunications services and rates and to require GTT to supply certain technical, administrative and financial information as it may request. The PUC claims broad authority to review and amend any of GTT’s programs for development and expansion of facilities or services, although GTT has challenged the PUC’s view on the scope of its authority. For a description of recent actions of the PUC, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.
​
Regulatory Developments. On October 5, 2020, the Prime Minister of Guyana formally implemented telecommunications legislation previously passed by the Guyana Parliament in 2016 that introduces material changes to many features of Guyana’s existing telecommunications regulatory regime with the intention of creating a more competitive market. At that time, we were issued a new license to provide domestic and international voice as well as data services and mobile services in Guyana. Two of our competitors were issued service licenses as well. While we have requested details of our competitors’ licenses, such information has not been made public by the Guyana Telecommunications Agency, and we are not yet able to ascertain whether the licenses issued to our competitors permit competitors to provide services that have been subject to GTT’s exclusive rights contained in its 1990 license. Nevertheless, our competitors have in fact been providing such services, even without being licensed and without any government enforcement, for many years.
​
On October 23, 2020, the Government of Guyana also brought into effect new telecommunications regulations called for by the telecommunications legislation. The regulations include new requirements for the market as a whole, 

23



which impact our operations, administrative reporting and services. There can be no assurance that these regulations will be effectively implemented, or that they will be administered in a fair and transparent manner.
​
Bermuda Regulation
​
The Regulatory Authority of Bermuda (the “RA”) is the primary regulator of our operations in Bermuda. The relevant legislation is the Regulatory Authority Act 2011 and the Electronic Communications Act 2011. Pursuant to these statutes, the RA is responsible for regulating all electronic communications services in Bermuda, including the broadband, mobile and video services we offer. The statutory framework provides the RA powers in respect of licensing, consumer protections, ex post competition issues, and the identification and remedying of significant market power concerns.
​
On September 1, 2020, the RA completed its second market review and continued its determination we have significant market power in certain broadband and mobile services. As a consequence, we are subject to a series of ex-ante remedies that include wholesale obligations, price caps, accounting separation and reporting obligations in addition to the ex-post competition rules that generally apply. The ex-ante remedies are burdensome and require financial, operational, legal and regulatory resources be allocated to ensure compliance.
​
