Item 1. 
Business
 Overview
 Tivity Health, Inc. (the “Company”) was founded and incorporated in Delaware in 1981.  Through our three programs, SilverSneakers® senior fitness, Prime® Fitness and WholeHealth LivingTM, we are focused on advancing long-lasting health and vitality, especially in aging populations. The SilverSneakers senior fitness program is offered to members of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans.  We also offer Prime Fitness, a fitness facility access program, through commercial health plans, employers, and other sponsoring organizations.  Our national network of fitness centers delivers both SilverSneakers and Prime Fitness.  In addition, a small portion of our fitness center network is available for discounted access through our WholeHealth Living program.  Our fitness networks encompass approximately 16,000 partner locations and more than 1,000 alternative locations that provide classes outside of traditional fitness centers. Through our WholeHealth Living program, which we sell primarily to health plans, we offer a continuum of services related to complementary, alternative, and physical medicine.  Our WholeHealth Living network includes relationships with approximately 80,000 complementary, alternative, and physical medicine practitioners to serve individuals through health plans and employers who seek health services such as chiropractic care, acupuncture, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and more.
 Effective July 31, 2016, we sold our total population health services (“TPHS”) business to Sharecare, Inc. (“Sharecare”).  Results of operations for the TPHS business have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
 The Company is headquartered at 701 Cool Springs Boulevard, Franklin, Tennessee 37067.
 Pending Acquisition of Nutrisystem
 On December 9, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Nutrisystem, Inc. (“Nutrisystem”) and Sweet Acquisition, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tivity Health (“Merger Sub”). The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into Nutrisystem, with Nutrisystem surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tivity Health (the “Merger”).
 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of Nutrisystem issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares as to which appraisal rights have been properly exercised and certain other excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive (i) $38.75 in cash, without interest, and (ii) 0.2141 shares of common stock of Tivity Health, with cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of common stock of Tivity Health.  The Merger is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2019 and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Nutrisystem’s stockholders.
 In connection with the Merger Agreement, on December 9, 2018, Tivity Health entered into a debt commitment letter and corresponding fee letters (the “Debt Commitment Letter”) with Credit Suisse AG (“CS”), and Credit Suisse Loan Funding LLC (“CSLF”). On December 21, 2018, December 26, 2018, December 27, 2018, December 31, 2018 and January 4, 2019, the Debt Commitment Letter was amended to add SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. (“STRH”), SunTrust Bank (“SunTrust”), Citigroup Global Markets Inc., on behalf of itself and Citibank, N.A., Citicorp USA, Inc., Citicorp North America, Inc. and affiliates thereof, (“CGMI”), Citizens Bank, N.A. (“Citizens”), Fifth Third Bank (“Fifth Third”), Regions Bank (“Regions Bank”), Regions Capital Markets, a division of Regions Bank, (“Regions Capital Markets”), and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, together with its affiliates, including Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, (“GS,” and collectively with CS, CSLF, STRH, SunTrust, CGMI, Citizens, Fifth Third, Regions Bank, Regions Capital Markets and each of their respective affiliates, the “Commitment Parties”), as Commitment Parties under the Debt Commitment Letter and to adjust correspondingly each Commitment Party’s commitment with respect to the financing contemplated thereby.

Under the Debt Commitment Letter, among other things, CSLF, STRH, CGMI, Citizens, Fifth Third, Regions Capital Markets and GS have committed to arrange, and CS, SunTrust, CGMI, Citizens, Fifth Third, Regions Bank and GS have committed to provide, subject to terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,210,000,000 and a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $125,000,000 (collectively, the “Financing”). The Financing will be secured by a first priority security interest and lien on substantially all of the assets of Tivity Health and its wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries. 
 The Commitment Parties’ commitments pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter are subject to various conditions, including consummation of the Merger in accordance with the Merger Agreement; the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation consistent with the Debt Commitment Letter; delivery of certain audited, unaudited and pro forma financial statements; the absence of a material adverse effect on Nutrisystem after December 9, 2018; the accuracy of representations and warranties of Nutrisystem in the Merger Agreement and specified representations and warranties of Tivity Health to be set forth in the definitive loan documents; the repayment of all outstanding indebtedness and other obligations of Tivity Health and Nutrisystem under their existing credit facilities; and other customary closing conditions.

 Customer Contracts
 Our customer contracts generally have initial terms of approximately three years.  Some of our contracts allow the customer to terminate early and/or determine on an annual basis to which of their members they will offer our programs.
Business Strategy
 Our “A-B-C-D” strategy, which leverages both our traditional physical footprint and developing digital platforms, is designed to (A) add new members in our three existing networks - SilverSneakers, Prime Fitness and WholeHealth Living, (B) build engagement and participation among our current eligible members, (C) collaborate with partners to add new products and services that will leverage the value of our brand, and (D) deepen relationships with our partners and their instructors within our national network.  In addition to the A-B-C-D strategy, we are focused on supporting the ability of our health plan customers to meet the needs of their members as well as providing a valuable service to improve the health and well-being of the consumers we serve through our networks and with our programs. Additionally, throughout 2017 and 2018, we undertook a comprehensive review of “Strategy E” as a means to define opportunities for long-term growth of the Company that would leverage our current assets. Strategy E culminated in our pending acquisition of Nutrisystem that is described above under “—Pending Acquisition of Nutrisystem.” We believe the opportunity to address nutrition, physical activity, and loneliness in a holistic manner will place Tivity Health in a unique position to address a meaningful portion of healthcare costs.
 We engage and support our members based on the needs and preferences of our customers.  Within our fitness networks, we have approximately 16,000 partner locations and more than 1,000 alternative locations that provide classes outside of traditional fitness centers.  More than 15,000 of these partner locations within the national network provide access to SilverSneakers members, and more than 11,000 of these locations offer access to Prime Fitness members.
 Segment and Major Customer Information
 We have one operating and reportable segment.  During 2018, Humana, Inc. (“Humana”), United Healthcare, Inc. (“United Healthcare”), and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (“BCBSA”) each comprised more than 10%, and together comprised approximately 45%, of our revenues from continuing operations.  Our primary contract with Humana was renewed in 2018 and continues through December 31, 2022.  Our primary contract with United Healthcare continues through December 31, 2020. Our primary contract with BCBSA, which relates to our Prime Fitness business, continues through December 31, 2022. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues from continuing operations in 2018.  See Note 17 to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report relating to revenues from external customers and customer concentration.
 Competition
 The healthcare industry is highly competitive, and the manner in which services are provided is subject to continual change. Other entities, whose financial and marketing resources may exceed our resources, may choose to initiate or expand programs in competition with our offerings.

We believe we have certain advantages over our competitors such as our proprietary class programming; the brand recognition of programs such as SilverSneakers; the depth and breadth of our fitness center network relationships, which encompass approximately 16,000 partner locations; and the trusting connections with our members developed over more than 25 years that have generated nearly 700 million member visits to partner locations since 2001.  However, we cannot assure you that we can compete effectively with other entities who provide similar services.
 Industry Integration and Consolidation
 Consolidation remains an important factor in all aspects of the healthcare industry.  While we believe the size of our membership base provides us with the economies of scale to compete even in a consolidating market, we cannot assure you that we can effectively compete with companies formed as a result of industry consolidation or that we can retain existing customers if they are acquired by other entities that already have or contract for programs similar to ours or are not interested in our programs.
Governmental Regulation
 Governmental regulation impacts us in a number of ways in addition to those regulatory risks presented under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” below.
 Health Reform
 In recent years, Congress and certain state governments have passed a large number of laws and regulations intended to result in major changes within the healthcare system. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”), the most prominent of these efforts, changes how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed through, among other things, expanded health insurance coverage, reduced growth in Medicare program spending and the establishment of programs that tie reimbursement to care quality and value. 
 The ACA, as currently structured, contains provisions that affect our customers, including commercial health plans and Medicare Advantage programs. The ACA has decreased the number of uninsured individuals and expanded coverage through the expansion of public programs and private sector health insurance. However, the ACA also may increase costs and/or reduce the revenues of our customers or prospective customers. For example, the ACA prohibits commercial health plans from using gender, health status, family history, or occupation to set premium rates, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions, and bans annual benefit limits. In addition, the ACA established uniform minimum medical loss ratios (“MLRs”) for health plans, requiring a minimum percentage of health coverage premium revenue to be spent on healthcare medical costs and quality improvement expenses. The ACA also reduced premium payments to Medicare Advantage plans such that the managed care per capita payments paid by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to Medicare Advantage plans are now, on average, approximately equal to those for traditional Medicare. While the ACA provides for bonuses to Medicare Advantage plans that achieve service benchmarks and quality ratings, overall payments to Medicare Advantage plans have been significantly reduced under the ACA.
 There is substantial uncertainty regarding the ongoing effects of the ACA because the presidential administration and Congress have made significant changes to the ACA, its implementation and its interpretation. The President has signed an executive order that directs agencies to minimize “economic and regulatory burdens” of the ACA. Final rules issued in 2018 expand the availability of association health plans and allow the sale of short-term, limited-duration health plans, neither of which are required to cover all of the essential benefits mandated by the ACA.  Effective January 2019, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the ACA’s individual mandate. In December 2018, a federal court in Texas ruled that the entire ACA was unconstitutional because the penalty associated with the individual mandate was eliminated.  However, the law remains in effect pending appeal. It is difficult to predict whether, when or how the ACA will be further changed, what alternative provisions, if any, will be enacted, the timing of implementation of any alternative provisions, the impact of alternative provisions on providers and other healthcare industry participants, and the ultimate outcome and impact of court challenges. The healthcare industry remains subject to ongoing health reform initiatives. For example, beginning in 2020, the Creating High-quality Results and Outcomes Necessary to Improve Chronic (CHRONIC) Care Act of 2018  (“Chronic Care Act”) will allow Medicare Advantage plans to cover supplemental benefits that are not primarily health-related, but that have the reasonable expectation of improving or maintaining health.  Members of Congress have also proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, including single-payor proposals.

Other Laws
 While many of the governmental and regulatory requirements affecting healthcare delivery generally do not directly apply to us, our customers must comply with a variety of regulations including those governing Medicare Advantage plans and their marketing and the licensing and reimbursement requirements of federal, state and local agencies. Certain of our services, including health service utilization management and certain claims payment functions, require licensure by state government agencies. We are subject to a variety of legal requirements in order to obtain and maintain such licenses.
 Federal privacy regulations issued pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) extensively restrict the use and disclosure of individually-identifiable health information by health plans, most healthcare providers, and certain other entities (collectively, “covered entities”). Federal security regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA require covered entities to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic individually-identifiable health information. Because we handle individually-identifiable health information on behalf of covered entities, we are considered a "business associate" and are required to comply with most aspects of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations.
 Violations of HIPAA and its implementing regulations may result in criminal penalties and in substantial civil penalties for each violation. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. In addition, we may be contractually or directly obligated to comply with any applicable state laws or regulations related to the confidentiality and security of confidential personal information. In the event of a data breach involving individually-identifiable health information, we are subject to contractual obligations and state and federal requirements that require us to notify our customers. These requirements may also require us or our customers to notify affected individuals, regulatory agencies, and the media of the data breach. Non-permitted uses and disclosures of unsecured individually identifiable health information are presumed to be breaches for which notice is required, unless it can be demonstrated that there is a low probability the information has been compromised.
 Federal law contains various prohibitions related to false statements and false claims, some of which apply to private payors as well as federal programs. Our contracts with Medicare Advantage plans may subject us to a number of obligations, including billing and reimbursement requirements, prohibitions on fraudulent and abusive conduct and related training and screening obligations. Actions may be brought under the federal False Claims Act by the government as well as by private individuals, known as “whistleblowers,” who are permitted to share in any settlement or judgment. Liability under the federal False Claims Act arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal False Claims Act defines the term “knowingly” broadly. There are many other potential bases for liability under the federal False Claims Act, including knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and the knowing failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment. The submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of certain “fraud and abuse” provisions of the Social Security Act, including the anti-kickback provisions, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the federal False Claims Act. In some cases, whistleblowers, the federal government, and some courts have taken the position that entities that allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the federal self-referral prohibition commonly known as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the federal False Claims Act.
 From time to time, participants in the healthcare industry, including our company and our customers, may be subject to actions under the federal False Claims Act or other fraud and abuse laws, including similar state statutes, and it is not possible to predict the impact of such actions. Violations of applicable laws may result in significant civil and criminal penalties. For example, violations of the federal False Claims Act may result in penalties of three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus substantial mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.
 Because of the international operations previously conducted as part of our TPHS business that we sold to Sharecare in July 2016, we were subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries in which we provided services prior to the sale. The FCPA and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage. Failure to comply with the FCPA and similar legislation prior to the sale of our TPHS business could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines and penalties.
