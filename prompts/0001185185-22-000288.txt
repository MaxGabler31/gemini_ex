Item 1.  Business



In this report, “JAKKS,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to JAKKS Pacific, Inc., its subsidiaries and our majority-owned joint venture.



Company Overview



We are a leading multi-line, multi-brand toy company that designs, produces, markets, sells and distributes toys and related products, consumables and related products, electronics and related products, kids indoor and outdoor furniture, and other consumer products. We focus our business on acquiring or licensing well-recognized intellectual property (“IP”), trademarks and/or brand names, most with long product histories (“evergreen brands”). We seek to acquire/license these evergreen brands because we believe they are less subject to market fads or trends. We also develop proprietary products marketed under our own trademarks and brand names, and have historically acquired complementary businesses to further grow our portfolio. For accounting purposes, our products have been divided into two segments: (i) Toys/Consumer Products and (ii) Costumes. Segment information with respect to revenues, assets and profits or losses attributable to each segment is contained in Note 3 to the audited consolidated financial statements contained below in Item 8. Our products include:

● | Action figures and accessories, including licensed characters based on the Nintendo®, Sonic the Hedgehog® and Apex Legends® franchises and our own proprietary brands including Creepy Crawlers™; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Toy vehicles, including Xtreme Power Dozer®, Xtreme Power Dump Truck®, XPV®, Road Champs®, Fly Wheels® and MXS® toy vehicles and accessories; 
● | Dolls and accessories, including small dolls, large dolls, fashion dolls and baby dolls based on licenses, including Disney Encanto™, Disney ILY 4EVER™, Disney Frozen®, Disney Princess® and Minnie Mouse®, and infant and pre-school toys based on TV shows like Gigantosaurus® and PBS’s Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood®; 
● | Private label products developed exclusively for certain retail customers in various product categories; 
● | Foot-to-floor ride-on products, including those based on Fisher-Price®, Nickelodeon®, and Hasbro®/Entertainment One® licenses and inflatable environments, tents and wagons; 
● | Role play, dress-up, pretend play and novelty products for boys and girls based on well-known brands and entertainment properties such as Disney Frozen®, Black & Decker®, Disney Princess®, and Disney Encanto™, as well as those based on our own proprietary brands; 
● | Indoor and outdoor kids’ furniture, activity trays and tables and room décor; kiddie pools, seasonal and outdoor products, including those based on Disney® characters, Nickelodeon®, Hasbro®/Entertainment One® licenses; 
● | Halloween and everyday costumes for all ages based on licensed and proprietary non-licensed brands, including Super Mario Bros.®, Microsoft’s Halo®, LEGO® Movie, Disney-Pixar Toy Story®, Harry Potter®, Jurassic World®, Sesame Street®, Power Rangers®¸ Hasbro® brands and Disney Frozen®, Disney Princess® and related Halloween accessories; and
● | Outdoor activity toys including Redo Skateboard Co.® and Junior sports toys including Skyball® hyper-charged balls, sport sets and Wave Hoops® toy hoops marketed under our Maui® brand.

We continually review the marketplace to identify and evaluate popular and evergreen brands and product categories that we believe have the potential for growth. We endeavor to generate growth within these lines by:




● | creating innovative products under our established licenses and brand names;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adding new items to the branded product lines that we expect will enjoy greater popularity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | infusing innovation and technology when appropriate to make products more appealing to today’s kids; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanding our international product offering either sold directly to retailers or via third party distributors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Business Strategy



In addition to developing our own proprietary brands, properties and marks, licensing popular IP enables us to use these high-profile marks at a lower cost than we would incur if we purchased these marks or funded the development of comparable marks on our own. Beyond the investment profile, we have an appreciation of the challenges and expertise required to break through the noise in a world filled with high-budget, content-centric consumer choices either based on well-known pre-existing IP or the even higher hurdle to launch new IP in the aforementioned marketplace. By licensing IP and trademarks from world-class brand owners and content creators, we have access to a far greater range of marks than would be available for purchase. It also helps to credibly assure licensors that we will prioritize their brands, properties and IP rather than explicitly competing with them with a broad-range of self-developed content-led offerings. We also license technology developed by unaffiliated inventors and product developers to enhance the design, innovation and functionality of our products.



We sell our products through our in-house sales staff and independent sales representatives to toy and mass-market retail chain stores, department stores, office supply stores, drug and grocery store chains, club stores, value-oriented dollar stores, toy specialty stores and wholesalers. Our two largest customers are Walmart® and Target®, which accounted for 26.9% and 28.4%, respectively, of our net sales in 2021. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in 2021.



Our Growth Strategy



Key elements of our growth strategy include:



●Expand Core Product Lines. We manage our existing and new brands through strategic product development initiatives, including introducing new products, modifying existing products and extending existing product lines to maximize their longevity. Our marketing teams and product designers strive to develop new products or product lines to offer added technological, aesthetic and functional improvements to our extensive portfolio.
●Enter New Product Categories. We use our extensive experience in the toy and other consumer product industries to evaluate products and licenses in new product categories and to develop additional product lines. We began marketing licensed classic video games for simple plug-in use with television sets and expanded into several related categories by infusing additional technologies such as motion gaming and through the licensing of this category from our current licensors, such as Disney. We recently entered the skateboard space at a retailer’s request and are now expanding into related protective gear and accessories.
●Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We have supplemented our internal growth with selected strategic acquisitions. Most of the product lines we market today were originally acquired via acquisition over the past 20+ years. In 2021, we evaluated several potential acquisitions although none resonated to the point of reaching an agreement.



●Acquire Additional Character and Product Licenses. We have acquired the rights to use many familiar brand and character names and logos from third parties that we use with our primary trademarks and brands. Currently, among others, we have license agreements with Nickelodeon®, Disney®, Pixar®, Marvel®, NBC Universal®, Microsoft©, Sega®, Sony®, Netflix® and WarnerMedia.®, as well as with the licensors of many other popular characters. We also license IP from other toy companies for categories in which they do not offer products found within our Core Product Lines. We intend to continue to pursue new licenses from these media & entertainment companies along with other licensors. We also intend to continue to purchase additional inventions and product concepts through our existing network of inventors and product developers.

●Expand International Sales. We believe that non-US markets: Europe, Australia, Canada, Latin America and Asia, offer us significant growth opportunities. In 2021, our sales generated outside the United States were approximately $108.9 million, or 17.5% of total net sales. In 2020, we migrated from a distributor model to selling direct in Spain, Italy, France and Mexico. Third-party distributors remain a core component of our international business, and we are constantly assessing how to expand our mutual businesses. Although the COVID-19 pandemic had a significantly negative impact on our international business, we remain focused on international being a source of revenue growth. We currently utilize one warehouse in the United Kingdom and another in the Netherlands to support sales expansion in that region.
●Capitalize On Our Operating Efficiencies. We believe that our current infrastructure and operating model can accommodate growth without a proportionate increase in our operating and administrative expenses, thereby increasing our operating margins.



The execution of our growth strategy, however, is subject to several risks and uncertainties and we cannot assure you that we will continue to experience growth in, or maintain our present level of net sales (see “Risk Factors,” in Item 1A). For example, our growth strategy will place additional demands upon our management, operational capacity and financial resources and systems. The increased demand upon management may necessitate our recruitment and retention of additional qualified management personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be able to recruit and retain qualified personnel or expand and manage our operations effectively and profitably. To effectively manage future growth, we must continue to expand our operational, financial and management information systems and to train, motivate and manage our work force. While we believe that our operational, financial and management information systems will be adequate to support our future growth, no assurance can be given they will be adequate without significant investment in our infrastructure. Failure to expand our operational, financial and management information systems or to train, motivate, manage and retain employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Moreover, implementation of our growth strategy is subject to risks beyond our control, including: competition; market acceptance of new products; changes in economic conditions; changes in the media & entertainment landscape disrupting the traditional model of capturing consumer attention for new entertainment-led offerings; our ability to obtain or renew licenses on commercially reasonable terms; and our ability to finance increased levels of accounts receivable and inventory necessary to support our sales growth, if any.



Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we can identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable acquisition terms, and our failure to do so may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to sustain growth.



Finally, our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks, each of which could adversely affect our operating results, including difficulties in integrating acquired businesses or product lines, assimilating new facilities and personnel and harmonizing diverse business strategies and methods of operation; diversion of management attention from operation of our existing business; loss of key personnel from acquired companies; and failure of an acquired business to achieve targeted financial results.



Industry Overview



According to Toy Association, Inc., the leading toy industry trade group, the United States is the world’s largest toy market, followed by China, Japan and Western Europe. Total retail sales of toys, excluding video games, in the United States, were approximately $28.6 billion in 2021. We believe the two largest United States toy companies, Hasbro® and Mattel®, collectively hold a dominant share of the U.S. toy market. In addition, hundreds of smaller companies compete in the design and development of new toys, the procurement of character and product licenses, and the improvement, expansion and re-introduction of previously established products and product lines.



Over the years, the toy industry has experienced substantial consolidation among both toy companies and toy retailers. We believe that the ongoing consolidation of toy companies provides us with increased growth opportunities due to retailers’ desire to not be entirely dependent upon a few dominant toy companies. Retailer concentration also enables us to ship products, manage account relationships and track point of sale information more effectively and efficiently.



Products



We focus our business on acquiring or licensing well-recognized properties, trademarks and/or brand names, and we seek to acquire evergreen brands which are less subject to market fads or trends. Generally, our license agreements for products and concepts call for royalties ranging from 1% to 23% of net sales, and some may require minimum royalty guarantees and up-front or advanced royalty payments. Our principal products are highlighted above in our Company Overview.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution



We sell all of our products through our own in-house sales staff and independent sales representatives to toy and mass-market retail chain stores, department stores, office supply stores, drug and grocery store chains, club stores, dollar stores, toy specialty stores and wholesalers. In 2021, our two largest customers, Walmart and Target, accounted for 26.9% and 28.4%, respectively, of our net sales. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in 2021. In 2020, our two largest customers, Walmart and Target, accounted for 29.1% and 25.7%, respectively, of our net sales. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in 2020. We generally sell products to our customers on open account with payment terms typically varying from 30 to 90 days or, in some cases, pursuant to letters of credit. For sales outside of the United States, we may also purchase credit insurance to mitigate the risk, if any, of non-payment. From time to time, we allow our customers credits against future purchases from us in order to facilitate their retail markdown and sales of slow-moving inventory. We also sell our products through e-commerce sites, including Walmart.com®, Target.com™ and Amazon.com®.



We contract the manufacture of most of our products to unaffiliated manufacturers located in The People’s Republic of China (“China”). We sell the finished products to our customers, many of whom take title to the goods in Hong Kong or China. These methods allow us to reduce certain operating costs and working capital requirements. We also contract the manufacture of certain products from Hong Kong Meisheng Cultural Company Limited (“Meisheng”), which involved payment to Meisheng of approximately $77.7 million and $64.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, Meisheng owns 5.5% of our outstanding common stock, and Zhao Xiaoqiang, one of our directors, is executive director of Meisheng. A portion of our sales originate in the United States, so we hold certain inventory in a US warehouse and fulfillment facility. To date, a majority of all of our sales has been to customers based in the United States. We intend to continue expanding distribution of our products into foreign territories and, accordingly, we have:




● | entered into a joint venture in China;
--+---------------------------------------


● | engaged representatives to oversee sales in certain foreign territories;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | engaged distributors in certain foreign territories;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | established direct relationships with retailers in certain foreign territories;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | opened sales offices in Canada, Europe and Mexico; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | opened distribution centers in the UK and Europe.
--+--------------------------------------------------




Outside of the United States, we currently sell our products primarily in Europe, Australia, Canada, Latin America and Asia. Sales of our products abroad accounted for approximately $108.9 million, or 17.5% of our net sales in 2021 and approximately $94.7 million, or 18.3% of our net sales in 2020. We believe that foreign markets present an attractive opportunity, and we plan to intensify our marketing efforts and further expand our distribution channels abroad.



We establish reserves for allowances provided to our customers, including discounts, pricing concessions, promotional allowances and allowances for anticipated breakage or defective product, at the time of shipment. The reserves are determined as a percentage of sales based upon either historical experience or upon estimates or programs agreed upon with our customers.



We obtain, directly, or through our sales representatives, orders for our products from our customers and arrange for the manufacture of these products as discussed below. Cancellations generally are made in writing, and we take appropriate steps to notify our manufacturers of these cancellations. We may incur costs or other losses as a result of cancellations.



We maintain a full-time sales and marketing staff, many of whom make on-site visits to customers for the purpose of showing products and soliciting orders for products. We also retain a number of independent sales representatives to sell and promote our products, both domestically and internationally. Together with retailers, we occasionally test the consumer acceptance of new products in selected markets before committing resources to large-scale production.

We publicize and advertise our products online and on mobile, in trade and consumer magazines and other publications, market our products at international, national and regional toy and other specialty trade shows, conventions and exhibitions and carry on cooperative advertising programs with toy and mass market retailers and other customers which include the use of print, online, mobile and television ads and via in-store displays. We also produce and broadcast television commercials for several of our product lines, if we expect that the resulting increase in our net sales will justify the relatively high cost of television/media advertising.



Product Development



Each of our product lines has an in-house manager responsible for product development. The in-house manager identifies and evaluates inventor products and concepts and other opportunities to enhance or expand existing product lines or to enter new product categories. In addition, we create proprietary products to fully exploit our concept and character licenses. Although we have the capability to create and develop products from inception to production, we also use third-parties to provide a portion of the sculpting, sample making, illustration and package design required for our products in order to accommodate our increasing product innovations and introductions as well as accelerate our speed-to-market. Typically, the development process takes from nine to eighteen months from concept to production and shipment to our customers, but given our Company’s size and structure, we have demonstrated the ability to shrink that down to three to nine months successfully when the opportunity requires.



We employ a staff of designers for all of our product lines. We occasionally acquire other product concepts from unaffiliated third parties. If we accept and develop a third-party’s concept for new toys, we generally pay a royalty on the sale of the toys developed from this concept, and may, on an individual basis, guarantee a minimum royalty. Royalties payable to inventors and developers generally range from 1% to 4% of the wholesale sales price for each unit of a product sold by us. We believe that utilizing experienced third-party inventors gives us access to a wide range of development talent. We currently work with numerous toy inventors and designers for the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products.



Safety testing of our products is done at the manufacturers’ facilities by quality control personnel employed by us or by independent third-party contractors engaged by us. Safety testing is designed to meet or exceed regulations imposed by federal and state, as well as applicable international governmental authorities, our retail partners, licensors and the Toy Association. We also closely monitor quality assurance procedures for our products for safety purposes. In addition, independent laboratories engaged by some of our larger customers and licensors test certain of our products.



Manufacturing and Supplies



Most of our products are currently produced by overseas third-party manufacturers, which we choose on the basis of quality, flexibility, reliability and price. Consistent with industry practice, the use of third-party manufacturers enables us to avoid incurring fixed manufacturing costs, while maximizing flexibility, capacity and the latest production technology. Substantially all of the manufacturing services performed overseas for us are paid for on open account with the manufacturers. To date, we have not experienced any material delays in the delivery of our products from our manufacturers; however, delivery schedules are subject to various factors beyond our control, and any delays in the future could adversely affect our sales. The COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, created some short-term delays as manufacturing capacity both dropped during the peak of the China outbreak and then again was stretched when consumer demand for different categories of products spiked as a result of the unprecedented level of households operating under confined-to-home/social distancing guidelines. The lingering impact of the pandemic has created volatility in costs associated with the sourcing and importation of product, in particular due to changes in factor inputs (labor, oil) and market demand for services (transport). In addition, our third-party manufacturers have seen increases in foreign exchange rate exposure during this time. Currently, we have ongoing relationships with over seventy different manufacturers. We believe that alternative sources of supply are available to us although we cannot be assured that we can obtain adequate supplies of manufactured products on short notice. We may also incur costs or other losses as a result of not placing orders consistent with our forecasts for product to be manufactured by our suppliers or manufacturers for a variety of reasons including customer order cancellations or a decline in demand.



Although we do not conduct the day-to-day manufacturing of our products, we are extensively involved in the design of product prototypes and production tools, dies and molds for our products and we seek to ensure quality control by actively reviewing the production process and testing the products produced by our manufacturers. We employ quality control inspectors who rotate among our manufacturers’ factories to monitor the production of substantially all of our products.



The principal raw materials used in the production and sale of our toy products are plastics, zinc alloy, plush, printed fabrics, paper products and electronic components, all of which are currently available at reasonable prices from a variety of sources. Although we do not directly manufacture our products, we own the majority of the tools, dies and molds used in the manufacturing process, and these are transferable among manufacturers if we choose to employ alternative manufacturers. Tools, dies and molds represent a substantial portion of our property and equipment with a net book value of $11.6 million and $10.8 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Substantially all of these assets are located in China.



   10

 



Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses



We routinely pursue protection of our products through some form or combination of intellectual property right(s). We file patent applications where appropriate to protect our innovations arising from new development and design, and as a result, possess a portfolio of issued patents in the U.S. and abroad. Most of our products are produced and sold under trademarks owned by or licensed to us. In recent years, our rate of filing new trademark applications has increased. We also register certain aspects of some of our products with the U.S. Copyright Office. In the same vein, we enforce our rights against infringers because we recognize our intellectual property rights are significant assets that contribute to our success. Accordingly, while we believe we are sufficiently protected and the duration of our rights are aligned with the lifecycle of our products, the loss of some of these rights could have an adverse effect on our financial growth expectations and business operations.
Competition



Competition in the toy industry is intense. Globally, certain of our competitors have greater financial resources, larger sales and marketing and product development departments, stronger name recognition, wholly-owned brands and properties with high consumer awareness and appeal, longer operating histories and benefit from greater economies of scale. These factors, among others, may enable our competitors to market their products at lower prices or on terms more advantageous to customers than those we could offer for our competitive products. Competition often extends to the procurement of entertainment and product licenses, as well as the marketing and distribution of products and the obtaining of adequate shelf space. Competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In many of our product lines we compete directly against one or both of the toy industry’s two dominant companies, Mattel® and Hasbro®. In addition, we compete in our Halloween costume lines with Rubies II. We also compete with numerous smaller domestic and foreign toy manufacturers, importers and marketers in each of our product categories.
Seasonality and Backlog



In 2021, 68.4% of our net sales were made in the third and fourth quarters. Generally, the first quarter is the period of lowest shipments and sales in our business and in the toy industry and therefore it is also the least profitable quarter due to various fixed costs. Seasonality factors cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. However, our seasonal products are primarily sold in the spring and summer seasons. Our results of operations may also fluctuate as a result of factors such as the timing of new products (and related expenses) introduced by us or our competitors, the theatrical/entertainment-led releases of licensed brands, the advertising activities of our competitors, delivery schedules set by our customers and the emergence of new market entrants. We believe, however, that the low retail price of most of our products may be less subject to seasonal fluctuations than higher-priced toy products.



We ship products in accordance with delivery schedules specified by our customers, who generally request delivery of products within three to six months of the date of their orders for orders shipped FOB China or Hong Kong and within three days for orders shipped domestically (i.e., from one of our warehouses). Because customer orders may be canceled at any time, often without penalty, our backlog may not accurately indicate sales for any future period.



In 2021, a number of factors ultimately attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic disruption created significant bottlenecks and supply-demand imbalances in exporting product out of Asia into the United States and Europe. These factors increased the cost of ocean freight and the cost of trucking while incurring higher expenses and penalties from product being stuck at the port awaiting inbound trucking pickup. The unpredictability of delivery times further resulted in higher warehouse handling costs as container arrival timelines proved less predictable sometimes requiring overtime labor and expansion of the short-term labor pool to cope with above-average arriving volumes. Finally, the longer delivery time resulted in a slower cash conversion cycle for us as the net impact was a longer holding period for finished goods inventory between manufacture and sale to customer.



Government and Industry Regulation



Our products are subject to the provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act (“CPSA”), the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (“FHSA”), the Flammable Fabrics Act (“FFA”) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and various other regulations in the European Union and other jurisdictions. The CPSA and the FHSA enable the Consumer Products Safety Commission (“CPSC”) to exclude from the market consumer products that fail to comply with applicable product safety regulations or otherwise create a substantial risk of injury, and articles that contain excessive amounts of a banned hazardous substance. The FFA enables the CPSC to regulate and enforce flammability standards for fabrics used in consumer products. The CPSC may also require the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles. Similar laws exist in some states and cities and in various international markets. We maintain a quality control program designed to ensure compliance with all applicable laws.

Human Capital



Our success comes from recruiting, retaining and motivating talented individuals around the world. JAKKS Pacific, Inc. continuously strives to create a safe, healthy, productive and harmonious work environment.



As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 583 employees (including temporary and seasonal employees) working in over 8 countries worldwide to create innovative products and experiences that inspire, entertain, and develop children through play, with approximately 232 employees (40% of the total workforce) located outside the U.S.



The remaining workforce focuses on design, development, marketing, sales, finance, and other aspects of our business.



Employee Engagement



One of our main focuses is employee retention. We empower our management to identify top performers and mentor them. We encourage all employees to take advantage of in-house and external training programs and continuing education. Our Human Resources department has an open-door policy that encourages employees to seek career advancement advice. We utilize an “Employee Development Plan” which outlines both short-term and long-term career plans. Holding various events and workshops throughout the year, employees are encouraged to voice any concerns and/or to bring forth their ideas and suggestions. We have communicated to staff that we will move to a work-from-home Friday operating model for most employees when we resume in-office activities.
Diversity and Inclusion



We are committed to fostering, cultivating and preserving a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion.



The collective sum of the individual differences, life experiences, knowledge, inventiveness, innovation, self-expression, unique capabilities and talent that our employees invest in their work represents a significant part of the culture.



We embrace and encourage employees’ differences in age, color, ability, ethnicity, family or marital status, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, physical and mental ability, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, veteran status, and other characteristics.



Our diversity initiatives are applicable—but not limited—to practices and policies on recruitment and selection; compensation and benefits; professional development and training; and promotions and transfers.



Training and Development



We take pride in offering the opportunity for employees to continuously learn and to grow their careers. Annually, employees are offered various types of training and the opportunity to continue their education. This includes both online and instructor-led training covering a variety of topics including: career-related, federally- and locally-mandated, JAKKS Pacific, Inc. Company policy and legal, financial services and health/wellness-related. Nearly all employees take advantage of these learning opportunities. In 2021, all courses and trainings were held online with excellent participation.
Health and Safety



We are committed to providing a safe, healthy and productive working environment for all of our employees globally.



In 2021 with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our number one priority was the health and safety of all of our employees, worldwide. The immediate and continuous response was to provide a remote work environment for employees (when available), implement enhanced protocols to provide a safe and sanitary working environment and offer on-site COVID-19 testing at no cost to employees and their dependents.
Environmental Issues



We may be subject to legal and financial obligations under environmental, health and safety laws in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we operate. We are not currently aware of any material environmental liabilities associated with any of our operations.
