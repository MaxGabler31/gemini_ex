ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Our Business
We are global innovation leaders in accessories and technologies that empower mobile lifestyles, with a commitment to enhance every aspect of performance, productivity, and durability in mobile devices with our creative product solutions. Our business was initially created from the concept of using a clear film originally designed to protect the blades of military helicopters in harsh desert conditions to protect consumers’ mobile devices. Since then, we have endeavored to continuously innovate and improve our products to meet changing customer needs, and now offer a wide array of innovative products in several product categories to protect, enhance, and create a better mobile device experience. Mobile devices are essential to modern living and our mission is to enable the optimal mobile lifestyle through the use of our products.
In addition to our home-grown brands, we have created a platform to combine category-creating and innovative brands that we have acquired to our existing house of brands to address specific consumer needs and empower a mobile lifestyle. We have an award-winning product portfolio that includes screen protection, power cases, power management, wireless charging, audio, mobile keyboards, protective cases, and other mobile accessories sold under the ZAGG®, InvisibleShield®, mophie®, IFROGZ®, BRAVEN®, Gear4®, and HALO® brands.
We maintain our corporate headquarters at 910 West Legacy Center Way, Suite 500, Midvale, Utah, 84047. Our telephone number is 801-263-0699 and our website addresses are www.ZAGG.com, www.mophie.com, www.Gear4.com, and www.HALO.com. The URLs are included here as inactive textual references. Information contained on, or accessible through, our websites is not a part of, and is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We have established four corporate objectives and seven core values to act as a foundation for and guide our Company daily:

Corporate Objectives | Core Values 
The Preferred Brand | Integrity 
Creative Product Solutions | Ownership 
Targeted Global Distribution | Care for People 
Operational Excellence | Passion 
 | Continuous Improvement
 | Performance 
 | Sense of Urgency 

The corporate objectives are intended to align our functional teams’ goals and execution. Every one of our employees is trained to understand his or her role in executing these objectives. Each core value acts as a key component in working toward our corporate objectives of providing creative product solutions, executing targeted global distribution, achieving operational excellence, and being the preferred brand for our customers.
Our Products
Our innovative products are included in the following general categories:
•Protection (screen protection and protective cases)
•Power (power stations, wireless chargers, and power cases)
•Audio (earbuds, headphones, and speakers)
•Productivity and Other (keyboards and other mobile accessory products)
These products are broken down by brand as follows:
InvisibleShield Products
InvisibleShield products, including InvisibleShield Film, InvisibleShield Glass, and the InvisibleShield On Demand® (“ISOD”) solution, are designed to provide premium, lifetime protection for mobile device screens against shattering or scratching through military-grade solutions. Our products are designed to provide peace of mind by enabling consumers to enjoy their mobile devices without the inconvenience of a shattered, cracked, or scratched screen. Our protective InvisibleShield Film and InvisibleShield Glass products offer consumers a wide array of protection types and features, all with a limited lifetime warranty.
InvisibleShield Film was originally developed to protect the leading edge of rotary blades on military helicopters. Through constant innovation, we continue to formulate new film that is designed to offer the highest standards in self-healing scratch and impact protection. We also continue to drive innovation around simplifying the customer application experience like we have done with our EZ Apply® tabs, which are designed to help users align and apply InvisibleShield products. Additionally, we provide custom-fit screen protection for thousands of device types through our automated ISOD solution. With our ISOD solution, retailers can supply consumers with screen protection for nearly any device model, all without having to hold excess inventory.
InvisibleShield Glass is designed to provide premium screen protection and clarity, along with a superior feel and compatible touch sensitivity. During 2018, we launched InvisibleShield Glass + VisionGuard™ for Apple® iPhone® smartphones, Apple iPad® tablets and Google® Pixel® smartphones, which features protective EyeSafe® technology that filters out portions of the harmful high-energy visible blue light spectrum emanating from device screens, while maintaining the superior color performance of the device display. In addition, we introduced InvisibleShield Ultra Clear™ in 2019 for selected smartphone models that offers maximum clarity and shatter protection with an advanced glass-like surface that feels as smooth as the smartphone's original screen.
We have the leading market share in screen protection in the United States (“U.S.”), and have maintained that leading position by consistently delivering innovative InvisibleShield products to the market. We continue to innovate and expand our screen protection products to meet the evolution of new technological products and consumer needs in the market.
Gear4 Products
In late November 2018, we acquired Gear4 HK Limited (“Gear4”), one of the top selling smartphone case brands in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), to strengthen our protective case product line. Gear4 protective cases exclusively feature D3O® technology, which is designed to provide the thinnest and most advanced impact and shock absorption - the same material used in professional sports, industrial, and military equipment applications. D3O materials, in its raw state, can flow freely when moved slowly, but on shock, lock together to absorb and disperse energy before instantly returning to their flexible state. In early 2019, we released the Chelsea product line, which is a new-to-market concept that allows consumers to express their style by swapping the design of their case with ease. With this new Gear4 innovation, consumers can easily insert the design between a Gear4 clear case and the device for the perfect combination of style and impact protection.
With D3O technology and our expansive global distribution channels, we believe Gear4 cases will offer the best mobile device protection experience for our customers and provide us with meaningful growth opportunities in our protective case protection product line.
mophie Products
mophie is a leading battery case, mobile power, and wireless charging brand with award-winning products designed to liberate mobile users from the limitations of mobile devices by providing more time to rock, talk, watch, game, surf, save, and send. Notably, the original juice pack® was designed to provide device-specific protection as well as additional battery power to many of the most popular mobile phones. mophie products are recognized for style and engineered for performance, providing a seamless integration of hardware, software, and design. Currently, the mophie ecosystem of mobile accessories is designed to provide both power and protection for virtually any mobile device. With groundbreaking battery cases, wireless charging, universal batteries, cables, adapters, and docks, mophie products represent innovation at the forefront of design and development.
mophie's innovative universal wireless charging pads are designed to provide an optimized charging experience with the latest Qi wireless charging technology for universal compatibility. During 2018, new charge stream powerstation®  products were launched to ensure customers have access to easy, fast and convenient wireless charging anywhere and anytime for Apple, Samsung®, and other Qi-enabled mobile devices. In early 2019, we launched the new juice pack access battery cases to provide advanced impact protection for the Apple's latest smartphones that features extra battery life, wireless charging and full access to the iPhone Lightning port.
We continue to innovate and expand our power case and power management product lines under the mophie brand to provide new product experiences that are pleasing to consumers.
HALO Products
In January 2019, we acquired Halo2Cloud, LLC (“HALO”), a leading direct-to-consumer accessories company with an extensive intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio. HALO designs, develops, and markets innovative technology products to make consumers' lives easier through empowering mobile lifestyles. The HALO brand is committed to offering products at the nexus of fashion and function to power consumers' lives. HALO has a rich history in innovation that includes wireless charging, car and wall chargers, portable power, and power wallets, with a long-standing reputation as one of the top selling electronics brands on QVC®, a global leader in televised home shopping and e-commerce. We believe that the acquisition of HALO will enable us to offer, at scale, the most innovative mobile lifestyle solutions available on the market today and be better positioned to address the evolving needs of consumers around the world.
IFROGZ Products
IFROGZ products are strategically designed and positioned to bring personal audio to the value space by providing a product assortment that represents outstanding performance, active lifestyles, and dual-purpose designs that are on trend with consumers’ needs. IFROGZ refines today’s newest audio technology to deliver the features consumers want, while eliminating those that needlessly increase costs, so that everyone can participate in our increasingly mobile world.
IFROGZ EarPollution® product line of earbuds and headphones specifically target a younger demographic while still appealing to a wide spectrum of consumers. During 2018, we introduced the Sound Hub™ wireless earbud family. With this new line of wireless audio, customers have more customized options for their wireless audio as its Bluetooth® receiver turns any device with a 3.5mm jack, such as headphones, earbuds, and speakers, into a wireless audio device.
We continue to innovate and expand our headphone and earbud product lines under the IFROGZ brand to include offerings for all ages under both the EarPollution and Sound Hub product lines.
BRAVEN Products
In July 2018, we acquired BRAVEN Audio (“BRAVEN”) to expand our audio product profile. As creators and innovators of the rugged Bluetooth audio category, BRAVEN combines unparalleled design with cutting-edge technology to produce premium Bluetooth audio solutions for the outdoor adventurer and modern audio enthusiast. BRAVEN's intelligently designed products include robust craftsmanship and world-class engineering to create a thrilling audio experience. In 2019, we introduced the BRV™-360 and the BRV-105 Bluetooth speakers. The BRV-360 speaker was designed to withstand rain, waterfalls, or dunks in lakes, Combine BRV-360's waterproof IP67 rating with 12 hours of playtime, the ability to charge a smartphone 2X’s, and a form factor that fits easily in that handy water bottle holder on your adventure pack, The BRV-105 speaker is our most versatile and affordable Bluetooth speaker in the BRAVEN line. BRV-105 is a palm-sized portable speaker that blasts with full body sound. This lightweight, durable and waterproof speaker has an 8 hour playtime and can be attached to sport accessories, belt loops, handle bars and more using its versatile elastic strap. While on the go, the internal speakerphone enables hands-free phone calls with noise-canceling technology to eliminate any unwanted background sound.
We anticipate that the combination of high audio quality, ease of use, and superior features will enable us to develop the BRAVEN brand into one of the fastest growing wireless audio brands in the industry.
ZAGG Products
Products under the ZAGG brand are designed to empower people to live their lives unleashed. Mobility is changing how consumers do everything in their lives and we seek to drive the mobile lifestyle forward with products that are designed to allow consumers to be productive and connected at work, at play, and at rest. ZAGG products, which include keyboards and cases, are designed to free consumers from the confines of the traditional workplace. We believe “getting away” shouldn’t mean being disconnected. As such, our ZAGG products are designed to feature cutting-edge design and innovation to provide portability, style, and productivity that can keep up with even the most active mobile users. We support the communicators, commuters, creators, and closers who live a mobile lifestyle. With the right ZAGG mobile accessories, we believe no one ever needs to feel tethered or held back.
ZAGG keyboards are designed to offer consumers an enhanced and innovative productivity experience. Since entering this category, we have continually reinvented the ZAGG line of keyboards while also providing timely, curated solutions for new devices released by Apple, Microsoft®, and Samsung, as well as other leading mobile device providers. In addition to device-specific keyboards and folio keyboard cases, the ZAGG line of universal full-size Bluetooth keyboards are designed to be compatible with virtually any device and mobile operating system. During 2018, we expanded our keyboard lineup with the Flex® universal keyboard and stand, which features a slim and portable design. The Flex universal keyboard can work with any Bluetooth device and make data entry fast and easy by eliminating hunt-and-peck typing. In early 2019, we unveiled the Slim Book™ Go, Rugged Book™ Go, and Messenger Folio™ keyboards for iPad and iPad Pro models which feature a protective, yet lightweight design that boasts backlit, laptop-style keys for ultimate productivity in today’s on-the-go world.
We continue to innovate and expand our wireless keyboard product lines as end users’ requirements evolve in this rapidly changing market.
Our Strategy
The focus of our business is to (1) design creative product solutions for users of mobile devices, (2) sell these products to consumers through targeted global distribution partners, retail partners, and online, (3) drive operational excellence across the organization, and (4) become the preferred brand through emphasizing innovation and product-quality, providing excellent customer service, and focusing on the end-users’ experience with our products. We focus our corporate, team, and individual goals to accomplish these overall corporate objectives.
We plan to continue to expand our product offerings, including competing in new product categories and entering new domestic and global markets that we believe will be consistent with our overall corporate strategy. We believe that by innovating with existing product categories, entering new geographic markets, and competing in new product categories, we can achieve our stated objectives and meet our strategic goals.
Design and Packaging
We design our InvisibleShield Film and Glass products for application on thousands of specific electronic devices. Our logistics partners acquire precision-cut raw materials from exclusive third-party suppliers. These precision-cut InvisibleShield Film and Glass products either use the EZ Apply tabs installation or are packaged with an installation kit consisting of a moisture adhesive-activating solution, a squeegee, and instructions for application on specific electronic devices. We have established relationships with package assembly, shipping, and logistics companies worldwide that we expect will allow us to expand production and shipping capacity for InvisibleShield Film and Glass production as we continue to grow and enter new markets.
We also customize each InvisibleShield Film cut design for the specific electronic device and currently have thousands of unique designs. Each cut design is developed internally and is owned exclusively by us. We do not own the patent for the raw materials, which is held by our exclusive supplier. Our InvisibleShield Film supplier has contractually agreed to not sell the base materials to any of our competitors. We believe that our relationship with the manufacturer of the raw material is on excellent terms and anticipate no interruption in our ability to acquire adequate supplies of raw materials and produce products.
We manufacture our other mobile device accessories (InvisibleShield Glass, keyboards, keyboard cases, audio products, cases, power cases, mobile power solutions, wireless charging solutions, and other accessories) using third party contract manufacturers located primarily in Asia. We have established relationships with third-party manufacturers, package assembly, warehousing, shipping, and logistics companies that allow us to expand our accessories production and shipping capacity as we continue to grow our current customer base and enter new markets.
For all our products, we design the exterior packaging to ensure it is consistent with the overall marketing strategy and is consistent with the desires of our major retailer partners. We have designed the hard plastic and cardboard box packaging to be informative and attractive for point-of-sale displays. We outsource the production of packaging to various independent third parties.
Market for Products
Portable electronic devices, notably handheld devices, continue to advance in performance and functionality. Furthermore, the market is expanding as evidenced by continued innovative new product releases, particularly in smartphones and tablets. Correspondingly, the aesthetics of such devices are increasingly important as buyers typically consider the look and feel of such devices, as much as performance, in making their purchasing decisions.
As a result, a significant market has emerged for protecting portable electronic devices, notably the “high end” tablet and smartphone devices, and enhancing the consumer experience by providing power, audio, and other accessories for mobile electronic devices.
We sell each of our product lines to consumers of electronic and hand-held devices directly through our websites and other key online retailers, and through our global distribution and retail partners. We sell a significant amount of product for use on Apple’s iPhone and iPad devices, and Samsung Galaxy® smartphones and tablets, although we have experienced continued diversification as other manufacturers’ presence in the market has increased.
In addition to Apple and Samsung devices noted above, the handheld electronics industry has continued to develop and market devices with touch screen interfaces, and several major manufacturers, including Google, Microsoft, Amazon®, Motorola®, Dell®, Lenovo®, Blackberry®, Xiaomi®, Huawei®, and HTC®, continue to release innovative products each year. The InvisibleShield product line is the ideal device protection offering for all types of touchscreen devices, as it does not interfere with the functionality of the device while offering complete scratch-proof protection. Our ZAGG keyboard product line is ideal for tablet and smartphone users as the product line includes keyboards that are both device-specific and device-agnostic, which are compatible with many tablet and smartphone devices. In addition, our IFROGZ audio product line offers excellent enhancement to any mobile device and BRAVEN audio product line provides high-end audio quality for outdoor adventure. Our mophie power cases and power management line and our newly acquired HALO power product line are viewed as a potential opportunity for significant future growth as mobile devices become more ingrained in our day-to-day lives. Lastly, with our recently-acquired Gear4 protective case line, we offer stylish smartphone cases made with the innovative D3O material that provides the best protection to phone devices. We intend to continue to focus our marketing and innovation efforts around these types of product solutions that protect and enhance mobile devices.
Market Segments
With thousands of InvisibleShield products/product configurations available, we have a protective covering available for all major market segments of handheld electronic devices, including smartphones, tablets, notebook computers, laptops, gaming devices, smartwatches, and similar devices and surfaces. We intend to continue to configure the InvisibleShield product for use in newly developed consumer devices. The InvisibleShield can be quickly configured, packaged, and shipped to customers for new devices as they enter the consumer marketplace, making our InvisibleShield available for purchase at the time of or within days of the launch of new electronic devices. Equally important, ISOD, our solution used to cut an InvisibleShield for virtually any mobile device in seconds, makes it possible for retailers to have an InvisibleShield available on the launch date for all device releases.
One of the strongest market segments currently is the smartphone segment. Along with the tablet market, buyers are drawn to these devices by their elegant design, as well as their easy-to-use functionality. However, everyday use often mars the finish of the devices’ screens and other areas that receive wear and tear. InvisibleShield protection products, as well as ZAGG, mophie, and Gear4 branded cases, offer excellent device protection, while not impeding the style and the form or functionality of the smartphones and tablets and do not inhibit the touch sensitivity for smartphones and tablets with touch screen technology. Specifically, the recent addition of VisionGuard technology to our InvisibleShield products enables us to help device users protect their eyesight while using their mobile devices. Further, our ZAGG keyboard line provides a professional and innovative solution with stylish and lightweight design to interact with tablets and smartphones that boasts ultimate productivity for the users. Our IFROGZ audio line enables technology-rich audio experiences from well-designed and intuitive products. Lastly, the mophie ecosystem provides both power and protection accessories for virtually any mobile device.
With our acquisition of BRAVEN Audio, we are able to offer the toughest audio products with high-end sound quality to outdoor enthusiasts who now can enjoy an incredible audio experience virtually anywhere they go. Such high quality audio products, together with our existing global distribution channel, will enable us to increase our visibility in this particular market.
With the addition of Gear4 to our portfolio of brands, we are better enabled to provide top-of-the-line and modern case protection using D3O technology to protect and accessorize today's mobile devices used by consumers around the world.
HALO adds new distribution channels to our portfolio, including HALO's strong relationship with QVC, a global leader in televised home shopping and e-commerce. By adding HALO to its portfolio of brands, we will be unique at offering, at scale, HALO's innovative products and be better positioned to address the evolving needs of consumers around the world.
As sales of consumer electronics continue to grow, we anticipate that sales of our complementary accessory products will also continue to grow. One of our largest areas of market opportunity relates to the sale of our products in conjunction with the release of new smartphones and tablets. Management believes that we are positioned to serve market needs within this industry with our multiple product lines that include screen protection, power cases, power management, wireless charging, audio, mobile keyboards, protective cases, and other mobile accessories.
Marketing and Distribution
Domestically, we sell our products on our websites, to big box electronics retailers, wireless retailers, other product distributors and retailers, and franchisees that operate cellphone repair locations, kiosks, and ZAGG-branded stores in shopping malls and retail centers. In addition, our products are available for sale worldwide through our websites as well as through retailers and distributors we have partnered with from our subsidiaries in Ireland, China and other international locations. Currently, we advertise our products primarily on the internet, on television through QVC spotlights, through print advertisements in conjunction with our retail partners, and through point of sale displays at retail locations. We intend to continue to strategically expand our advertising activities in 2019, particularly through point of sales displays within retailers, social media campaigns on the internet, and on QVC. We are also seeking to create and improve strategic partnerships with makers of smartphones and tablets, electronic accessories, and mobile content providers to enhance our product offerings.
Indirect Channels (amounts in thousands)
We sell our products through indirect channels, including big box retailers, wireless retailers, domestic and international distributors, independent Apple retailers, university bookstores, and small independently owned consumer electronics stores. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold $473,923 of product, or approximately 88% of our overall net sales through this channel. We enter into reseller agreements with many of our indirect channel partners.
We continue to sell directly to retailers or through distributors to market and place our products for sale in the U.S. and non-U.S. markets. We have entered into distribution agreements with partners throughout the world for the marketing, distribution and sale of our products.
Website Sales (amounts in thousands)
We sell our products worldwide directly to consumers on our websites at www.ZAGG.com, www.mophie.com, www.Gear4.com, and www.HALO.com.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold $42,685 of product, or approximately 8% of our overall net sales, through our websites.
Franchises (amounts in thousands)
In addition to operating a corporate ZAGG-branded store, we sell our products to franchisees that operate cellphone repair locations, kiosks, and ZAGG-branded stores in shopping malls and retail centers. We enter into agreements with third-party franchisees who then purchase our products and resell them to consumers. As part of the standard franchise agreement, franchisees are charged an up-front fee that is recognized into revenue over the life of the franchise term on a straight-line basis.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold $21,623 of product, or approximately 4% of our overall net sales, through franchisees and our corporate owned store.
Warranties
All our products purchased by consumers through authorized retailers have varying levels of warranty coverage. For InvisibleShield branded products, we offer a limited lifetime warranty. If the InvisibleShield product is ever scratched or damaged in the course of normal use, a customer may return the old product and we will replace it at no cost to the customer other than a minimal handling fee. The devices to which the InvisibleShield product is applied typically have relatively short lives, which helps to limit our exposure for warranty claims. Should products cease to function properly, we also offer manufacturer's warranties for our products. For ZAGG, IFROGZ, and BRAVEN branded products, we offer a one-year manufacturer's warranty and for mophie branded products, we offer a two-year manufacturer's warranty. For Gear4 branded products, we offer a limited lifetime warranty. HALO does not offer an extended manufacturer's warranty.
Suppliers
We do not directly manufacture any of our products, rather we employ various third-party manufacturing partners in the U.S. and Asia to perform these services on our behalf. The services employed by these third parties include the selection of sub-suppliers that provide raw materials and other components used in the manufacturing process. We have endeavored to use common components and readily available raw materials in the design of our products that can be sourced from multiple sub-suppliers. However, raw film used in our InvisibleShield Film and ISOD products has been produced by a single supplier for the last 10 years. Our InvisibleShield Film supplier has contractually agreed to not sell the raw materials to any of our competitors.
Below is a high-level summary by product category of the manufacturing sources used by us:
•Screen Protection – Our screen protection product line is comprised of InvisibleShield Glass products (approximately 86% of 2018 screen protection sales or 49% of net sales), InvisibleShield Film products (approximately 9% of 2018 screen protection sales or 5% of net sales), and ISOD film blanks (approximately 5% of 2018 screen protection sales or 3% of net sales). Our InvisibleShield Glass products are sourced from factories in Asia with protective glass expertise, each of which uses a number of sub-suppliers for raw materials and other components. Our InvisibleShield Film and ISOD products are sourced through our third-party logistics partner, who purchases the raw film inventory from a single supplier (as discussed above). The VisionGuard raw materials are provided to the manufacturers through an exclusive licensing agreement with a third-party partner.
•Protective Cases – Our protective case product line consists of (1) ZAGG cases designed to protect device specific mobile devices, and (2) Gear4 cases featuring D3O technology designed to protect smartphones and tablets. Our protective cases are sourced from factories in Asia with expertise in case protection manufacturing, each of which uses a number of sub-suppliers for raw materials and other components. For Gear4, the D3O raw materials are provided to our manufacturers through an exclusive licensing agreement with a third-party partner who is the sole manufacturer of D3O materials.
•Power Management – Our power management product line consists of power products that are designed to provide on-the-go power for tablets, smartphones, smartwatches, cameras, and virtually all other electronic mobile devices. With the addition of HALO, our power management product line includes power stations, wireless charging, car and wall chargers, portable power, power wallets, and more. Our power products are sourced from factories in Asia with battery expertise, each of which uses a number of sub-suppliers for raw materials and other components.
•Audio – Our audio product line consists of earbuds, headphones, and speakers that are designed to be compatible with virtually all electronic mobile devices. Our audio products are sourced from factories in Asia with audio expertise, each of which uses a number of sub-suppliers for raw materials and other components.
•Keyboards – Our keyboard product line consists of (1) device-specific keyboards designed to fit individual tablets produced by original equipment manufacturers, and (2) keyboards that are designed to be device-agnostic and can be used on virtually any mobile device. Our keyboard products are sourced from factories in Asia with keyboard expertise, each of which uses a number of sub-suppliers for raw materials and other components.
Our product and operations teams work closely with suppliers from initial product development and throughout the manufacturing process to ensure that (1) the supplier understands and will build according to product specifications, (2) appropriate quality is maintained for the finished goods and for all sub-components, and (3) the supplier can meet our supply needs.
Intellectual Property Rights
We own utility and design patents in the U.S. and in various foreign countries which correspond to a number of our products, including patents with claims focused on certain features of our InvisibleShield screen protection for electronic devices. Although we develop a portion of our IP through internal innovation, IP is also obtained through strategic acquisitions. We continue to actively pursue additional IP for our developing product portfolio, including patents and applications for our InvisibleShield screen protection and associated methods in the U.S. and in foreign countries, having filed patent applications for (i) both wet and dry application processes for securing protective InvisibleShield Film products to consumer electronic devices; (ii) dry-application protective InvisibleShield Film products; and (iii) on-demand production of electronic device accessories, including InvisibleShiled Film products. In addition, we have filed applications, and in some instances secured patents, for a variety of our battery cases, mobile power, wireless charging, keyboard, audio and protective case products. We have additional patents pending in the U.S. and internationally for a variety of current and expected products.
We own thousands of InvisibleShield Film designs for protecting a variety of consumer electronic devices. New designs are routinely added to our portfolio to accommodate the newest electronic devices on the market. Additionally, we are the owner of numerous trademarks for use in connection with our goods and services. We have acquired many trademarks through our strategic acquisitions, have filed formal applications for a variety of trademarks, and have further secured trademark registrations for many of our trademarks in both the U.S. and in foreign countries.
We have strategically developed relationships and, in some cases, exclusive agreements with third-party vendors and suppliers. Our long-standing relationships with raw material suppliers and manufacturers expand the scope of potential IP protection available to us, including development of innovative solutions for protective films and glass. These relationships also provide us with a reasonable expectation that we will be able to supply customers with products long into the future.
Our InvisibleShield Film, VisionGuard, and D3O suppliers retain the patents and IP rights for products developed on our behalf, though these suppliers have contractually agreed to not sell the raw materials to any of our competitors. IP protection held by us varies in effectiveness in preventing certain aspects of competition. Although we believe IP protection is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, or exclusive rights thereto, we view the following as our keys to past and future success: (1) our distribution relationships with customers, (2) the speed with which we can bring a product to market, and (3) our ability to effectively launch a product into market to generate maximum sales. We also believe our success is based upon creative product solutions, establishing the preferred brand among both retailers and consumers, targeted global distribution and operational excellence.
The addition of our BRAVEN, Gear4, and HALO brands has added to our expanding IP portfolio. We believe that this IP, which includes patent and trademark protections, will assist us in developing competitive advantages with our technology into the future.
Protection of IP is important to us and we protect IP when appropriate; however, we do not view IP in our industry as the key barrier to entry because of our rapidly changing industry. Often, by the time we receive patent or other IP protection on a product that would serve as a barrier to entry, the market has moved on to new technologies or products. Given this, we are selective in the IP we pursue, measuring the cost to protect certain aspects of IP against the potential benefit.
Due to our close partnership with suppliers in Asia, our third-party logistics partner, and the manufacturer of the raw film used in our InvisibleShield and ISOD products, our product development teams work directly with these partners in the development of products. Our key suppliers in Asia have contractually agreed that we will retain all patents and IP rights to products that arise through our relationship, including design changes and innovations regardless of who instigates the product development change.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 618 full-time and part-time employees, including our management team. 491 of our employees are located in the U.S. and support our domestic operations, while 127 employees are located outside the U.S. to support our international operations. No employee is represented by a labor union, and we have never suffered an interruption of business caused by labor disputes. We believe our relationship with our employees is good and have made efforts to ensure fair compensation, competitive benefits, and a positive working environment.
Our Corporate History
We are innovation leaders in mobile tech accessories for smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and other mobile technology. For over 10 years, we have developed creative product solutions that enhance and protect mobile devices for consumers around the world. We have an award-winning product portfolio that includes screen protection, power cases, power management, wireless charging, audio, mobile keyboards, protective cases, and other mobile accessories sold under the ZAGG, InvisibleShield, mophie, IFROGZ, BRAVEN, Gear4, and HALO brands.
In June 2011, we acquired IFROGZ, an audio company, which expanded our product lines beyond screen protection and keyboards.
In March 2016, we acquired mophie, a leader in the power management and power case categories. This acquisition further diversified our product lines into key growth product categories. The results of operations of mophie are included in our results of operations beginning on March 3, 2016.
In July 2018, we acquired BRAVEN, a rugged Bluetooth speakers and earbuds provider, which offers a high quality audio experience for outdoor adventurers. This new product line and brand enables us to reach new markets and customer demographics. The results of operations of BRAVEN are included in our results of operations beginning on July 20, 2018.
In November 2018, we acquired Gear4, one of the top selling smartphone case brands in the U.K., for its stylish phone cases which are designed with D3O technology. D3O technology can provide incredible protection to smartphones and other electronic devices by using shock absorbing materials. We believe this acquisition will expand our product offering to better meet the needs of our smartphone consumers for innovative case protection. The results of operations of Gear4 are included in our results of operations beginning on December 1, 2018.
In January 2019, we acquired HALO, a leading direct-to-consumer accessories company with an extensive IP portfolio. HALO designs, develops and markets innovative technology products to make consumers' lives easier. This acquisition will enable us to enter new distribution channels, and to leverage new technology to enter into new consumer markets. The results of operations of HALO are not included in our results of operations as the acquisition closed in January 2019.
Seasonal Business
We have historically been positively impacted near the time of major device launches by Apple, Samsung, Google, and other device manufacturers, particularly when there is a change in form factor. We expect major device launches to continue to positively impact our operations during 2019 and beyond.
