ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We design and manufacture semiconductor products for Telecommunications (“Telecom”), Industrial and Defense (“I&D”) and Data Center industries. Headquartered in Lowell, Massachusetts, with operational facilities throughout North America, Europe and Asia, we design, develop and manufacture differentiated semiconductor products for customers who demand high performance, quality and reliability. We have more than 70 years of application expertise, combined with expertise in analog and mixed signal circuit design, compound semiconductor fabrication (including gallium arsenide (“GaAs”), gallium nitride (“GaN”), indium phosphide (“InP”) and specialized silicon), advanced packaging and back-end assembly and test. We offer a broad portfolio of thousands of standard and custom devices, which include integrated circuits (“IC”), multi-chip modules (“MCM”), diodes, amplifiers, switches and switch limiters, passive and active components and complete subsystems, across dozens of product lines serving over 6,000 end customers in three primary markets. Our semiconductor products are electronic components that our customers generally incorporate into larger electronic systems, such as wireless communication systems including basestations, high-capacity optical networks, data center applications, radar, medical systems and test and measurement applications. Our primary end markets are: (1) Telecom, which includes carrier infrastructure such as long-haul/metro, 5G and Fiber-to-the-X (“FTTx”)/passive optical network (“PON”), among others; (2) I&D, which includes military and commercial radar, radio frequency (“RF”) jammers, electronic countermeasures, communication data links, satellite communications and multi-market applications, which include industrial, medical, test and measurement and scientific applications; and (3) Data Center, which includes intra-Data Center, Data Center Interconnect (“DCI”) applications, at 100G, 200G, 400G, 800G and higher speeds, enabled by our broad portfolio of analog ICs and photonic components for high speed optical module customers.
Many of our products have long life cycles ranging from five to ten years, and some of our products have been generating revenue for over 20 years. We continue to develop new products and technologies to improve our ability to serve our primary markets. Our growth strategy is focused on expanding our addressable markets and product portfolio, strengthening our customer relationships and capturing more design wins in order to increase our market share. As we grow our portfolio and technology base, we believe our customers will select more of our components for use in their systems.
Our manufacturing model consists of domestic semiconductor wafer fabrication assembly and test capabilities coupled with domestic and international external foundry and assembly and test partners. We operate semiconductor fabrication facilities at our Lowell, Massachusetts headquarters and in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Certain of our facilities have achieved certification to the IATF16949 automotive standard, the AS9100D aerospace standard, the ISO9001 international quality standard, the ISO14001 environmental management standard and the ANSI/ESD S20.20:2014 standard. We manufacture compound semiconductors including GaAs, GaN and InP. We have been accredited by the United States Department of Defense with “Trusted Foundry” status, a designation conferred on microelectronics vendors exhibiting the highest levels of process integrity and protection. In the I&D 
markets, a domestic fabrication facility may be a requirement to be a strategic supplier, and we believe our status as a Trusted Foundry offers us further competitive differentiation.
We also utilize external semiconductor foundries to access additional process technologies and provide additional capacity. We believe that our ability to utilize a broad array of internal proprietary process technologies and commercially available foundry technologies allows us to select the most appropriate technology to solve our customers’ needs. We believe that this strategy provides us with dependable supply, control over quality, reduced capital investment requirements, faster time to market and additional outsourced capacity when needed. In addition, the experience base cultivated through the continued operation of our internal fabrication lines provides us with the expertise to better manage our external foundry suppliers.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts are directed toward the rapid development of new and innovative products, process technologies and packaging techniques. The interaction of semiconductor process technology, circuit design and packaging technology defines the performance parameters and the competitive differentiation of our products. We believe some of our core competencies are the ability to model, design, test, integrate, package and manufacture differentiated solutions for our customers. We leverage these core competencies to solve difficult and complex challenges that our customers face during their system design phases. We believe our integrated and customized solutions offer customers high performance, quality, reliability and faster time to market.
Circuit design and device modeling expertise. Our engineers are experts in the design of analog and mixed signal circuits capable of reliable, high-performance RF, microwave, millimeter wave and optical signal transmission and conditioning. Our staff has decades of experience in solving complex design challenges in applications involving high frequency, high power and environmentally rugged operating conditions. 
Semiconductor process technology. We leverage our domestic semiconductor wafer fabrication capabilities and our foundry suppliers to offer customers the right process technology to meet their particular requirements. Depending on the requirements for the application, our semiconductor products may be designed using an internally developed or externally sourced process technology.
Packaging expertise. Our extensive packaging expertise enables us to model the interaction between the semiconductor and its package. Our engineers adjust the design of both the semiconductor and the package, to optimize performance. We offer products in a variety of different package types for specific applications, including plastic over-molded, ceramic and laminate-based packaging.
We continue to invest in proprietary processes and packaging technologies to enable us to develop and manufacture high-value solutions. Our engineers’ radar, optical, microwave and millimeter wave system-level design expertise allow us to offer differentiated solutions that leverage multiple process technologies and are integrated into a single, higher-level assembly, thereby delivering our customers enhanced functionality.
Our Markets and Products
Our core strategy is to develop and innovate high-performance products that address our customers’ technical challenges in our primary markets: Telecom, I&D and Data Center. While sales in any or all of our primary markets may slow or decline from period to period, over the long term we generally expect to benefit from growth in these markets. We expect our revenue in the Telecom market to be driven, in part, by 5G deployments and expansion of optical networks, with continued upgrades and expansion of communications equipment and increasing adoption of bandwidth-rich services. We expect our revenue in the I&D market to be driven by the expansion of our product portfolio which services test and measurement, satellite communications, civil and military radar, scientific, medical and other industrial applications. We expect revenue growth in the Data Center market to be driven by the adoption of cloud-based services and the upgrade of data center architectures to 100G, 200G, 400G and 800G interconnects, which we expect will drive adoption of higher speed optical and photonic wireless links. 
Telecom. Underlying growth in the Telecom market is driven by the ever-growing need for increased bandwidth to support data rich applications and services such as video conferencing, cloud computing, video-on-demand and social media. Growth in next-generation Internet and Internet of Things applications drives global demand for communications infrastructure equipment requiring amplifiers, filters, receivers, switches, synthesizers, transformers, upconverters and other components to expand and upgrade cellular backhaul, cellular infrastructure, wired broadband and fiber optic networks. Semiconductor products and solutions must continually deliver greater bandwidth and functionality as the demands of our customers and end users increase.
Our expertise in system-level architectures and advanced IC design capability enables us to offer network original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers highly integrated solutions optimized for performance and cost. Our portfolio of opto-electronics products includes clock and data recovery, optical post amplifiers, laser and modulator drivers, transimpedance amplifiers, transmitter and receiver applications in 2.5/10/40/100/400 gigabits per second long haul, metro, data center links and FTTx fiber optic network components that enable telecommunications carriers and data centers to cost-efficiently increase their network capacity by a factor of four to ten times over earlier generation solutions. We match our opto-electronic components to our laser and photodetector products enabling our customers to buy more complete solutions for their opto-electronic systems. For optical communications applications, we utilize a proprietary combination of GaAs, InP and Silicon Germanium (“SiGe”) technologies to obtain advantages in performance and 
size. For wired broadband applications, we offer OEM customers the opportunity to streamline their supply chain through our broad catalog of active components such as active splitters, amplifiers, multi-function ICs and switches, as well as passive components such as transformers, diplexers, filters, power dividers and combiners.
Industrial & Defense. In the I&D market, military applications require advanced electronic systems, such as radar warning receivers, communications data links and tactical radios, unmanned aerial vehicles, RF jammers, electronic countermeasures and smart munitions. Military applications are becoming more sophisticated and requiring more high-speed bandwidth, favoring higher performance semiconductor ICs based on GaAs and GaN technologies due to their high power density, improved power efficiency and broadband capability. 
We believe our analog design capabilities, technology portfolio, in-depth knowledge of critical radar system requirements, integration expertise and track record of reliability make us a valued resource for our I&D customers faced with demanding application parameters. Further, we have been accredited by the United States Department of Defense with Trusted Foundry status which we believe differentiates us as a trusted manufacturer of ICs for U.S. military and aerospace applications. For radar applications, we offer standard and custom amplifiers, discrete components, switch limiters, phase shifters and integrated modules for transmit and receive functions in air traffic control, marine, weather, and military radar applications. For military communications data link and tactical radio applications, we offer a family of active, passive and discrete products, such as Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (“MMICs”), control components, voltage-controlled oscillators (“VCOs”), transformers, power pallets, amplifiers and diodes. We believe manufacturing products in our Lowell, Massachusetts Trusted Foundry offers us a competitive advantage in the I&D market because of certain customers’ requirements for a domestic supply chain.
Growth in the I&D business is also driven by multi-market applications encompassing industrial, medical, test and measurement and scientific applications, where analog RF, microwave and millimeter wave semiconductor solutions are gaining prevalence. In addition, evolving medical technology has increased the need for high-performance MMICs and other semiconductor solutions in medical imaging and patient monitoring to provide enhanced analysis and functionality.
In the medical industry, our custom designed non-magnetic diode product line is a critical component for certain MRI applications. For sensing and test and measurement applications, we believe our HMIC process is ideal for high-performance, integrated bias networks and switches. Our catalog of general purpose GaAs ICs includes low noise amplifiers, switches and power amplifiers that address a wide range of applications such as industrial automation systems to test and measurement equipment.
Data Center. Demand by Cloud Data Center providers for faster data delivery speeds at cost-effective prices is growing rapidly, where higher speeds are necessary to process the current growth in traffic. To solve these challenges, we leverage our broad optical and photonic portfolio of products to enable our customers to deliver optical transceivers that meet the requirements of today’s Cloud Data Center deployments. By building a comprehensive portfolio of complementary products that enable our customers’ optical transceiver applications, we can offer high performing, cost-effective component solutions for next-generation networks.
We enable the market with a complete product portfolio of PAM-4 PHYs, TIAs, Modulator Drivers, Lasers, Photodetectors and Silicon Photonics, and, in some cases, individual component designs are optimized for use together as a chipset.
To address our primary markets, we offer a broad range of standard and custom ICs and components. Our product catalog currently consists of thousands of products including the following key product platforms: amplifiers, ICs, diodes, switches and switch limiters, passive and active components and multi-chip modules. Many of our product platforms are leveraged across multiple markets and applications. For example, our application expertise in power amplifier technology is leveraged across both scientific laboratory equipment applications and commercial and defense radar system applications.

Sales and Marketing
We employ a global multi-channel sales strategy and support model intended to facilitate customers’ evaluations and selections of our products. We sell through our direct sales force, our application engineering staff, our global network of independent sales representatives, resellers and distributors. We have strategically positioned our direct sales and applications engineering staff in locations worldwide, augmented by independent sales representatives and distributors with additional domestic and foreign locations to offer responsive local support resources to our customers and to build long-term relationships. Our application engineers visit customers at their engineering and manufacturing facilities, aid them in understanding our capabilities and collaborate with them to deliver products that can optimize their system performance. Our global independent sales representatives and distributor network allow us to extend our sales capabilities to new customers in new geographies more cost effectively than using our direct sales force alone.
Our products are principally sold in North America, Asia and Europe, which is where we concentrate our direct sales force, applications engineering staff, independent sales representatives and distributors. Sales to our distributors accounted for 30.9%, 35.0% and 45.3% of our revenue in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our agreements with sales representatives, resellers and distributors may provide for an initial term of one or more years with the opportunity for subsequent renewals or for an indefinite term, and also typically provide that either party may terminate the agreement for convenience with a minimum period of prior notice to the other party, usually between 30 and 90 days.
Our sales efforts are focused on the needs of our customers in our three primary markets rather than on particular product lines, facilitating product cross-selling across end markets, and within key accounts. Through our website, customers can inquire about our products, request samples and access our product selection guides, detailed product brochures and data sheets, application notes, suggested design block diagrams and test fixture information, technical articles and information regarding quality and reliability.
Customers
Our customer base is diversified and includes OEM customers, contract manufacturers, resellers and distributors. One of our distributors, Richardson RFPD, Inc., (“Richardson”), accounted for 10.7% and 13.5% of our revenue in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, but did not exceed 10% in fiscal year 2022. Sales to two other resellers, Gateway Tech Company Limited (“Gateway”) and Pangaea (H.K.) Limited (“Pangaea”), both individually accounted for 11.5% of our revenue in fiscal year 2020, but did not individually exceed 10% in fiscal years 2022 or 2021. For fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, no direct customer individually accounted for 10% or more of our revenue and sales to our top 25 direct customers accounted for an aggregate of 47.1%, 43.7% and 40.0% of our revenue, respectively.
Our orders from and sales to customers in the telecommunications infrastructure and networking markets may tend to be lower in our first fiscal quarter as compared to other quarters due to seasonal inventory management by large OEM and contract manufacturing customers. 
Competition
The markets for our products are highly competitive and are characterized by continuously evolving customer requirements. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include:
▪the ability of engineering talent to drive innovation and new product development;
▪the ability to timely design and deliver products and solutions that meet or exceed customers’ performance, reliability and price requirements;
▪the breadth and diversity of product offerings;
▪the ability to provide a reliable supply of products in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner;
▪the quality of customer service and technical support; and
▪the financial reliability, operational stability and reputation of the supplier.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors. We compete primarily with both our customers’ internal design resources and other suppliers of high-performance analog semiconductor solutions for use in wireless and wireline RF, microwave, millimeter wave and photonic applications, some of whom have greater financial resources and scale than us. We expect competition in our markets to change as new competitors enter these markets, existing competitors merge or form alliances and new technologies emerge. We believe that in the future there will be increased competition from companies utilizing alternative technologies, including high-volume manufacturers using low-cost silicon process technology. Some of our competitors are also our customers, and in certain product categories we compete with semiconductor manufacturers from which we also obtain foundry services.
We compete with Analog Devices, Inc. (“ADI”), Broadcom Inc. (“Broadcom”), Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd. (“Credo”), Marvell Technology Inc. (“Marvell”), MaxLinear Inc. (“MaxLinear”), Microchip Technology Incorporated (“Microchip”), 
NXP Semiconductors N.V. (“NXP”), Qorvo, Inc. (“Qorvo”), Semtech Corporation (“Semtech”), Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (“Skyworks”) and Wolfspeed, Inc. (“Wolfspeed”).
Backlog and Inventory
Our sales are made primarily on a purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-term contracts where the customer commits to buy any minimum amount of product over an extended period. We also frequently ship products from our inventory shortly after receipt of an order, which we refer to as “turns business.” Unanticipated fluctuations in turns business may result in material shifts in revenue between fiscal quarters. Due to the foregoing factors, different ordering patterns of our customers and the wide range of lead times to produce and deliver our products, we believe that backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels. 
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants.
 As of September 30, 2022, we had 574 U.S. and 187 foreign issued patents and 103 U.S. and 148 foreign pending patent applications covering elements of semiconductor devices, circuit design, manufacturing and wafer fabrication. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2022 to 2041. We do not regard any of the patents scheduled to expire in the next twelve months as material to our overall intellectual property portfolio. Notwithstanding our active pursuit of patent protection when available, we believe that our future success will be determined by the innovation, technical expertise and management abilities of our engineers and management more than by patent ownership.
The semiconductor industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. Many of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which may in the future require that we defend those claims and might require that we pay damages in the case of adverse rulings. Claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any intellectual property rights claims against us or our customers or distributors, we may be required to cease manufacture of the infringing product, pay damages or settlement amounts, expend resources to develop non-infringing technology, seek a license, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or relinquish patents or other intellectual property rights. 
Manufacturing, Sources of Supply and Raw Materials
When designing a product solution for our customers, we may choose to utilize our internal proprietary process technologies or technologies from external fabrication facilities, or a combination of both. We believe our ability to select both internal and external technologies in our product solutions is a competitive advantage because it helps us to provide a unique and optimized solution for our customers.
Our internal wafer fabrication and the majority of our internal assembly and test operations are conducted at our Lowell, Massachusetts headquarters. We believe having U.S.-based wafer fabrication is a competitive advantage for us over competitors that do not have this capability, because it enables us to offer proprietary processes, and provides us with greater control over quality, a secure source of supply and a domestic source for U.S. I&D customers. We also believe that our U.S.-based wafer fabrication facilitates shorter time to market for both new and existing products, shorter production lead times than if we utilized external foundries and allows us to efficiently produce a wide range of low, medium and high-volume products. We perform internal assembly and test functions at our Lowell, Massachusetts, Nashua, New Hampshire, Ann Arbor, Michigan and Hsinchu, Taiwan locations.
We complement our internal manufacturing with outsourced foundry partners and other suppliers. Our operations team has extensive expertise in the management of outsourced manufacturing service providers and other supply chain participants. We believe our fab-lite model of outsourcing certain of our manufacturing activities rather than investing heavily in capital-intensive production facilities provides us with the flexibility to respond to new market opportunities, simplifies operations, provides access to a wider array of process technologies and additional manufacturing capacity and reduces our capital requirements. We also use third-party contract manufacturers for assembly, packaging and test functions, and in some cases for fully outsourced turnkey manufacturing of our products.
The principal materials used in the production of our IC products are high purity source materials such as gallium, aluminum, arsenic, nitrite, carbon and silicon. We purchase a wide variety of semiconductors, wafers, packages, metals, printed circuit boards, electromechanical components and other materials from hundreds of suppliers worldwide for use in our operations. These supply relationships are generally conducted on a purchase order basis. The use of external suppliers involves a number of risks, including the possibility of material disruptions in the supply of key raw materials and components, and the lack of control over delivery schedules, capacity, quality and costs.
While we attempt to maintain alternative sources for our principal raw materials to reduce the risk of supply interruptions or price increases, some of the raw materials and components are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique nature, design or the length of time necessary for re-design or qualification. We routinely utilize single sources of supply for various materials based on availability, performance, efficiency or cost considerations. For example, wafers procured from merchant foundries for a particular process technology are generally sourced through a single foundry on which we rely for all of our wafers in that process. Our reliance on external suppliers puts us at risk of supply chain disruption if a supplier does not have sufficient raw material inventory to meet our manufacturing needs, goes out of business, experiences capacity constraints or temporary facility closures, changes or discontinues the process in which components or wafers are manufactured or declines to continue supplying us for competitive or other reasons, as discussed in more detail in “Item 1A - Risk Factors” herein. Where practical, we attempt to mitigate these risks by qualifying multiple sources of supply, redesigning products for alternative components and purchasing incremental inventory of raw materials and components in order to protect us against supply disruptions.
Quality Assurance
The goal of our quality assurance program is for our products to meet our customers’ requirements, be delivered on time, and function reliably throughout their useful lives. The ISO provides models for quality assurance for various operational disciplines, such as design, manufacturing, and testing, which comprise part of our overall quality management system. The following locations have each received ISO 9001:2015 certifications in one or more of their principal functional areas: Lowell, Massachusetts; Cork, Ireland; Ithaca, New York; Santa Clara and Newport Beach, California; Morrisville, North Carolina; Ann Arbor, Michigan; Nashua, New Hampshire; and Hsinchu, Taiwan. The following facilities have also achieved certification to the AS9100D aerospace standard: Lowell, Massachusetts; Morrisville, North Carolina; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and Nashua, New Hampshire. In addition, our Lowell, Massachusetts facility has received IATF16949 automotive quality management system certification and the ISO 14001:2015 environmental management system certification.
The ESD Association provides standards for safe and proper handling of electrostatic discharge (“ESD”) in electronic manufacturing environments. Our following locations have each received ANSI/ESD S20.20:2014 certification: Lowell, Massachusetts; Ann Arbor, Michigan; Allentown, Pennsylvania; Morrisville, North Carolina; Nashua, New Hampshire; and Hsinchu, Taiwan.
Environmental Regulation
Our operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment in the U.S. and other countries. These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants into the air, water and soil; remediation requirements; product chemical content limitations; manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions; pollution control requirements; waste minimization considerations; and requirements regarding the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. We are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions. While we are committed to compliance with applicable regulations, the risk of environmental liabilities can never be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to our business will not require us to incur material future expenditures.
We are also regulated under a number of federal, state and local laws regarding responsible sourcing, recycling, product packaging and product content requirements in the U.S. and other countries, including legislation enacted in the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions that have placed greater restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products, which affects materials composition and semiconductor packaging. These laws are becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur material expenditures or otherwise cause financial harm.
Export Regulations
We market and sell our products both inside and outside the U.S. Certain products are subject to the Export Administration Regulations, administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”), which require that we obtain an export license before we can export certain controlled products or technology to specified countries. Additionally, some of our products are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which restrict the export of information and material that may be used for military or intelligence applications by a foreign person. Similar controls exist in other jurisdictions. Failure to comply with these laws could result in sanctions by the government, including substantial monetary penalties, denial of export privileges and debarment from government contracts. We maintain an export compliance program staffed by dedicated personnel under which we screen export transactions against current lists of restricted exports, destinations and end users with the objective of managing export-related decisions, transactions and shipping logistics to ensure compliance with these requirements.
Human Capital
Employees. As of September 30, 2022, we employed approximately 1,200 individuals worldwide, including approximately 430 in research and development. We have employees across 17 countries, with 71% in North America, 20% in Asia Pacific and 9% in Europe. None of our domestic employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement; however, as of September 30, 2022, approximately 20 of our employees working in certain European locations were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with employees to generally be good and we have not experienced a work stoppage due to labor issues.
Approximately 70% and 30% of our workforce is male and female, respectively. Females represented approximately 11% of our senior management and approximately 15% of our engineering roles.
Corporate Culture and Employee Engagement. We are committed to fostering a corporate culture that encourages and seeks the betterment of the Company and the communities in which we conduct business. Through our charitable giving program, we encourage employees to volunteer up to eight hours per year to the communities in which we operate. Additionally, our employees engage directly with the community, volunteering their time to a number of organizations. We strive to foster a sense of community and well-being that encourages our employees to focus on both their and the Company’s long-term success. We realize that continuous engagement with our employees in a transparent, collaborative manner that builds trust is vital to driving successful outcomes. Executive management regularly conducts town hall-style meetings with employees to address business operations, strategy, market conditions and other topics. This format encourages open dialogue and provides employees with an opportunity to ask questions and voice opinions and ideas.
Retention and Development. We devote substantial efforts to retaining, motivating and supporting our employees, including by providing tuition and professional development reimbursement to eligible employees as well as opportunities for internal growth and advancement. Performance reviews are conducted at least annually for all employees, during which employees and managers address goals, development opportunities, strengths and areas for improvement. We have also maintained an internship program that supports the professional development of interns and serves as a recruitment tool for full-time employees. We monitor voluntary attrition as an indicator of employee engagement. During fiscal year 2022, our voluntary attrition rate was approximately 11%.
Compensation. Our compensation policies recognize and reward individual and collective contributions to our growth and success. We offer, among other things, competitive and balanced compensation programs commensurate with those of our peers and competitors, including, but not limited to, well-rounded healthcare, prescription drug and disability insurance benefits for our employees and their families, a 401(k) plan for our U.S.-based employees and similar retirement savings programs for certain of our non-U.S.-based employees with a matching contribution by the Company and an employee stock purchase plan. We provide competitive paid time-off benefits, a parental leave program following the birth, adoption or fostering of a child and an employee assistance plan that provides professional support, access to special programs and certain resources to our employees experiencing personal-, work-, financial- or family-related issues.
Diversity, Equity Inclusion & Belonging (DEI&B). We have a diverse employee base, serving a wide variety of customers across multiple geographies. We are strengthened by the broad diversity of our employees’ perspectives, backgrounds, cultures, lifestyles and experiences. 
We continue to create a culture of DEI&B in the workplace in order to promote and effect change at the corporate and community levels. We support establishing a work environment where everyone has equal opportunities to learn and grow. Our DEI&B efforts are guided by the following principles:
•Diversity is the representation of different people in an organization.
•Equity is ensuring that everyone has fair, just and equal opportunities at work.
•Inclusion is ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute to and influence every part and level of a workplace.
•Belonging is ensuring that everyone feels safe and welcome at work.
We regularly use our employee newsletter and communications meetings to share information, opportunities and updates with our workforce on our DEI&B and other initiatives. We are committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind. We maintain a policy against unlawful discrimination, harassment and retaliation which sets forth our position on the prohibition of all forms of discrimination and harassment in the workplace.
Safety, Health and Well-being. We have health and safety team members to support compliance requirements and also promote and encourage employees to maintain healthy and safe lifestyles. Our goal is to reduce the potential for injury or illness by maintaining safe working conditions, such as providing proper tools and training to all employees. Additionally, we offer resources to our employees to encourage healthy habits, such as health coaches, wellness incentives and a diabetes prevention program.
As a global organization, we followed and continue to follow local government guidance related to COVID-19 in every jurisdiction where we operate. In particular, we continue to follow government-issued orders, we have directed social distancing, we have minimized our in-person workforce and we continue to adhere to requirements for temporary site closures. We have 
implemented extensive onsite health and safety protocols to protect our employees, including onsite health screening, free private COVID-19 testing, and onsite COVID-19 vaccination clinics in our Lowell, Massachusetts headquarters. We also supported our workforce with advice and guidance on protecting their own health and the health of their families. We will continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees during the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic and thereafter.
History and Recent Developments
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in March 2009. Our operations are conducted through our various subsidiaries, which are organized and operated according to the laws of their respective jurisdictions of incorporation.
MACOM Technology Solutions Inc., our primary operating subsidiary, which provides high-performance analog semiconductor solutions for use in wireless and wireline applications across the RF, microwave, millimeter wave and lightwave spectrum, was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on July 16, 2008. MACOM Technology Solutions Limited, our primary foreign operating subsidiary, was incorporated under the laws of Ireland on November 18, 2008. The heritage of some of our business operations dates back over 70 years to the founding of Microwave Associates, Inc. and the MACOM brand dates back over 30 years.
We have completed several acquisitions and divestitures to attempt to further align our businesses to our primary markets. Those transactions include:
In January 2017, we acquired Applied Micro Circuits Corporation (“AppliedMicro”), a global provider of silicon solutions for next-generation cloud infrastructure and Cloud Data Centers, as well as connectivity products for edge, metro and long-haul communications equipment (the “AppliedMicro Acquisition”) in order to expand our business in enterprise and Cloud Data Center applications.
In October 2017, following the acquisition of AppliedMicro, we divested AppliedMicro's Compute business (the “Compute business”) and received an equity interest in Ampere Computing Holdings LLC which we sold on December 23, 2021. See Note 4 - Investments to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for more information.
Our acquisition strategy is intended to accelerate our growth, expand our technology portfolio, grow our addressable market and create stockholder value. 
During the fiscal quarter ended June 28, 2019, we committed to a plan designed to strategically realign, streamline and improve certain of our business and operations, including reducing our workforce by approximately 250 employees, exiting six development facilities in France, Japan, the Netherlands, Florida, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, reducing certain development activities for one of our product lines and no longer investing in the design and development of optical modules and subsystems for Data Center applications (the “2019 Plan”). These restructuring actions were completed in fiscal year 2020.
COVID-19 Impact
COVID-19 has spread throughout areas of the world where we operate and resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus. As a result of these measures and the spread of COVID-19, we have modified our business practices and may further modify our practices as required, or as we determine appropriate. While these measures, as well as other disruptions, have impacted our operations, the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers, such impacts did not, through the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, have a material impact on our consolidated operating results. 
For additional information on risk factors that could impact our future results, please refer to “Item 1A - Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.

We maintain a website at www.macom.com, including an investors section, at which we routinely post important information, such as webcasts of quarterly earnings calls and other investor events in which we participate or host, and any related materials. We encourage investors to monitor our website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts, as well as our social media channels (MACOM’s LinkedIn, Facebook and YouTube pages and Twitter account (@MACOMtweets)). You may access our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, as well as other reports relating to us that are filed with or furnished to the SEC, free of charge in the investors section of our website as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. The contents of the websites mentioned above, as well as our LinkedIn, Facebook and YouTube pages and Twitter account, are not incorporated into and should not be considered a part of this report.
