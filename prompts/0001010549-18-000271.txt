 Corporate History
 UMED Holdings, Inc. (“UMED,” or the “company”) was incorporated in Texas on March 13, 2002.   UMED owns technology for converting natural gas to liquids, primarily diesel and jet fuel (“GTL”), mining claims on federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Southwest Arizona, a mamaki tea farm on 25 acres located on the big island in Hawaii, and oil rig drilling data management technology.  The Company is in the process of seeking funding to operate the mamaki tea farm in Hawaii, secure clients for the Logistix Technology for oil and gas drilling rigs technology software, build the GTL units, begin the mining operations on the BLM land.
 
The Company staked the BLM placer mining claims on the 1,440 acres in Arizona in September 2011, and, since then, has maintained the claims and will establish an exploration and development plan, when capital is available.
 
The Company purchased 80% of Mamaki Tea & Extract of Hawaii, Inc. in May of 2012 (nka Mamaki of Hawaii, Inc. (and the remaining 20% in December 2012), and, since then, has worked to bring the tea plant into production.  The Company has begun to harvest some tea leaves from its mamaki tea farm and place samples out with distribution chains to gage the desirability of our tea product.  The Company’s current plan is to work the mamaki tea farm to produce revenues that can sustain the Company while it seeks capital to launch the Logistic software, the mining on the BLM mining claims and GTL operations.
 
In August 2012, the Company acquired 50% of Rig Support Services, Inc. (nka Logistix Technology Systems, Inc.), which is developing a unique and valuable technology and asset management tool for the oil and gas industry.  In February 2013, we acquired the remaining 50%.  We believe that this tool will not only provide independent rig owners and operating companies the ability to more accurately view and report on drilling operations, it will also allow for a more streamlined approach to processing purchase orders and receiving parts.
 
In August of 2012, the Company acquired Greenway Innovative Energy, Inc. Greenway Innovative Energy (“GIE”) began work in 2009 on its gas-to-liquids (GTL) system to economically covert natural gas into high-cetane liquid fuels while making no wax product and avoiding the need for further refining. In 2011, Greenway Innovative Energy engaged Houston-based Commonwealth Engineering to design a 1,500 barrel/day GTL system based on steam methane reforming (SMR). SMR proved to be too expensive for commercialization. As a result, GIE embarked on a redesign of the reforming process. That redesigned process and methodology led to the issuance of patents in 2013 as described below.




On February 15, 2013, GIE filed for a patent on its GTL technology. U.S. Patent number 8,574,501 was issued on November 5, 2013.
 
ABSTRACT:
 A method and apparatus for converting natural gas from a source, such as a wellhead, pipeline, or a storage facility, into hydrocarbon liquid stable at room temperature, comprising a skid or trailer mounted portable gas to liquids reactor. The reactor includes a preprocessor which desulfurizes and dehydrates the natural gas, a first stage reactor which transforms the preprocessed natural gas into synthesis gas, and a liquid production unit using a Fischer-Tropsch or similar polymerization process. The hydrocarbon liquid may be stored in a portable tank for later transportation or further processed on site. 
 
On November 4, 2013, GIE filed for a second patent covering other aspects of the design.
 
Also, in November, 2013, GIE reinstated a Sponsored Research Agreement (“SRA”) with the University of Texas at Arlington (“UTA”). The original agreement was initiated in 2009 for GTL proof of concept, scalability, and portability. Under the 2013 agreement, and based on the GIE’s ideas and vision, UTA began research focused solely on catalyst studies for the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) component of the GIE’s GTL system design with a goal of developing a lab platform capable of running 24/7 catalyst testing for one week or longer to prove the viability and commerciality of the process. Under the agreement, parametric studies were conducted for process conditions including reaction temperature and space velocity.
 
During 2013, GIE and UTA worked closely together meeting weekly, and sometimes daily, to review FT catalyst alternatives, identifying those most efficient and optimized to yield synthetic diesel without wax or other compounds that would require refining.
 
In 2014, research conducted under the SRA established that a liquid product could be produced under the right combination of temperature, pressure, and flow velocity. Deviations from the defined conditions resulted in either catalyst activity loss, an undesired solid product (wax), or an undesired gaseous product (methane).
 
In 2014, GIE began work with Air Liquide on the development of the reforming process and entered into a contract for oxygen and for future patent rights to certain aspects of reforming process associated with GTL.
 
In 2014, the company engaged in unsuccessful exploratory work with Chicago Bridge & Iron to develop a smaller, less expensive SMR system. Separately, the company sought assistance from Schlumberger on Sulphur removal techniques in order to purify natural gas as part of the GTL process. Sulphur is detrimental to the system’s catalysts.
 
Also, in 2014, GIE worked with the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), under its Sponsored Research Agreement (SRA), to develop and enhance its patented GTL system with a goal of developing commercial GTL plants to convert natural gas into liquid fuels.
 
During 2014, the company continued to have weekly, and sometimes daily interactions with UTA to review results and modify research objectives.
 
During 2015, under the SRA with UTA, the company refined requirements around FT catalyst longevity and the optimization of syn-fuel productivity. In addition, research was conducted into the nature and purity of the water by-product from the FT reaction as well as the impact of CO2 contamination in the production of synthesis gas.
 
Also, during 2015, under the SRA, the Company launched a project to build a laboratory-scale GTL system at UTA for the purpose of refining and proving its proprietary GTL technology and engaged Thermal Dynamics, an industrial manufacturer and fabricator, to build a laboratory-scale prototype reformer in order to prove scalability and functionality. Numerous meetings were conducted with UTA, Air Liquide, and Thermal Dynamics regarding the planning for the laboratory-scale prototype.
 
During the year, the company continued to have weekly, and sometimes daily interactions with UTA to review and modify research objectives.

As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statement, the Company has incurred a cumulative deficit of $12,450,131 80 as of December 31, 2015. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is in doubt and dependent upon on the ability of the Company to obtain necessary capital and financing to fund ongoing operations and achieving a profitable level of operations. UMED does not have the financial resources and does not have any commitments for funding from unrelated parties or any other firm agreements that will provide working capital to its business segments. We cannot give any assurance that UMED will locate any funding or enter into any agreements that will provide the required operating capital. UMED has been depended on the sale of equity and advances from shareholders to provide it with working capital to date. 
 
UMED Strategy
 
UMED is a diversified holding company that owns and operates businesses in a variety of industries including energy and mining.  Our focus is to acquire businesses as wholly-owned subsidiaries that meet some key requirements: (1) solid management that will not have to be replaced in the near future, (2) the ability to grow with steady growth to follow, and (3) an emphasis on emerging core industry markets, such as energy and metals. 
 Operationally, the Company plans to initially focus on building the small scale model at UTA and the initial GTL field production unit, and drill test holes and test the samples on its Arizona placer mining claims to determine the potential value of the various metals that may be located on the claims.
 The Company plans to continue to develop and enhance its patented GTL system with a goal of commercial deployment to profitably harvest natural gas in a variety of forms including pipeline, flared, stranded, vented, coal-bed methane, or bio-mass.
 
The Company began work to fund a laboratory-scale GTL system which is expected to cost approximately $1,500,000. The Company plans to fund the research project through the sale of Company stock.
 Competition 
 Most of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, and there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete. 
 Currently, there is significant competition for personnel and financial capital to be deployed in the oil and gas extraction industries and mining and mineral extraction industries. Therefore, it is difficult for smaller companies such as UMED to attract investment for its various business activities. We cannot give any assurances that we will be able to compete for capital funds, and without adequate financial resources management cannot assure that the company will be able to compete in our business activities. 
 Intellectual Property 
 As of December 31, 2015, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary Greenway Innovative Energy, Inc. (GIE) owns US Patents 8,574,501 and 8,795,597 B2 covering its mobile Gas-to-Liquids ("GTL") conversion unit for the purpose of converting natural gas to clean synthetic fuels. U.S. Patent number 8,795,597 B2 was applied for on November 4, 2013. Patent number 9,795,597 B2 was issued on August 5, 2014 covering other aspects of the design.
 
ABSTRACT covering both patents:
 A method and apparatus for converting natural gas from a source, such as a wellhead, pipeline, or a storage facility, into hydrocarbon liquid stable at room temperature, comprising a skid or trailer mounted portable gas to liquids reactor. The reactor includes a preprocessor which desulfurizes and dehydrates the natural gas, a first stage reactor which transforms the preprocessed natural gas into synthesis gas, and a liquid production unit using a Fischer-Tropsch or similar polymerization process. The hydrocarbon liquid may be stored in a portable tank for later transportation or further processed on site.
 
In the United States, a patent's term may be up to 21 years if the earliest claimed filing date is that of a provisional application. Other legal provisions may, however, shorten or lengthen a patent's term. In the United States, a patent's term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent.  Alternatively, a patent's term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date.
