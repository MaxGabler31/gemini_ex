Overview
We design, develop and market gallium nitride (GaN) power integrated circuits (ICs) used in power conversion and charging. Power supplies incorporating our products may be used in a wide variety of electronics products including fast chargers for mobile phones and laptops, consumer electronics, data centers, solar inverters and electric vehicles, among numerous other applications.
Our products provide superior efficiency, performance, size, cost and sustainability relative to existing silicon technology. Our solutions offer faster charging, higher power density and greater energy savings compared to silicon-based power systems with the same output power. By unlocking this speed and efficiency, Navitas is leading a revolution in high-frequency, high-efficiency and high-density power electronics to electrify our world for a cleaner tomorrow.
Industry Overview
Most electronic devices that connect to a wall socket require a power supply to convert energy provided by utilities at 100-240V alternating current (AC) into lower voltage direct current (DC) required by most electronic devices. Power supplies can be located inside the devices they are powering, as is the case with many consumer electronics and home appliances, or outside of the device, as is typically the case with devices like mobile phone chargers or laptop computers, typically referred to as wall chargers or power adapters. In electronic devices today, most of these charging and power supply functions are carried out using silicon (Si) power MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Silicon Field Effect Transistors) or IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors), along with related analog peripheral semiconductors. As the electronic content and functionality of systems have increased over time, existing silicon-based solutions have struggled to achieve high energy efficiency and fast charging, and they require large heat sinks or other thermal management methods, and large or complex form factors.
At the highest level, GaN is a combination of gallium and nitrogen, which forms a powerful bond with materially stronger electric fields and greater electron mobility compared to silicon. With a GaN power IC, increased power system switching speeds and energy efficiency can be achieved, which translate into notable benefits for power electronics such as smaller size, lighter weight, higher density, faster charging, energy savings and ultimately a lower system cost. These are significant gains relative to existing Si-based power solutions. A transistor is at the heart of a power supply, and a discrete (that is, non-integrated) GaN transistor requires a specialized silicon driver and multiple other components to drive and protect that GaN transistor. This additional circuitry has limited the adoption of GaN over the last decade due to cost, complexity, size, and vulnerability to system transients. Navitas has solved this problem with the GaN power IC. The Company is the first to integrate all the drive and protection components along with the GaN transistor in a single GaN chip. This provides several form-factor improvements and energy savings compared to silicon solutions. The GaN IC solution also provides several benefits compared to GaN discrete solutions, including a smaller footprint, fewer components, energy savings, and lower cost.
Based on third-party and our internal estimates, the GaN device market in 2020 was about $20 million of total sales, and is estimated to more than double every year through 2026 to $2.1 billion (117% CAGR), while the total power semiconductor market is expected to grow at a more modest 6% CAGR during the same time. This growth represents an opportunity for GaN and for Navitas, as we believe we are a clear leader in the GaN space. Further, this estimated $2.1 billion market represents only 16% of a total $13.1 billion power semiconductor market in 2026, based on Yole estimates and external research, with more room to grow in the outer years. 
Company Overview
Converting power efficiently has emerged as a critical challenge as the electrification of our planet continues amid pursuit of a reduced carbon footprint. Electric vehicles, renewable energy, large-scale data processing and other applications all demand power and charging infrastructures with greater speed and efficiency than status-quo silicon technology. Navitas’ integrated circuits solve complex and demanding challenges that are inherent in power conversion by unlocking both speed and efficiency. Since our founding in 2013, we have successfully harnessed the fundamentally superior material properties of GaN to enable cost savings and enhanced power conversion through product integration, reducing the amount of space needed to support multiple requirements while dramatically increasing charging speeds.With ten times stronger electrical fields and twice the electron mobility compared to silicon, GaN is ideally suited for disrupting power switching applications, but challenges around manufacturing quality and reliability make commercialization difficult. By developing a fully qualified manufacturing process with over one billion device hours tested, Navitas has overcome these key hurdles 
to successfully and reliably integrate the critical drive, control and protection circuits into a single chip, enabling mainstream GaN adoption and unlocking the full potential of GaN in speed, efficiency, simplicity and cost. Navitas estimates show that GaN-based power systems can provide 20x faster switching, up to 3x higher power density, 3x faster charging, up to 40% energy savings and are 3x smaller and lighter compared to silicon-based power systems.Navitas’ best-in-class ICs allow end customers to implement GaN technology with a simple, dependable solution to realize groundbreaking power density and efficiency. We are developing a differentiated GaN power IC platform utilizing decades of power semiconductor technical expertise, robust applications knowledge and strong end customer relationships. We believe our competitive strengths and robust IP portfolio of over 145 issued and pending patents have enabled us to establish a leading market position in GaN power semiconductors.
Navitas is led by a team of tenured power semiconductor industry experts with a combined 300+ years of experience in semiconductor materials, devices, applications, systems and marketing and over $4B/year in power semiconductor revenue generated in their careers.
Navitas’ Market Opportunities
We believe GaN is positioned to displace silicon-based power semiconductors in mobile, consumer, enterprise / data center, renewables / solar and electric vehicle (EV) applications. These five markets are driven by two major, long-term secular trends. Mobile, consumer, and enterprise are driven by increased demand for connectivity. With additional connectivity comes explosive data growth, which translates to explosive growth in power demand. GaN addresses this power and energy consumption problem, further enabling these industries to reach their true potential. The second long-term secular trend is climate change. Electrifying end applications, like electric transportation and electric vehicles, leads to more sustainable technologies. Renewable energy sources, particularly solar, are expected to adopt GaN in order to gain significant cost improvements and to save energy. We are currently shipping products for consumer and mobile applications, and we expect to achieve progress towards shipments in our other targeted sectors in the future.
•Mobile. Our primary focus in the mobile segment is mobile chargers. Mobile chargers are a fast-growing, high-volume market providing a platform to demonstrate that our GaN Power ICs are ready for high-volume commercial adoption and are able to solve real end-equipment challenges at attractive prices. Today, the mobile charger end-market faces a big power problem as the devices they power feature increasingly larger screens, bigger batteries, faster processors, and increased data requirements. All of these trends require additional energy. Traditional silicon chargers can take up to three or four hours to fully charge a phone, tablet or laptop. GaN Power ICs can provide up to 3x more power and up to 3x faster charging, with half the size and weight of silicon chargers. With over 2.5 billion wall chargers shipped every year, with approximately $1 of GaN bill of materials (“BoM”) content per charger, the mobile charger market represents a multi-billion-dollar opportunity based on estimates from IDC PC tracker, USB-C research, Yole research and Navitas estimates.
•Consumer. The consumer market represents consumer electronics that are not mobile and not battery operated, but are connected to the internet. With explosive data growth comes explosive power growth. Our GaN devices can deliver this high power in much smaller form factors compared to silicon. This is very important in a number of consumer applications like ultra-thin TVs, high-powered gaming systems, desktop all-in-one PCs, or various smart home internet connected devices. In 2022 these four sectors are expected to aggregate about 600 million systems shipped per year, and typically use about $3 of GaN content per system. This represents another $2 billion opportunity based on estimates from Gartner, Pulsenews, WitsView, Statista and Navitas estimates.
•Data Center Within the enterprise end-market, we primarily focus on solving power problems of data centers. Nearly 50% of the total cost of ownership of a data center is related to power, which includes cost of power supplies as well as the cost of electricity for data processing, cooling, lighting and other power needs. For the data processing component alone, by our estimates, a silicon-based data center today is about 75% efficient. This implies that 25% of the energy used by data center computing and storage equipment is wasted as heat and never used for data processing. A GaN-based data center can improve efficiency to about 84% total efficiency. This represents a benefit in the form of reducing the cost of electricity and the cost of cooling. Based on our analysis, approximately $1.9 billion in electricity could be saved each year if all data centers moved to GaN. Our products also reduce the required footprint, which means less of the data center footprint is needed for power processing and more can be applied to data processing. In aggregate, data centers represent about a $1 billion opportunity for GaN ICs based on IDC Worldwide Quarterly Server Tracker and Navitas analysis. There is a similar market need in the cryptocurrency mining space, which has a high demand for energy.
•Solar. Navitas is also well positioned to drive GaN adoption in solar applications. As we reduce the inverter hardware costs of the power supply using GaN ICs, we also significantly improve the energy savings over time. We estimate this translates into about a 10% improvement to the return on investment in solar systems. Overall, we estimate the GaN IC opportunity for solar applications to be over $1 billion per year based on Markets and Markets Micro-Inverter Market report and Navitas analysis.
•Electric Vehicles. Electric Vehicles (EV) represent the largest market that GaN can address. There are three different use-cases for GaN Power ICs in an electric vehicle, namely the on-board charger to charge the high-voltage battery, the DC-to-DC converter to convert the power from the high-voltage battery for use in all the other electronics in the car, and the traction drive or motor control for driving the electric motor of the vehicle. The broader challenges to the adoption of EVs generally include three main themes: the need for faster charging, demand for extended range, and lowering the cost compared to traditional, internal combustion powered cars. GaN can help in all three areas. In addition to faster charging time, GaN devices can significantly improve energy savings (power dissipation), which ultimately translates into lower battery cost for the same driving range, or a longer driving range for the same battery cost. We estimate this represents a $2.5 billion annual GaN Power IC opportunity in 2030 based on BCG research, Yole research and Navitas estimates. This estimate excludes other forms of electric transportation such as e-bikes, scooters, motorbikes and other transportation innovations.
Competitive Strengths
In July 2021, we analyzed publicly announced or available GaN chargers and found a total of 143 such chargers using our GaN ICs, greater than all other GaN suppliers combined (i.e., up to 98 GaN chargers did not use Navitas GaN ICs). In May 2021, we performed a separate analysis of publicly announced or available GaN technologies from all other suppliers with voltage ratings great than 300V, which confirmed that none of these offered any power transistors that are monolithically integrated with other analog or logic circuits other than simple diode-connected gate protection transistors. As of December 2021, the number of mass production chargers that include Navitas GaN ICs had risen to over 170, with another 240 in development. Based on the foregoing, we believe we have achieved a market-leading position in GaN power ICs. We believe we have done this by surmounting key challenges to commercialization, resulting in best-in-class GaN IC solutions and a patented, multi-year advantage. We believe our key competitive advantages include:
•Industry-Leading IP Position and Proprietary Design Support. Navitas has developed a broad and highly defensible portfolio of over 145 patents issued or pending that encompass critical aspects of GaN power circuitry as well as analog and digital integration.

Intellectual Property
The core strength of our business lies in our industry-leading IP position in GaN power ICs. We invented the first commercial GaN power ICs and along the way have patented many fundamental circuit elements which are needed in most power systems from 10 W to 100 kW. We have more than 145 issued or pending patents, which are expected to expire between the end of 2034 and February of 2041. Over the past several years, we have invented, characterized, modeled, and simulated the optimum way to produce GaN power ICs.
In addition to our comprehensive patent portfolio, our most important trade secret is our process design kit (PDK) used to create new GaN-based devices and circuits. Our mature and comprehensive GaN IC PDK consists of technology files, devices, characterization results and models, circuits, verification tools for design rules, layout vs. schematic, layout parameter extraction, and fully enabled top-level circuit simulation and test benches. These various processes together help us create our proprietary GaN ICs. Our GaN power IC inventions and intellectual property translate across all of our target markets from mobile, consumer, EV, enterprise, and renewables.
Competition
Use of GaN semiconductor technology in power applications is still at the early stage of the adoption curve and requires many years of research and patented technology to achieve cost effective, high-yield manufacturability without reliability issues.
Our competitors include suppliers of silicon-based and GaN-based power semiconductors. Most suppliers of GaN-based devices today offer discrete (i.e., non-integrated) GaN solutions, which require silicon-based and other components for drive, control and protection. These solutions, even though they offer some benefits compared to silicon, still do not 
capture all the advantages of a GaN integrated power IC that Navitas provides. Our primary GaN competitors include Infineon Technologies AG, GaN Systems, Inc., Power Integrations, Inc., Texas Instruments Incorporated, Innoscience, Transphorm, Inc. and Efficient Power Conversion Corporation (EPC).
Our primary silicon-based power semiconductor competitors include Infineon, STMicroelectronics International N.V., ON Semiconductor Corporation (onsemi) and Power Integrations, among others. Silicon-based power devices are still the incumbent solutions used for power applications and currently have a lower-cost advantage. However, given the speed, power and size advantages of an integrated GaN IC over a silicon solution, coupled with expected cost reductions, we expect to cross the cost-parity point with silicon and achieve GaN-based power systems that are lower cost than their silicon counterparts by the end of 2023.
While Navitas believes system cost parity for GaN-based mobile chargers in excess of 30W will reach system cost parity within the next two years (i.e., during 2023) compared to silicon-based chargers, there are inherent risks that such cost parity may not be achieved. Those risks include:
•GaN wafer and assembly (packaging) prices may not be reduced by suppliers as fast as expected or committed, especially if global semiconductor shortages continue throughout 2022 and into 2023.
•GaN manufacturing yields, while demonstrated over 90% on a stable, multi-month basis, could deteriorate causing manufacturing costs of GaN IC to increase.
•The cost of silicon controllers, which are an important complement to GaN power ICs used in all mobile chargers, is expected to decrease, but price increases could occur, especially if global semiconductor shortages continue throughout 2022 and into 2023, and such costs are not directly controlled by Navitas.
•Passive and mechanical components (inductors, transformers, capacitors, printed circuit boards (PCBs), plastic housings, and others) are an important complement to GaN power ICs used in all mobile chargers and contribute to cost reduction as they generally decrease in size, weight and cost as GaN increases charger switching frequency compared to silicon-based chargers. Although we expect these cost reductions for passive and mechanical components to continue, it is possible that they will not materialize as expected, and such costs are not directly controlled by Navitas.
Some of the above-mentioned risk factors are associated with the shortage in the semiconductor industry which we expect will last through 2022 or 2023. However, it is also likely that corresponding components in silicon-based chargers will increase in cost independent of the shortages, allowing GaN-based chargers to still achieve the forecasted system cost parity in 2023 on a relative basis.
Manufacturability
We utilize a fabless business model, working with third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our products.
Navitas devices are fabricated in a layer of GaN sitting on a silicon substrate (known as “GaN-on-Si”). This combination traditionally posed several challenges due to physical dissimilarities in the materials and resulting defect densities, which translated into poor manufacturing, low yields, high costs, and poor reliability. We have spent a significant amount of our history working to solve these problems through process and design improvements and test methods. As a result of these efforts, we have achieved stable, predictable, and consistent yields of well over 90%. 
Gallium is produced primarily as a byproduct from the production of bauxite, the chief ore of aluminum. 2017 world production capacity is estimated at over 1,000 tons (low-grade and refined), and is estimated to be growing at about 15% per year, with a supply potential of over 2,000 tons sourced from many countries. Semiconductor applications dominate the commercial demand for gallium, representing 98% of its use, which includes microwave circuits, ultra high-speed logic chips, LEDs, laser diodes and, as is the case for Navitas GaN power ICs, in power electronics. Gallium is not considered a rare or precious metal. GaN power ICs typically use only 95ug of Gallium in the manufacture of a single GaN power IC. We expect Navitas will consume less than .01% of the 2,000 tons estimated annual supply potential by 2026.
Our wafer fab partner since inception has been Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). We have worked to co‑develop GaN-based product manufacturing capabilities with TSMC, which has invested significant capital to develop this capability. Although we have no volume-contracted commitments with TSMC, and work on the basis of purchase orders, our volumes of GaN products in TSMC wafer fabs are critical to the utilization and efficiency of TSMC’s GaN-specific infrastructure. TSMC operates as a leading global supplier, with significant capacity to meet our growth needs. Our process is compatible with multiple complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (“CMOS”) foundries with the addition of a small number of GaN-specific process modules.
Research & Development
Navitas has invested its time and effort to carefully develop its proprietary GaN IC chips for power electronics and semiconductor applications. Our experienced teams around the world have made GaN adoption a reality as many end customers in different end markets start to realize the true potential of our GaN power ICs. In order to protect our market leadership in GaN ICs, we continually look to innovate and improve our GaN ICs, to achieve greater efficiency, integration and speed at lower costs. We evaluate various complementary technologies, look to improve our PDK and hope to keep introducing newer generations of GaN technology. Navitas’ research and development activities are located primarily in the U.S., China and Taiwan.
Sustainability
We believe we are the first company to publish a sustainability report that comprehensively quantifies the positive impact of GaN power semiconductors on climate change based on global standards. Our report includes a third-party Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) of GaN technology according to ISO14040/14044, the international standard for assessing environmental impacts throughout a product’s life cycle—from raw material acquisition through production, use, end-of-life treatment, recycling and final disposal. The Navitas report also quantifies corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts through 3rd party assessments. We estimate that each GaN power IC shipped saves a net 4 kg of CO2 emissions, and overall GaN is estimated to save an aggregate of 2.6 Gtons of CO2 emissions per year by 2050.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, our worldwide workforce consisted of 162 full and part-time employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
