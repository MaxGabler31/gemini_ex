ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OUR COMPANY
Cabot Microelectronics Corporation ("Cabot Microelectronics'', "the Company'', "us'', "we'', or "our''), which was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1999, is a leading global supplier of consumable materials to semiconductor manufacturers and pipeline and adjacent industry customers. On November 15, 2018 (“Acquisition Date”), we completed our acquisition of KMG Chemicals, Inc. (“KMG”), which produces and distributes specialty chemicals and performance materials for the semiconductor industry, pipeline and adjacent industries, and industrial wood preservation industry (“Acquisition”). The Acquisition extended and strengthened our position as one of the leading suppliers of consumable materials to the semiconductor industry and expanded our portfolio with the addition of KMG’s electronic chemicals and performance materials businesses, the latter of which we believe enables us to be a leading global provider of performance products and services to customers in pipeline and adjacent industries. 
Subsequent to the Acquisition, we have operated our business within two reportable segments: Electronic Materials and Performance Materials. The Electronic Materials segment consists of our heritage chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) slurries and polishing pads businesses, as well as the KMG’s heritage electronic chemicals business. In our Electronic Materials segment, we serve customers in the semiconductor industry across the United States, Europe and Asia, and are the leading global supplier of CMP slurries, and a leading global supplier of electronic chemicals (also known as “high-purity process chemicals”), and CMP pads. We develop, produce, and sell CMP slurries for polishing many of the conducting, insulating and isolating materials used in integrated circuit (IC) devices, and for polishing the disk substrates and magnetic heads used in hard disk drives. We also develop, manufacture, and sell CMP polishing pads, which are used in conjunction with slurries in the CMP process. In our electronic chemicals business, we produce and sell high-purity process chemicals through the formulation, purification, and blending of acids, solvents, and other wet chemicals used to etch and clean silicon wafers in the production of semiconductors, photovoltaics (solar cells), and flat panel displays. 
Our Performance Materials segment includes KMG’s heritage pipeline performance and wood treatment businesses, and our heritage QED business. We are a leading global provider of products, services, and solutions for optimizing pipeline throughput and maximizing performance and safety. Our pipeline performance products include drag-reducing agents (“DRAs”), valve lubricants, cleaners and sealants, and related equipment supporting pipeline and adjacent industries. We also provide routine and emergency maintenance services as well as training for customers in the pipeline and adjacent industries worldwide. Through KMG’s subsidiary, KMG-Bernuth, Inc. (KMG-Bernuth), we manufacture and sell our wood treatment preservatives, based on pentachlorophenol (“penta”), to wood treatment customers who use these products to extend the useful life of wood utility poles and crossarms, but we recently have announced that we intend to no longer invest in this business and will not construct a new consolidated manufacturing facility when we close the two existing facilities by the end of 2021. See below, and Note 10 of “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In our QED business, we serve the precision optics industry with capital equipment, consumables and services. For additional information on our segment reporting, refer to Note 22 of “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
ELECTRONIC MATERIALS: 
IC DEVICE MANUFACTURING
IC devices, or "chips", are components in a wide range of electronic systems for computing, communications, manufacturing and transportation. Consumers most frequently encounter IC devices in mobile internet devices (MIDs) such as smart phones and tablets, microprocessors, application processors and memory chips in their desktop or laptop computers, and in automotive applications, gaming devices, and digital televisions. The multi-step manufacturing process for IC devices typically begins with a circular wafer of pure silicon, with the first manufacturing step referred to as a "wafer start". Many identical IC devices, or dies, are manufactured on each wafer at the same time. The initial steps in the manufacturing process build transistors and other electronic components on the silicon wafer. These components are isolated from each other using a layer of insulating material, most often silicon dioxide, to prevent electrical signals from bridging from one transistor to another. These components are then wired together using conducting materials such as aluminum or copper in a particular sequence to produce a functional IC device with specific characteristics. Once the conducting wiring on one layer of the IC device is completed, another layer of insulating material is added. The process of alternating insulating and conducting layers is repeated until the desired wiring within the IC device is achieved. At the end of the process, the wafer is cut into the individual dies, which are then packaged to form individual chips.

CMP SLURRIES AND PADS
Demand for CMP consumables products, including slurries and pads, used in the production of IC devices is primarily based on the number of wafer starts by semiconductor manufacturers and the type and complexity of the IC devices they produce. To enhance the performance of IC devices, IC device manufacturers have progressively increased the number and density of electronic components and wiring layers in each IC device. This is typically done in conjunction with shrinking the key dimensions on an IC device from one technology generation, or "node," to another. As a result, the number of transistors, wires and discrete wiring layers have increased, increasing the complexity of the IC device and the related demand for CMP consumables products. Furthermore, as semiconductor technology has advanced and performance requirements of IC devices have increased, the percentage of IC devices that utilize CMP in the manufacturing process has increased steadily over time. We believe that CMP is used in most IC devices made today, and we expect that the use of CMP will continue to increase in the future.
In the CMP polishing process, CMP consumables are used to remove excess material that is deposited during the IC manufacturing process, and to level and smooth the surfaces of the layers of IC devices, via a combination of chemical reactions and mechanical abrasion, leaving minimal residue and defects on the surface, with only the material necessary for circuit integrity remaining. CMP slurries are liquid solutions generally composed of high-purity deionized water and a proprietary mix of chemical additives and engineered abrasives that chemically and mechanically interact at an atomic level with the surface material on the wafer. CMP pads are engineered polymeric materials designed to distribute and transport the slurry to the surface of the wafer and distribute it evenly across the wafer. Grooves are formed into the surface of the pad to facilitate distribution of the slurry. The CMP process is performed on a CMP polishing tool. During the CMP process, the wafer is held on a rotating carrier, which is pressed down against a CMP pad. The CMP pad is attached to a rotating polishing table that spins in a circular motion in the opposite direction from the rotating wafer carrier. A CMP slurry is continuously applied to the polishing pad to facilitate and enhance the polishing process. Hard disk drive and silicon wafer manufacturers use similar processes to smooth the surface of substrate disks.
An effective CMP process is achieved through technical optimization of the CMP consumables in conjunction with an appropriately designed CMP process. Prior to introducing new or different CMP slurries or pads into its manufacturing process, an IC device manufacturer generally requires the product to be qualified in its processes through an extensive series of tests and evaluations. These qualifications are intended to confirm that the CMP consumable product will function properly within the customer's overall manufacturing process. These tests and evaluations may require minor changes to the CMP process or the CMP slurry or pad. While this qualification process varies depending on numerous factors, it is generally quite costly and may take six months or longer to complete. IC device manufacturers usually assess the cost, time required, and impact on production when they consider implementing or switching to a new CMP slurry or pad.
CMP enables IC device manufacturers to produce smaller, faster and more complex IC devices with a greater density of transistors and other electronic components. With smaller IC devices, IC device manufacturers can increase the number of IC devices that fit on a wafer, which increases their throughput, or the number of IC devices that can be manufactured in a given time period. CMP also helps reduce the number of defective or substandard IC devices produced, which increases the device yield. Producing more complex and higher performing IC devices increases the value of the wafers processed. Improvements in throughput, yield and value per wafer improve the return on an IC device manufacturer's significant investment in manufacturing capacity, which is a high priority. More broadly, sustained growth in the semiconductor industry traditionally has been fueled by enhanced performance and lower unit costs, making IC devices more affordable in an expanding range of applications. We believe CMP remains a critical process in leading-edge semiconductor technology, enabling IC device manufacturers to efficiently produce complex chips, particularly where higher performance may now be accompanied by higher unit costs.
ELECTRONIC CHEMICALS
Through our electronic chemicals business, we formulate, purify and blend acids, solvents and other wet chemicals used to etch and clean silicon wafers in the production of semiconductors, photovoltaics (solar cells) and flat panel displays. Our products include sulfuric, phosphoric, nitric and hydrofluoric acids, ammonium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, isopropyl alcohol, other specialty organic solvents and various blends of chemicals. Our customers rely on us to provide products with very low levels of contaminants and particles. We purchase raw material chemicals from various suppliers and at our facilities blend, purify and package them for distribution to our customers. We are responsible for product purity levels and analytical testing, and in our view, our ability to maintain high purity levels throughout the supply chain process is a competitive advantage. We believe the production of high-purity process chemicals is critical to our customers’ businesses, as they demand an increasing level of purity to enable more advanced technology nodes and increase yields. We believe demand for electronic chemicals will continue to increase as the semiconductor industry migrates to smaller nodes, which require additional processing steps. 
INDEX

PERFORMANCE MATERIALS:
PIPELINE PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS; DRAG REDUCING AGENTS ("DRAs")
Through the Acquisition, we acquired KMG’s pipeline performance business, which has enabled us to become a leading global provider of performance products and services to pipeline companies. Through this business, we supply DRAs, valve lubricants, cleaners and sealants, and related services and equipment, including routine and emergency valve maintenance services and training, to customers in the pipeline and adjacent industries. Our pipeline performance products and services provide value-added specialty products that optimize pipeline efficiency, lower operating costs, and enhance safety. Through the Acquisition, we acquired KMG’s pipeline performance business, which includes the DRA business operated through Flowchem LLC (“Flowchem”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of KMG, as well the valve lubricants and related services businesses. We operate facilities for the manufacture, formulation and distribution of our pipeline performance products in the United States and Canada. We believe demand for DRAs is driven by both production levels within current pipeline infrastructure, as well as future additional pipeline capacity coming online. In our view, aging of existing pipeline infrastructure should create additional demand, as DRAs allow pipeline customers to maximize throughput while meeting maximum pipeline pressure regulations.
WOOD TREATMENT
In the wood treatment preservatives business, KMG-Bernuth supplies penta to industrial customers who use this preservative to pressure treat wood products, primarily utility poles and crossarms, to extend their useful life by protecting against insect damage and decay. Early in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we had announced that, as a result of the Mexican government’s required compliance with certain international environmental regulations and the resulting requirement that KMG-Bernuth cease producing penta in Mexico by the end of 2021, we planned to close both the Matamoros, Mexico and Tuscaloosa, Alabama facilities by such time, with the intention to consolidate operations in a new plant. However, later in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as we assessed our capital expenditure priorities for fiscal year 2020 and beyond, we made a decision to further focus our future capital investments on our high-growth core businesses, such as pipeline performance products, CMP slurries and pads and electronic chemicals. As a result, we also decided to cease future investment in the wood treatment business and to not construct a new production facility to replace current operations in Matamoros and Tuscaloosa. In the interim, prior to the closure of the Matamoros and Tuscaloosa facilities, we intend to continue to operate the existing facilities and provide our customers with quality penta products to treat and extend the useful life of wood utility poles and crossarms. We are considering various options regarding this business. See Note 9 and Note 10 of “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
PRECISION OPTICS
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, QED Technologies International, Inc. (QED), is a leading provider of deterministic finishing and advanced measurement technology for the precision optics industry. Many of the production processes currently used in precision machining and polishing have been based on traditional, labor-intensive techniques, which are being replaced by computer-controlled, deterministic processes. Through our QED subsidiary, we are applying our technical expertise in polishing techniques to demanding applications in other industries where shaping, enabling, and enhancing the performance of surfaces is critical to success, such as for precision optics. We believe precision optics are pervasive, serving several large existing industries such as semiconductor equipment, aerospace, defense, biomedical, research and digital imaging.

OUR PRODUCTS
ELECTRONIC MATERIALS 
CMP CONSUMABLES FOR IC DEVICES AND FOR SUBSTRATE MATERIALS
We develop, produce and sell CMP slurries for polishing a wide range of materials that conduct electrical signals, including tungsten, copper, tantalum (commonly referred to as "barrier"), which is used in copper wiring applications, and aluminum. Slurries for polishing tungsten are used in essentially all chip manufacturing processes containing CMP, with growth driven by increased utilization and higher performance demands in advanced logic, DRAM and 3D NAND devices. Tungsten slurries are also used in advanced logic devices for a multitude of end use applications including MIDs such as smart phones and tablets, gaming devices, and in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence, as well as in legacy logic applications such as those used in automobiles and connected communication devices. In addition, Tungsten slurries are also used in some of the most advanced technologies, such as 3D memory and FinFET for advanced logic IC devices. Slurries for polishing copper and barrier materials are used in the production of advanced IC logic devices such as microprocessors for computers, and devices for graphic systems, gaming systems and communication devices, as well as in the production of advanced memory devices. These products include different slurries for polishing the copper film and the thin barrier layer used to separate copper from the adjacent insulating material. Slurries for polishing aluminum are used in certain advanced transistor gate structures. We offer multiple products for each technology node to enable different integration schemes depending on specific customer needs.
We also develop, manufacture and sell slurry products used to polish the dielectric insulating materials that separate conductive layers within logic and memory IC devices. Some of our slurry products for these materials are used in mature, high volume polishing applications called Interlayer Dielectric, or ILD, in the production of both logic and memory devices. Our more advanced dielectrics products are designed to deliver higher throughput, improved defectivity, and lower cost of ownership than required in traditional ILD applications, as well as to meet the more stringent and complex performance requirements of lower-volume, more specialized dielectrics polishing applications at advanced technology nodes. Some of the applications for advanced dielectrics slurries include shallow trench isolation (STI), "stop on poly" or "stop on nitride" isolation, bulk oxide polishing, and polishing of various dielectrics in advanced transistor designs.
We develop, produce and sell CMP polishing pads, which are consumable materials that work in conjunction with CMP slurries in the CMP polishing process. We believe that CMP polishing pads represent a natural adjacency to our CMP slurry business, since both technologies are required by our customers to deliver their intended result and utilize the same technical and sales infrastructure. Our polishing pad product portfolio includes pads utilizing both thermoset and thermoplastic polyurethane pad material. We produce and sell pads that can be used on a variety of polishing tools, over a range of applications, including tungsten, copper, and dielectrics, over a range of technology nodes, and on both 300mm and 200mm wafers.
In addition, we develop, produce and sell CMP slurries for polishing certain substrate related materials that are used in the production of hard disks and IC devices used in various electronics applications, which represent an extension of our core CMP slurry technology and manufacturing capabilities established for the semiconductor industry. We believe CMP significantly improves the surface finish of these substrates, resulting in better performance, such as greater storage capacity, higher speed or better power efficiency, of electronics and their applications.
ELECTRONIC CHEMICALS PRODUCTS FOR IC DEVICES AND FOR SUBSTRATE MATERIALS
Our electronic chemicals products include sulfuric, phosphoric, nitric and hydrofluoric acids, ammonium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, isopropyl alcohol, other specialty organic solvents and various blends of chemicals. These products are used in multiple process steps throughout the semiconductor fab. Customers demand an increasing level of purity to enable more advanced technology nodes and increase yields. Our electronic chemicals products currently have purity levels up to 20 parts per trillion levels.

INDUSTRY TRENDS
SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY
We believe the semiconductor industry continues to exhibit various trends. Demand within the semiconductor industry is driven by MIDs, personal computers (PCs), and a wide range of other electronic applications including high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. The semiconductor industry has shown fluctuation in the overall industry demand, as a result of numerous factors, including changing mix of demand drivers, semiconductor fab utilization, pressure to reduce costs, and slower pace of technology advancement.
We have discussed the significant shift in semiconductor industry demand over the past several years from IC devices for PCs to MIDs. Demand for MIDs is largely consumer-based, versus more enterprise-based demand for PCs, and this shift introduced fluctuations in semiconductor industry demand, along with various macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. There are several factors that could drive future industry growth, such as the: ongoing transition from traditional planar, or 2D, memory to advanced 3D memory for mobile, server, and PC applications; expected need for advanced semiconductor devices for high performance computing, virtual and augmented reality, smart phone applications, artificial intelligence, and 5G; demand for greater connectivity with wearables, peripherals, and the internet of things; increased semiconductor content in automobiles; and semiconductor industry development in China. While demand conditions may fluctuate, and periodically be softer, which we experienced in fiscal year 2019, we continue to believe that semiconductor industry demand will grow over the long term based on increased usage of IC devices in existing applications, as well as future applications.
Over the past several years, we have seen the customer base within the semiconductor industry consolidate as larger semiconductor manufacturers have generally grown faster than smaller ones, through mergers and acquisitions as well as through alliances among and between different companies. Costs to achieve the required scale in manufacturing within the semiconductor industry continue to rise, along with the related costs of research and development, and larger manufacturers generally have greater access to the resources necessary to manage their businesses. This trend is particularly evident in capital spending within the industry, as the largest semiconductor companies account for an increasingly large portion of total capital spending in the industry compared to the past.
As demand for more advanced and lower cost electronic devices grows, there is continued pressure on IC device manufacturers to reduce their costs. Many manufacturers reduce costs by pursuing ever-increasing scale in their operations, while seeking to reduce their production costs by increasing their production yields, regardless of their scale. Thus, they look for electronic materials products, such as CMP consumables and electronic chemicals products, with quality and performance attributes that can help them reduce their overall cost of ownership, pursue ways to use smaller amounts of CMP materials, and aggressively pursue price reductions for these materials. Electronic chemicals products also require increased levels of purity and, like CMP consumables products, lower levels of variation, which contributes to our pursuit of cutting-edge metrology methods to measure purity levels achieved.
Manufacturers also have historically reduced cost, and simultaneously improved device performance, by migrating to smaller technology nodes. However, as the industry continues to shrink dimensions, leading edge technology node transitions are becoming more challenging due to technical and physical obstacles, and the pace of technology change has slowed. To achieve performance and cost improvements, semiconductor manufacturers are placing greater emphasis on new device architectures, including 3D memory and FinFET. Industry commentary suggests that approximately two-thirds of the NAND market has been converted to 3D memory, and while the industry transition is almost complete, we expect additional incremental volume in the memory area associated with more vertical layers. In addition, while during our fiscal 2019 the semiconductor industry experienced weakness in overall DRAM and NAND demand that led to what we believe is a short-term reduction in wafer starts, industry expectations remain that overall demand for these devices, and the related need for increased wafer starts, should continue in the coming years. We believe semiconductor manufacturers will continue to depend upon highly engineered materials in these new architectures, requiring innovative CMP solutions. Further, as wafer starts and the subsequent number of processing steps used on each wafer continue to grow, we see the demand for our high purity electronic chemicals products as also likely to increase.
INDEX

ELECTRONIC MATERIALS DEMAND
Demand for our CMP consumables and electronic chemicals products is primarily driven by wafer starts, so the electronic materials sector reflects semiconductor industry demand patterns in terms of growth, cyclicality and seasonality and varying demand for specific device types. Consistent with other participants in the semiconductor industry, we have experienced relatively soft demand conditions in the semiconductor industry starting in our second fiscal quarter of 2019 and continuing past the end of the fiscal year, although some signs of stabilization are becoming apparent. Over the long term, we anticipate worldwide demand for CMP consumables and electronic chemicals used by IC device manufacturers will grow as a result of expected long-term growth in wafer starts, and the trend to more advanced technologies. With respect to CMP consumables, we believe there will continue to be an associated increase in the number of CMP polishing steps required to produce these advanced devices, and the introduction of new materials that are expected to require CMP. With respect to electronic chemicals, we believe there will be increasing demand as customers are requiring a higher level of purity, which requires an increasing number of processing steps used on each wafer. In addition, as customers introduce smaller technology nodes and new architectures, they require higher purity chemicals with fewer and fewer impurities.
We expect the anticipated long-term growth in demand will be partially mitigated by continued efficiency improvements in electronic materials usage as customers seek to reduce their costs. As discussed above, semiconductor manufacturers look for ways to lower the cost of CMP consumables and electronic chemicals in their production operations. As an example, for CMP consumables, these can include customer improvements in technology, dilution of slurry, use of concentrated slurry products, or reduction of slurry flow rate, to reduce the total amount of slurry used, and to extend pad life. In addition, CMP demand also depends upon the specific mix of IC device demand, since the intensity of CMP usage varies by IC device type.
We believe that CMP technical solutions are becoming more complex, with advanced technologies generally requiring greater customization of CMP slurry products by customer, tool set and process integration approach. As a result, we generally see customers selecting suppliers earlier in their development processes and maintaining preferred supplier relationships through production. Therefore, we believe that close collaboration with our customers early in the development cycle offers the best opportunity for optimal CMP solutions. We also believe that research and development programs with customers and suppliers continue to be vital to our success as we develop and commercialize innovative, high-performing and more cost-effective CMP solutions.
PERFORMANCE MATERIALS DEMAND 
Pipeline Products and Services 
Demand for our pipeline performance products and services may be impacted by changes in the utilities and/or oil and gas industries. Volatility in oil and natural gas prices may impact our customers’ activity levels, including production and spending on our pipeline products and services. Expectations about future prices and price volatility are important in determining future spending levels for customers of our pipeline performance products and services. Historically, worldwide oil and natural gas prices and markets have been volatile and may continue to be so in the future. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, increases in supplies from United States shale production, international political conditions, including uprisings and political unrest, sovereign debt crises, the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer demand due to economic growth in countries such as China, weather conditions, domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the health of international economic and credit markets, the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other state-controlled oil companies to agree upon and maintain oil price and production controls, and general economic conditions.
Wood Treatment
Demand for our wood treatment preservative products, which are used to treat and preserve wood from insect damage and decay, is driven by our customers’ demand for utility poles and railroad crossarms, which may be impacted by factors such as infrastructure improvement projects and weather-related events. See above and below, and Note 10 of “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, regarding our decision to cease future investment in the wood treatment business and to not construct a new production facility to replace operations in Matamoros and Tuscaloosa.
INDEX

Precision Optics
Demand for products produced by our QED subsidiary may be impacted by changes in the underlying industries that utilize precision optics, such as semiconductor equipment, aerospace, defense, research, biomedical and digital imaging. Since our primary QED business is the sale of capital equipment, our results may be directly affected by levels of capital spending in these industries. Historically, capital spending is very cyclical, and is impacted by several different factors. These factors include general macroeconomic conditions, government spending and policies, as well as industry-specific trends and dynamics.
COMPETITION
ELECTRONIC MATERIALS 
We compete in the semiconductor industry, which is characterized by advances in technology and demanding requirements for product quality and consistency, and lower cost of ownership. We face competition from other suppliers of electronic materials.  However, as to our CMP consumables business, we believe we are the world’s leading supplier of CMP slurries, and the second largest provider of CMP pads.  We believe we continue to be well-positioned to retain and grow our business, and that we have the experience, scale, capabilities and infrastructure that are required for success, as we continue to work closely with technology-leading customers in the semiconductor industry to meet their growing expectations as a trusted business partner.
Our CMP slurry competitors range from small companies that compete with a single product or in a single geographic region, to divisions of global companies with multiple lines of CMP products. In our view, we are the only CMP slurry supplier today that serves a broad range of customers by offering and supporting a full line of CMP slurry solutions for all major applications, with a proven track record of supplying these products globally in high volumes with the requisite high level of technical support services.
With respect to CMP polishing pads, a division of DowDuPont has held the leading position in this area for many years. Several other companies also participate in this area of the CMP consumables business. We believe that our distinctive portfolio of pad technology and products enables us to meet our customers' needs for improved defectivity, greater pad consistency, and longer pad life. In addition, we believe that our full array of polishing pads offerings enables us to better serve our customers on a global basis, including our performance-differentiated slurry and pad consumable sets.
As to electronic chemicals, there are various competitors with whom we compete in different regions. In North America, we believe that we have a significant leadership position, and our principal competitors include Honeywell, Kanto Corporation and Avantor. Outside of the United States, other providers in Europe are BASF, Technic and Honeywell, and in Asia, BASF and Kanto Corporation, among others. We believe our business in Europe is comparable to other providers, and other than in Singapore, at present we do not participate materially in the business in Asia.
PERFORMANCE MATERIALS
In our pipeline performance business, LiquidPower Specialty Products Inc. holds the leading position in DRAs, with Baker Hughes as the other primary provider. For our valve products and services, however, participants include numerous other businesses with none appearing to hold a leadership position. 
With respect to our wood treatment business, penta products are and must be registered prior to sale under United States law. See Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a condition to registration, any company wishing to manufacture and sell these products must provide substantial scientific research and testing data regarding the chemistry and toxicology of the products to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). This data must be generated by the applicant, or the applicant must purchase access to the information from other data providers. We believe that the cost of satisfying the data submission requirement serves as an impediment to the entry of new competitors, particularly those with lesser financial resources. While we have no reason to believe that the product registration requirement will be materially modified, we cannot give any assurances as to the effect of such a discontinuation or modification on our business or competitive position.
Our QED subsidiary operates in the precision optics industry. There are few direct competitors of QED and we believe its technology is unique and provides a competitive advantage to customers in the precision optics industry, which still relies heavily on traditional artisanal methods of fabrication.

CUSTOMERS, SALES, AND MARKETING
ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
Within the semiconductor industry, our customers are generally producers of logic or memory IC devices, or providers of IC foundry services. Some logic customers, and so-called "fabless" companies, outsource some or all the production of their devices to foundries, which provide contract manufacturing services, in order to avoid the high cost of process development, construction and operation of a fab, or to provide additional capacity when needed.
We believe the primary influences of our customers' electronic materials buying decisions are: overall cost of ownership, which represents the cost to purchase, use and maintain a product; product quality and consistency; product performance and its impact on a customer's overall yield; engineering support; and, supply assurance. We believe that greater customer expertise within the processes that utilize our CMP consumables and electronic chemicals, more challenging integration schemes, additional and unique polishing materials, and cost pressures will continue to increase demands on suppliers like us.
We use a collaborative approach to build close relationships with our customers in a variety of areas, and we have customer-focused teams in each major geographic region. Our sales process begins long before the actual sale of our products and occurs on numerous levels. Due to the long lead times from research and development to product commercialization and sales, we have research teams that collaborate with technology-leading customers on emerging applications years before the products are required by the market. For CMP consumables, we also have development teams that interact closely with these customers, using our research and development facilities and capabilities to design products tailored to their needs. Next, our applications engineers work with customers to integrate our products into their manufacturing processes. Finally, as part of our sales process, our logistics and sales personnel provide supply, warehouse and inventory management services for our customers, which is also the case for our electronic chemicals customers.
We market our CMP slurry and pad products primarily through direct sales to our customers, although we use distributors in certain areas. We believe this strategy of primarily direct sales provides us an additional means to collaborate with our customers and provides our customers with the most efficient means by which to procure our products.
For our electronic chemicals products, we market through a combination of an internal sales force and distributors organized by geographic region. 
PERFORMANCE MATERIALS
Pipeline Products and Services
Through our Flowchem subsidiary, we provide DRAs to several major mid-stream pipeline transmission companies both domestically and internationally. We have a U.S.-based and global sales team, a wholly-owned transportation and logistics company and a network of distributors and agents to manage the sales and delivery of our products. Our main marketing approach is through our membership in industry-based professional organizations, trade shows and publications.
In our Valve Products & Services business, we market and sell to pipeline and adjacent industry customers, such as service companies, and major utility distribution companies via direct sales and channel partners. We actively participate as industry experts in global industry trade shows and forums through technical presentations and white papers.
Wood Treatment
The principal wood preserving chemicals for industrial applications are penta, which is the base for our products, creosote and chromated copper arsenate, or CCA. We only supply penta to customers in the United States and Canada. We do not have other products or business. We are the only manufacturer of penta-based preservatives in North America. Penta is used primarily to treat electric, telephone and other utility poles, to protect them from insect damage and decay, thus extending their useful life by many years. We estimate that approximately two million treated wood utility poles are purchased each year by utility companies in the United States. Of that amount, we estimate approximately 50% are treated with penta. The remaining poles are treated primarily with creosote or CCA.

Precision Optics
Our QED subsidiary supports customers in the semiconductor equipment, aerospace, defense, research, biomedical, and digital imaging industries. QED counts among its worldwide customers leading precision optics manufacturers, major semiconductor original equipment manufacturers, research institutions, and contractors to the United States and other governments.
For additional information on our customers, refer to Note 2 of “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL
We believe that technology is vital to success in our businesses, primarily in the area of CMP consumables, and we plan to continue to devote significant resources to research, development and technical support (“R&D”), and balance our efforts between shorter and longer-term industry needs. Here, we focus our R&D efforts on product innovation at leading-edge applications for our technology-leading customers. We develop new and enhanced CMP solutions tailored to these customers' requirements using our expertise in chemical formulation, materials science, product engineering and manufacturing technology. We work closely with these customers at their facilities to identify their specific technology and manufacturing challenges and to translate these challenges into viable CMP process solutions.
Our Research, development and technical efforts are focused on the areas of research related to fundamental CMP technology; development of new and enhanced CMP consumables products, including collaboration on joint development projects with technology-leading customers and suppliers; process development to support rapid and effective commercialization of new products; technical support of our CMP products in our customers’ research, development and manufacturing facilities; and, development of polishing and metrology application outside of the semiconductor industry.
Our research in CMP slurries and pads addresses a breadth of complex and interrelated performance criteria that relate to the functional performance of IC devices, our customers' manufacturing yields, and their overall cost of ownership. We design slurries and pads that are capable of polishing one or more materials of differing hardness, sometimes at the same time, that comprise the semiconductor circuitry. In addition, our slurries and pads products must achieve the desired surface conditions at high polishing rates, high processing yields and low consumables costs in order to provide acceptable cost of ownership for our customers. Meanwhile, our electronic chemicals products are subject to increased high purity demand to enable more advanced technology nodes and increase yields. These market expectations require us to continue to develop industry leading metrology methods in order to measure the purity levels achieved. As technology advances and materials and designs increase in complexity, these challenges require significant investments in R&D.
We believe that our technology provides us with a competitive advantage, and that our investments in R&D provide us with polishing and metrology capabilities that support the most advanced and challenging customer technology requirements. 
Our global R&D team includes experts from the semiconductor industry and scientists from key disciplines required for the development of high-performance CMP consumable products. We operate an R&D facility in Aurora, Illinois, that features a Class 1 clean room and advanced equipment for product development, including 300mm polishing and metrology capabilities;; a facility in Taiwan that includes a clean room with 200mm polishing capability; a facility in South Korea that provides slurry formulation capability and 300mm polishing capability; and, an R&D laboratory in Singapore that provides polishing, metrology and slurry development capabilities for the data storage industry. We also operate R&D facilities in the United States, Europe, and Singapore pertaining to our electronic chemicals business. Our slurry, pads, and electronic chemicals facilities underscore our commitment to continuing to invest in our technology infrastructure to maintain our technology leadership and to be responsive to the needs of our customers.
For our pipeline performance products, in our Flowchem business, we employ several resources and facilities to perform research and development activities. We focus on both improving existing product performance as well as developing new products/technologies to serve our customers’ needs for DRAs.
We also commit R&D resources to our QED subsidiary. These activities are primarily focused on the development of new polishing and metrology capabilities, in support of our MRF and SSI product lines, as well as additional capabilities for our polishing services group. This work is done in our facilities in Rochester, New York.

RAW MATERIALS SUPPLY
Engineered abrasive particles are significant raw materials we use in many of our CMP slurries and pads. Our strategy is to secure various sources of different raw materials, as appropriate, to enable the desired performance of our products, and monitor those sources as necessary to provide supply assurance. Also, we have entered into multi-year supply agreements with several suppliers for the purchase of raw materials in the interest of supply assurance and to control costs. For additional information regarding these agreements, refer to "Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations", included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In our electronic chemicals business, we rely on a variety of suppliers for our raw materials, some of which we purchase on open account and others which we purchase under supply contracts. The number of suppliers is often limited, particularly as to the specific grade of raw material required by us to supply high purity products to our customers.
For both our pipeline performance products and our wood treatment products, we depend on outside suppliers for all the raw materials needed to produce our products and are subject to fluctuations in the price of those materials. We purchase raw materials for these businesses from a limited number of suppliers. Most of our QED subsidiary’s business relates to capital equipment, thus, there are minimal raw material supply issues that we face within this business unit.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We believe our intellectual property is important to our success and ability to compete, and we also differentiate our products and technology by their high quality and reliability, and our quality systems, global supply chain and logistics. As of October 31, 2019, we had 1,317 active worldwide patents, of which 284 United States patents, and 357 pending worldwide patent applications, of which 51 are in the United States. 
Many of these patents are important to our continued development of new and innovative products for CMP and related processes, as well as for new businesses. Our patents have a range of duration. We refresh our intellectual property on an ongoing basis through continued innovation. As an example, we have had patent coverage that was important to some of our legacy CMP slurry business and continue to have significant other patents that protect this technology and other legacy and advanced technology with a range of duration. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, use of certain manufacturing technologies, exclusive contractual arrangements with suppliers, and with employee and third party-nondisclosure and assignment agreements. We vigorously protect and defend our intellectual property and have been successful in this regard.
Most of our intellectual property has been developed internally, but we also may acquire intellectual property from others to enhance our intellectual property portfolio. These enhancements may be via licenses or assignments or we may acquire certain proprietary technology and intellectual property when we make acquisitions. We believe these technology rights can enhance our competitive advantage by providing us with future product development opportunities and expanding our intellectual property portfolio.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Our facilities and operations are subject to various environmental, safety, and human health laws and regulations, both at a federal and state or local level, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges, chemical manufacture and distribution, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, storage and disposal, and various other occupational safety and health matters. Governmental authorities can to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violators may be subject to civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, injunctions, or both. We believe that our facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our major operations in the United States, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom are certified under current ISO 14001 Environmental and OHSAS 18001 Safety and Health standards, which requires that we implement and operate according to various procedures that demonstrate waste reduction, energy conservation, injury reduction and other environmental, health and safety objectives. We have achieved certification under the revised ISO 14001 standards and are now actively pursuing certification under revised OHSAS 18001 standards that will transition to ISO 45001 standards over the next three years. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental, safety and health laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we do business, but we do not expect these costs will be material. See “Item, 1A. Risk Factors.”, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings”, and Note 20 of “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
INDEX

EMPLOYEES
We believe our employees are the foundation of our success. As of October 31, 2019, we employed 2,047 individuals, including 1,385 in operations, 249 in research and development and technical, 413 in sales, general and administration. In general, our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, but we do have some workers who are subject to such agreements, part of works councils, or similar arrangements, primarily in Europe, Mexico, Singapore. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS
We sell our products worldwide. We believe our geographic coverage allows us to utilize our business and technical expertise from a diverse, global workforce, strategically located in close proximity to our customers. As a result of the Acquisition, our geographic mix has changed. For example, in fiscal 2019, our North America revenue as a percentage of total revenue has increased from 13% to 36% compared to fiscal 2018. While approximately 50% of our global revenue is still being generated in Asia Pacific, our dependency on revenue from Asia Pacific has decreased as a result of the Acquisition. For more financial information about geographic areas, see Note 23 of “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
SEASONALITY
Our Electronic Materials business experiences some seasonality, mostly related to fluctuations in consumer demand for MID’s around the December and lunar new year holidays, and back to school periods, but over the past several years seasonality has appeared more muted, tempered by the broader array of factors affecting demand, such as 5G, Cloud computing, and AI. In our Performance Materials business, demand for our pipeline performance products such as DRAs appears to have some seasonality linked to weather, with demand for DRAs increasing in the colder months, yet demand from additional pipeline capacity coming online has made this less apparent. 
AVAILABLE INFORMATION
Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, definitive proxy statements on Schedule 14A, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, as well as any other filings with the SEC, are made available free of charge on our Company website, www.cabotcmp.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
