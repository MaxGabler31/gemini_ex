Business Development
 
The Yippi App is a messaging app with a focus on entertainment and security. It’s fast, simple, secure and free. Yippi seamlessly syncs a user’s normal messages and secret messages into one application. Users can send an unlimited number of messages, photos, and voice messages. Yippi groups allow users to send broadcasts to up to 100 contacts at a time. Users download the Yippi App through the Apple App Store, Google Play, or the Amazon App Store. Revenue is generated from selling advertising, emoji stickers, and special filters, effects and features for use with Yippi.
Yippi App Features
 
We have developed Yippi as the unique super app that empowers the user with numerous functionalities in a single complete app. The four main elements of the Yippi App are the marketplace, social media, ecosystem, and communication. Since July of 2017 there have been multiple versions launched which have incorporated all four elements.

5

Marketplace
 
We see the future in creating a robust ecosystem that is relevant and personalized for the user. Riding on the success of data commerce in large to small scale enterprising techno-preneurs, we are providing a social platform for any user to be involved in customizing their additional plug-ins of choice; from the utility add-ons, games, stickers, themes, skins or contents onto their Yippi social messaging app. This digital content makes up the Marketplace, where the user could obtain free or paid plug-ins from various vendors on a secure micro-transaction platform.
 
This self-sustaining ecosystem further completes and complements the whole Yippi social messaging app as the daily super app. We believe this concept opens up a whole new level of micro-transactions and a platform for creators to list their digital products and enhancements making them readily available for users.
 
With this Marketplace, instead of creating and owning every single item of intellectual property on our digital store, we are synergizing the creators and third-parties to create, list their items and engage in sharing of the digital products. This also sets in motion a micro-transaction, as creators could monetize their digital crafts, and diversify their revenue as Marketplace offers them another viable choice away from the existing digital markets.
 
Our API (Application Protocol Interface) is readily available for creators and third-parties to work on and test before the process of submission onto the Marketplace. This allows third party developers to develop applications that interface with the Yippi platform making the Marketplace a more robust destination for app users. This creates an atmosphere of community.
 
Additionally, physical products within the Marketplace are on a P2P and B2C basis with this feature embedded separately in Yippi Social, as the listing of products are easily available for users to peruse the marketplace to offer their wares. The Marketplace was launched in July 2017 and is in its initial usability stage. 
 
Wallet
 
Yippi has a host of shopping functions built-in, which provides access to a targeted Small to Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) in an ever-expanding variety of shopping experiences. Merchants range from official brand accounts to budding e-shopping enterprises; to cater to consumers via Yippi. As of July 31, 2018, our consumer directory, TPocket offers select brands of healthcare products, electronic goods, payment gateway for food & beverage establishments and services. All of these services are within the Yippi app.
 
In addition to our own shopping platform, there is a link to a 3rd-Party shopping platform in TA Mall as our partner, in giving value and choice of merchandise to the user. We do not expect to derive any income from TA Mall.
 
Furthermore, as the user spends, they receive points similar to cashback for them to use in another 3rd Party rewards program in Rewards Link. With their accumulated spending of their shopping goods or services; they receive points, redeemable at Rewards Link, all within the ecosystem of Yippi.
 
The Hotel & Flight (TogaGo) feature in Yippi boasts an impressive array of hotel, cruise, and flight partners that enable users to search for the best price for a dream holiday. Currently, prices are relatively cheaper and comparable to major travel applications in the market, and with this feature we have bridged these two different applications into one comprehensive application.
 
These extensions are developed and functioning and are bridged within Yippi with a link to the target platform while the user is still logged into their Yippi account.
 
Social Media
 
Yippi Social is fully developed and functioning and is the social media platform embedded within the Yippi social messaging app. Yippi Social incorporates a fully functioning social media timeline as a personal space with integrated functions such as: sharing of updates; following video channels; receiving event invitations; sharing photo and video links; joining groups of interests; and browsing an e-catalog of products.

6

 
Yippi Social enables users to share their content internally and externally via other platforms (social media or communication apps within their devices) in contrast to WeChat Moments’ or Facebook Timeline’s internal-only sharing capability.
 
A key feature is posting an update as a Live Moment. This provides the user a personal live streaming of contents to a user’s contacts and friends. This trendy feature is built into Yippi Social for the ultimate social media presence as the user has an avenue to broadcast their post in an engaging ‘live’ telecast to their viewers. We believe this unique selling point is in trend, as apparent with Facebook’s launch of similar feature in recent months.
 
Live Moment
 
We believe a Yippi user could apply many uses in this platform, and with the Live Moment feature, the user could use it as a tool to reach and engage their audience in a live-streaming technology as seen in the current trend of active Facebook users in using this tool to promote their items, share their events, or show their travels in a live setting with interactive responses from their fans and friends.
 
The veracity of live streaming by users is an advantage to us as we believe this adds another dimension to the overall experience. For example, for leisure a user could live stream their precious moments to their followers when they are celebrating a monumental occasion, or an e-marketer could Live Moment their products and services with an unboxing of their review or live Q&A session in engaging their audience. On a larger scale, with a company’s official account they could engage a sponsored Key Opinion Leader (“KOL”) in showcasing a Live Moment in reaching to wider organic reach. Live Moment was launched in July 2017.
 
Games
 
As with most social chat applications that have games bundled onto their app, Yippi has a plethora of simple yet addictive and fun games built in. There are 21 games for the user, with more anticipated to come in the coming months.
 
We are looking to acquire more games to add to the collection as well as to cater to a wider gaming audience in purchasing multi-player games, inclusive of tying-up partnerships with established game studios in marketing their games in-app in the same mold as WeChat as a platform for game developers to market their new releases as an exclusive pre-release title for popular MMO game Garena’s Arena of Valor.
 
A large share of gaming revenues are generated from mobile gaming. We believe our strategy of investing and partnering with up-and-coming developers will allow us to compete for additional revenue.
 
Through the Market Place, once fully launched, we will encourage more game studios or independent game producers to package and market their games via this separate platform within Yippi. We believe this would add another significant stream of revenue with its’ own micro-transactions (of free games’ enhancements/add-ons) and game purchases (paid games). As of July 2018, over 20 games were live within the Games section of the Yippi app.
 
Stickers
 
Since its release in July 2017, Yippi Stickers is currently functioning and has been packed with pre-loaded stickers that are suitable for any occasion, and these are well organized in their folders for the ease of execution.

7

 
We firmly believe with Stickers it opens up a whole new avenue for aspiring graphic designers to create and sell their artwork stickers on our Market Place.
 
A case study to note is the revenue-generating sticker pioneered by Line chat app, as they achieved tremendous success in generating revenue from their users through affordable e-stickers ever since its inception in 2010 and has steadily been a part of the corporation’s source of income; albeit with extensive competition from other chat apps’ introduction of their own stickers.
 
We believe Stickers may provide a profitable source of revenue, and we believe with our additional incentive of allowing talented users to trade their digital stickers on our associated Market Place platform, we are just at the tip of the iceberg in the vast potential of stickers in this generational boom.
 
We are committed in bringing the next evolution of Stickers and in bringing and providing creative creators to share in our technological advances. We are providing our APIs in sticker creations and development, with tutorials and market trends. This may include the next evolution of Motion Stickers, Animated GIFs and cinemographs with snippet of sound/voice and this would further differentiate and modernize all our Yippi Stickers in another level above major sticker competitors. In doing so, we believe we will be able to derive revenue from this this digital product.
 
Ecosystem
 
The Company presents the Yippi app to the market as a unique “Super App”, due to the fact that it provides numerous features that creates an ecosystem within the app.
 
The following components are currently under development and will add value and functionality as a full feature to the user, in all facets, namely: retail shopping & services (T Pocket), e-retail (TA Mall), and travel (Toga Go). While these functions are functioning as a third-party link within the Wallet section of the app, the direct usability is intended to be included in the version of app scheduled to be launched in June 2019.
 
The following have been developed and are currently functioning within the Yippi app: loyalty program (Rewards Link), news portal (Toga News), and games marketplace (Toga Games). The Company utilizes online and offline aspects to help define and develop the application.
 
We are actively seeking additional components to add and complement the existing ecosystem in enhancing the user experience and in accordance with the Company’s vision.
 
Yippi Languages
 
Yippi Languages is an educational tool currently functioning within the application, as we believe in life-long learning by learning languages anytime, anywhere.
 
Yippi Languages was launched in July 2017 and helps users speaking any of the following ten (10) languages to learn English: Chinese, Hindi, Hmong, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Tagalog, Thai and Vietnamese. 
 
Yippi Languages features over 100 lessons per supported language and is an invaluable tool for many to access learning modules while adopting another language as a 2nd language with audio guides in speaking natively. Modules also include interactive mini-games to enhance comprehension, and vocabulary which is vital to the learning process.
 
We are committed to further enhancing this app feature and in providing a comprehensive learning experience to the user. We have engaged third-parties to re-develop an additional UI/UX in making the app responsive and relevant with the trend.
 
We have engaged researchers to study the probable functionality of it as an e-learning tool for schools as this feature has potential in bringing affordable quick and easy language learning into the school setting or as a language guide incorporated into after-school curriculum.
 
Artificial Intelligence
 
A.I.,(artificial intelligence) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.
 


8

 
The key terms related to A.I. are computer, internet, big data and automation control. We are excited to usher in the 4th Generation Yippi that is A.I.-driven in communication in line with our view of letting the communication go smart. Among the key applications of A.I. technology that we have incorporated, we are looking for enhancements in personal assistant, education, e-commerce merchandise and automation in customer service. AI within Yippi launched in June 2018 and will be enhanced and improved in every subsequent update of the app. This is a long range project and we expect to learn a great deal as AI is a learning language. 
 
Communication
 
Read & Burn 
 
Reads & Burn is a privacy feature which was launched in July 2017 and currently functions within the chat feature. This feature provides peer-to-peer security in handling private pictures and confidential documents. The pictures and documents sent through Read & Burn are only accessible with touch and then the image disappears from the server and chat history. The pictures and documents cannot be screen-shot by the user’s smartphone.
 
We included this feature as an enhancement to the experience in Yippi. We believe this feature has its potential in the security of sending private images or confidential documents and provides the users with peace of mind in sending private documents for a single view.
 
This data will not be stored on smartphones via Yippi nor through peer-to-peer encryption when it is unopened. Through read & burn data is not stored on the servers or in history.
 
Secret Chat 
 
In addition to Read & Burn, we developed another version of our chat feature with an enhanced level of security, aptly named, Secret Chat. Launched in January 2017, this feature is a secretive function that self–destructs upon leaving the chat conversation without a record on the application as well as the server. We believe this negates the function of encrypting messages found in other chat apps proving to be a safe chat, virtually un-hackable as it does not have a trace on either servers once our proprietary system purges the chat thread.
 
Within the chat conversation, the user has almost all of the same functionalities of a regular chat, such as sending images/videos, recording voice messages, sending stickers or gifting eggs.
 
Fun Camera
 
This trendy and advanced video camera feature allows users to beautify and add animated filters as 3D Face Technology on a video call. Currently in use, this feature is app-exclusive as we developed a number of the filters and augmented reality (AR) skins.
 
Video calls are made with options to enhance both the caller and recipient with beauty skins, fun stickers, or facial-recognition augmented reality caricatures or cartoons for shared fun experience.
 
At the time of its launch in April 2018, we believe the number of possible facial enhancements via AR provided by this feature is competitive with the major native camera apps found in Samsung’s and Huawei’s latest flagship smartphones.
 
Whiteboard
 
We developed and launched Whiteboard as a unique feature in July 2017. Whiteboard enables users to simultaneously write on the screen display. The users can currently share the same whiteboard with both parties able to write and talk on a single session remotely. 
 
The voice function has an on/off switch and users could communicate while sketching together on the shared whiteboard.
 
In addition, the whiteboard could be ‘erased’ by either party at any time to clear the space for another new board for continuous writing. Sharing of info or ideas could be sketched out over the whiteboard or dictated to the other person with ease, rather than the conventional method of writing on a piece of paper before snapping a picture.
 
This is an excellent feature for sketches and scribbles as it engages a real-time experience, as well as a fun tool for leisure.

Free Chats with Voice & Video Calls
 
Yippi has embedded and enhanced the quality of Voice & Video Calls for the ease of connectivity to anyone anywhere. We expanded on the functions of our chat application in making the action of contacting friends & family with choices of Text, Voice & Video calls that is parallel with leading chat applications in the market.
 
Voice & Video quality of calls made via Yippi is clear, and, as with other chat applications, is dependent on network strength. We believe the simplicity of placing a call or a video call will be further enhanced with the advancement of technology and data speed packets as 5G connectivity is upon us.
 
From its launch in July 2017, Yippi has continued to develop and expand this feature, not just with regards to peer-to-peer calls, but also improving group calls. Group video calls enable a tele-conference from individual smartphones, anytime and anywhere; in line with the ease of communications on the go. Yippi offers a group video call of up to 9 video feeds at the moment. Continued enhancement of to this feature is important to us as we strive to offer the market standard of quality of voice and video calls to our users. 
 
Meeting Room
 
Meeting Room was launched in January 2017 and is an improvement over the standard group chat feature. The highlight of this feature is the ability to share files and to set a time frame structure for the meeting. The Meeting Room offers additional functions for the administrator to control and facilitate the chat room.
 
The Meeting Room enables discussions and meetings on subjects within a set time frame and this helps to organize chat groups in order.
 
We believe this feature has the potential of being a group chat of choice as it allows users to communicate and share files of any type with ease. This is an advantage over other chat apps as most have a limitation on what type of files are shareable, whereas we are giving the user the full sharing capabilities comparable to leading file-sharing apps available. 
 
We believe this feature could be a trend-setter as the timer in this feature is an advantage to a normal group chat. This frees up a sense of organization of the user’s chat boxes in maintaining and managing their chat conversations.
 
Forward Voice Message
 
Since its launch in July of 2017, the Yippi social messaging app enables users to forward voice messages to contacts, as well as group chat recipients. This enhances the sharing possibility of a recorded message as it is equipped in-app for the ease and functionality of the user.
 
In addition, with our propriety enhancement of built-in translation (and voice recognition); the user may use the option to translate received voice message from a selection of spoken languages.
 
People Nearby
 
With its launch in July of 2017, users can use this feature to seek out other Yippi users within their immediate area to communicate and network, or chat for leisure.
 
Yippi users can arrange a meeting and make new friends, or seek out business opportunities by networking through this feature. With the impending official brand accounts, we could evolve this further with geo-location push notification on promotions and offers for Yippi user that switches their People Nearby feature. Currently there are no brand accounts.
 
With respect to all of the features and functionalities of the Yippi App, we are looking at trends and opportunities to enhance the apps features and functionalities and to add new features. 
 
The markets for our Yippi App are characterized by rapid technological change, particularly in the technical capabilities of smartphones and tablets, and changing end-user preferences. Therefore, we will be required to continuously invest capital to innovate and modify our Yippi App and publish new apps. We cannot assure that we will have adequate capital to modify our Yippi App or develop new apps.
 
However, our ability to plan for further development of the Yippi App, distribution and promotional activities will be significantly affected by our ability to anticipate and adapt to relatively rapid changes in the tastes and preferences of our current and potential users. New and different types of entertainment may increase in popularity at the expense of mobile apps. A decline in the popularity of apps in general, or our Yippi App in particular, would harm our business and prospects. We may not be successful in developing additional features and functionality for the Yippi App.

3. Games & Contests
 
We published our game, Duck Wanted on July 2018, and the response has been positive with daily scoreboards and rewards in attracting more players in this engaging game. At the time of print, we are working on other genre of games for the release soon and building on the momentum.
 
We started an on-going contests campaign since May 2018 via Yippi Social, with Share/Comment contests on a weekly basis.

Mini-Programs are similar to apps but as it is within Yippi, accessing it won’t take up any storage space on the user’s device. Users may scan QR codes or input the names of the mini-programs in-app to launch them. The campaign to encourage talented independent developers to create mini-programs onto /and powered by our Marketplace is vital in the success of the mini-programs and thus complements our ecosystem in the near future.

The Company’s users are concentrated in Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and Singapore. The Company also intends to target potential users of the Yippi App in the United States.
Advertising
 
We compete for advertising revenue, especially with respect to video and other highly engaging formats. We believe our ability to compete depends primarily on our reach and ability to deliver a strong return on investment to our advertisers, which is driven by our advertising products, delivery and measurement capabilities, APIs, and other tools. The industry in which we operate is changing rapidly and we find ourselves in competition with internet-based platforms, advertising networks, and traditional media.
Competition
 
We compete with other companies in every aspect of our business, particularly with companies that focus on mobile engagement and advertising. Many of these companies, such as Apple, Facebook (including Instagram and WhatsApp), Tencent (including WeChat), Snap Inc. (Snapchat), Google (including YouTube), and Twitter, have significantly greater financial and human resources. Our competitors span from internet technology companies and digital platforms to traditional companies in print, radio, and television sectors to underlying technologies like default smartphone messaging. Additionally, our competition for engagement varies by region. The main bases on which we currently compete with competitors include engagement, partnerships, advertising, and talent.
 
We compete to attract and retain our users’ attention, both in terms of reach and engagement. Since our Yippi App and apps of our competitors are typically free, we compete based on our brand and the quality of our app and any potential future product offerings rather than on price. We focus on constantly improving and expanding the Yippi App and related features.
