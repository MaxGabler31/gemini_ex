ITEM 1 BUSINESS
 ﻿
 Vulcan Materials Company, a New Jersey corporation, is the nation’s largest supplier of construction aggregates (primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel) and a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Delivered by trucks, ships, barges and trains, our products are the indispensable materials building homes, offices, places of worship, schools, hospitals and factories, as well as vital infrastructure including highways, bridges, roads, ports and harbors, water systems, campuses, dams, airports and rail networks. As of December 31, 2017, we had 375 active aggregates facilities, 64 asphalt facilities and 57 concrete facilities. BUSINESS STRATEGY
 We provide the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to maintain and expand the U.S. economy. We operate primarily in the U.S. and are the nation’s largest supplier of construction aggregates (primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel) and a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Our strategy and competitive advantage are based on our strength in aggregates. Aggregates are used in most types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Our materials are used to build the roads, tunnels, bridges, railroads and airports that connect us, and to build the hospitals, schools, shopping centers, factories and places of worship that are essential to our lives and the economy.
 business strategies
 Our business strategies include: (1) aggregates focus, (2) coast-to-coast footprint, (3) profitable growth, (4) managing volume, product mix and price to grow profitability, and (5) effective land management. 
 1. AGGREGATES FOCUS
 Aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private construction and practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist. Given our focus on aggregates, we:

BUILD AND HOLD SUBSTANTIAL RESERVES: Our reserves are critical to our long-term success. They are strategically located throughout the United States in high-growth areas that are expected to require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand. Moreover, there are significant barriers to entry in many metropolitan markets due to stringent zoning and permitting regulations. Aggregates operations have flexible production capabilities and, other than energy inputs required to process the materials, require virtually no other raw material. Our downstream businesses (asphalt and concrete) use Vulcan-produced aggregates almost exclusively.

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SIZE AND SCALE: Each aggregates operation is unique because of its location within a local market with particular geological characteristics. Every operation, however, uses a similar group of assets to produce saleable aggregates and provide customer service. We are the largest aggregates supplier in the U.S. Our 375 active aggregates facilities as of December 31, 2017, provide opportunities to standardize operating practices and procure equipment (fixed and mobile), parts, supplies and services in an efficient and cost-effective manner, both regionally and nationally. Additionally, we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support, customer service, accounting, procurement, technical support and engineering.

2. COAST-TO-COAST FOOTPRINT
 Demand for construction aggregates correlates positively with changes in population growth, household formation and employment. We have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in U.S. metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly. Our strategic locations serve 19 of the top 25 highest-growth U.S. metropolitan areas in 20 states plus the District of Columbia.

 ﻿
 3. PROFITABLE GROWTH
 Our long-term growth is a result of strategic acquisitions and investments in key operations.

Strategic acquisitions AND DISPOSITIONS: Since becoming a public company in 1957, Vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions. For example, in 1999 we acquired CalMat Co., thereby expanding our aggregates operations into California and Arizona and making us one of the nation’s leading producers of asphalt mix. In 2007, we acquired Florida Rock Industries, Inc., the largest acquisition in our history. This acquisition expanded our aggregates business in Florida and our aggregates and ready-mixed concrete businesses in other southeastern and mid-Atlantic states. 
 Additionally, throughout our history we have completed many bolt-on acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth. In 2017, we made a number of bolt-on acquisitions, making attractive additions to our coast-to-coast footprint in states ranging from Georgia to California and up to Illinois and Virginia. We added approximately 615 million tons of proven and probable reserves to our leading reserve base, further strengthened our best-in-class aggregates distribution network (adding 16 new rail yards in our Florida, Georgia and South Carolina markets) and added asphalt operations in Tennessee to take further advantage of our strong aggregates position.

§ | Reinvestment opportunities with high returns: Demand for our products is dependent on construction activity and correlates positively with changes in population growth, household formation and employment. During the period 2018 - 2028, Moody's Analytics projects that 79% of the U.S. population growth, 70% of household formation and 64% of new jobs will occur in Vulcan-served states. The close proximity of our production facilities and our aggregates reserves to this projected population growth creates many opportunities to invest capital in high-return projects — projects that will add reserves, increase production capacity and decrease costs.

 4. MANAGING VOLUME, PRODUCT MIX AND PRICE TO GROW PROFITABILITY
 We focus on three major profit drivers that must be managed in combination.

§ | Price for Service — We seek to receive full and fair value for the quality of products and services we provide. We should be paid appropriately for helping our customers be successful. Our expanding margins will continue to benefit from the compounding pricing gains associated with cyclical recoveries. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Operating Efficiency and Leverage — We focus on rigorous cost management throughout the economic cycle. Small savings per ton add up to significant cost reductions. We are operating a capital-intensive business well below full capacity and are extremely well positioned to further leverage fixed costs to sales as we move forward.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Sales and Production Mix — We adjust production levels to meet varying market conditions. Managing inventories responsibly results in improved cost performance and an improved return on capital. As the recovery continues and as we see a larger portion of new construction activity in the end-use mix, we will sell the entire production mix much more efficiently and at fuller value.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We manage these factors locally, and align our talent and incentives accordingly. Our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilities allow us to manage operational and overhead costs aggressively. Recovery in demand serves as a tailwind for all three major profit drivers.

5. EFFECTIVE LAND MANAGEMENT
 We own or lease well over 200,000 acres of land, and we manage it carefully throughout all phases of its productive use. We believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success. As a land-based company, we feel a special responsibility to the environment and the communities around us. Good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as long-term planning because mining, ultimately, is an interim use of the land. Therefore, we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective post-mining land management. We continue to focus our actions on prudent decisions regarding the life cycle management of the land we own. PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
 Our aggregates reserves are strategically located throughout the United States in areas that are projected to grow faster than the national average and that require large amounts of aggregates to meet construction demand. Vulcan-served states are estimated to generate 79% of the total growth in U.S. population and 70% of the total growth in U.S. household formations between 2018 and 2028.

﻿ | VULCAN’S TOP TEN REVENUE PRODUCING STATES IN 2017 | 
﻿ | 1. | California | 6. | Florida 
﻿ | 2. | Texas | 7. | Arizona 
﻿ | 3. | Virginia | 8. | North Carolina
﻿ | 4. | Tennessee | 9. | South Carolina
﻿ | 5. | Georgia | 10. | Illinois 

  ﻿
 Our top ten revenue producing states accounted for 85% of our 2017 revenues while our top five accounted for 60%.
 We take a disciplined approach to strengthening our footprint by increasing our presence in U.S. metropolitan areas that are expected to grow more rapidly and by divesting assets that are no longer considered part of our long-term growth strategy. In 2017, we swapped our concrete operations in Arizona for strategic asphalt operations also in Arizona. Additionally, we strengthened our positions in our top ten revenue producing states via bolt-on acquisitions in California, Texas, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Arizona, South Carolina and Illinois.
 PRODUCT LINES
 We have four operating (and reportable) segments organized around our principal product lines:

1. | Aggregates – 73% of 2017’s total revenues and 86% of gross profit
---+------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Asphalt – 16% of 2017’s total revenues and 9% of gross profit
---+--------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Concrete – 11% of 2017’s total revenues and 5% of gross profit
---+---------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Calcium – less than 1% of 2017’s total revenues and less than 1% of gross profit

1. AGGREGATES
 Our construction aggregates are used in a number of ways:

§ | as a base material underneath highways, walkways, airport runways, parking lots and railroads
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | to aid in water filtration, purification and erosion control
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


§ | as a raw material used in combination with other resources to construct many of the items we rely on to sustain our quality of life including:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | houses and apartments
--+----------------------


§ | roads, bridges and parking lots
--+--------------------------------


§ | schools and hospitals
--+----------------------


§ | commercial buildings and retail space
--+--------------------------------------


§ | sewer systems
--+--------------


§ | power plants
--+-------------


§ | airports and runways
--+---------------------

  Factors that affect the U.S. aggregates industry and our business include:

§ | Location of reserves: We currently have 16.0 billion tons of permitted and proven or probable aggregates reserves. The bulk of these reserves are located in areas where we expect greater than average rates of growth in population, jobs and households, which require new infrastructure, housing, offices, schools and other development. Zoning and permitting regulations in some markets have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries. These restrictions curtail expansion in certain areas, but they also increase the value of our reserves at existing locations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Limited product substitution: There are limited substitutes for quality aggregates. Recycled concrete and asphalt have certain applications as a lower-cost alternative to virgin aggregates. However, due to technical specifications many types of construction projects cannot be served by recycled concrete and require the use of virgin aggregates to meet specifications and performance-based criteria for durability, strength and other qualities. Moreover, the amount of recycled asphalt included in asphalt mix as a substitute for aggregates is limited due to specifications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Highly fragmented industry: The U.S. aggregates industry is composed of over 5,700 companies that manage more than 10,000 operations. This fragmented structure provides many opportunities for consolidation. Companies in the industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Through strategic acquisitions and investments, we have developed an unmatched coast-to-coast footprint of strategically located permitted reserves concentrated in and serving the nation’s key growth centers. We have over 20,000 customers in 20 states, the District of Columbia, Mexico and the Bahamas.

§ | Flexible production capabilities: The production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and, through a series of screens, separated into various sizes depending on how it will be used. Production capacity can be flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | raw material inputs largely under our control: Unlike typical industrial manufacturing industries, the aggregates industry does not require the input of raw material beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves. Stone, sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources. However, production does require the use of explosives, hydrocarbon fuels and electric power.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Part I | 7


§ | Local markets: Aggregates have a high weight-to-value ratio and, in most cases, must be produced near where they are used; if not, transportation can cost more than the materials, rendering them uncompetitive compared to locally produced materials. Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available high-quality aggregates. We serve these markets from quarries that have access to cost-effective long-haul transportation — shipping by barge and rail — and from our quarry on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula with our fleet of Panamax-class, self-unloading ships.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We operate an extensive logistics network along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard as shown below:

 ﻿
 Where practical, we have operations located close to our local markets because the cost of trucking materials long distances is prohibitive. Approximately 80% of our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively from the producing location to the customer by truck, and another 15% are delivered by truck after reaching a sales yard by rail or water. The remaining 5% of aggregates shipments are delivered directly to the customer by rail or water.

 
Part I | 8


§ | Demand cycles: Long-term growth in demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population, jobs and households. While short-term and medium-term demand for aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles, declines have historically been followed by strong recoveries, with each peak establishing a new historical high.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The drivers underpinning demand recovery — and sustained, multi-year volume and pricing growth — remain firmly in place, in both the public and private sectors of the economy. They include: population growth; gains in total employment and in household income and wages; a continuing increase in household formations; the growing need for additional housing stock and housing demand; a multi-year federal transportation law in place and continuing increases in transportation funding at state and local levels; record state tax receipts; public investment in infrastructure that is still well below the long-term trend-line, and increasing political awareness and acceptance of the need to invest in infrastructure.
 AGGREGATES MARKETS
 We focus on the U.S. markets with above-average long-term expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand. Because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates, our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or have access to economical transportation via rail, barge or ship to a particular end market. We serve both the public and the private sectors.
 Public sector construction activity has historically been more stable and less cyclical than privately-funded construction, and generally requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending. Private sector construction (primarily residential and nonresidential buildings) typically is more affected by general economic cycles than publicly funded projects (particularly highways, roads and bridges), which tend to receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles.

 PUBLIC SECTOR CONSTRUCTION
 Public sector construction includes spending by federal, state, and local governments for highways, bridges, buildings, airports, schools and prisons as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems, water supply systems, dams, reservoirs and other public construction projects. Construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources. In 2017, publicly funded construction accounted for approximately 46% of our total aggregates shipments, and approximately 24% of our aggregates sales by volume were used in highway construction projects.
§ | Public Sector Funding: Generally, public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction spending; public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and spending has historically been supported by multi-year laws, which provide certainty in funding amounts, program structures, and rules and regulations. Federal spending is governed by authorization, budget and appropriations laws. The level of state and local spending on infrastructure varies across the United States and depends on individual state needs and economies. In 2017, seven state legislatures voted to raise motor fuel taxes for transportation investments, bringing the total to 31 states since 2012. States are also raising revenues through one-time increases in revenues outside of fuel taxes. In the 2017 general election, voters in twenty states approved more than 80% of local transportation investment ballot measures; since 2007, 74% of more than 1,200 measures have been approved. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | federal highway funding: In December 2015, President Obama signed a new, long-term federal highway and transit authorization bill, Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Infrastructure Act (FAST Act), into law after the final legislation received strong, bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate. The FAST Act provides multi-year funding to state and local governments in support of road, bridge, intermodal and public transportation projects. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The FAST Act increases Federal-Aid Highway Program funding from $41 billion in the federal fiscal year (FFY) 2015 to $47 billion in FFY 2020. Federal spending for highways is supported by $208 billion in excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuels, taxes on heavy truck sales and use, and heavy truck tire taxes and by a $70 billion transfer of general funds to the Federal Highway Trust Fund.
 The long-term nature of the FAST Act is important. The Federal-Aid Highway Program is the largest component of the law and has provided, on average, 52% of all state capital investment in roads and bridges over the last 10 years. This multi-year authorization and the associated dedicated funding provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute long-range, complex highway projects.
 The FAST Act also contains important policy changes. To further accelerate the project delivery process, it augments the environmental review and permitting process reforms contained in the prior law, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). The new law also provides assistance for states making investments in major capital projects — particularly freight projects. In states where we operate, we are well-positioned to serve the large general contractors who will compete for new freight and other major capacity projects that will move forward with this FAST Act funding and policy implementation.
 Project financing remains an important additional component of overall surface transportation spending, with the Transportation Infrastructure Finance & Innovation Act (TIFIA) program authorized at $275 million (in line with the previous program outlays) and growing to $300 million by 2020. The FAST Act also created a new National Surface Transportation and Innovative Finance Bureau to provide technical assistance to states seeking to pursue public-private partnerships and other financing arrangements for transportation projects.

§ | WATER INFRASTRUCTURE: The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016 (WIIN), which we and numerous other business allies strongly supported, was signed into law in December 2016. This law is the successor to the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA). It reauthorizes needed investment in America’s ports, channels, locks, dams, and other infrastructure that supports the maritime and waterways transportation system and provides flood protection for communities. It also provides funding to the Water Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act (WIFIA), which was modeled after the highly popular TIFIA program in the surface transportation sector. Created in WRRDA, WIFIA will allow for federal credit assistance to water resources projects in the form of low-cost loans, loan guarantees and lines of credit.

 Private sector CONSTRUCTION
 The private sector construction markets include both nonresidential building construction and residential construction and are considerably more cyclical than public construction. In 2017, privately-funded construction accounted for approximately 54% of our total aggregates shipments.

§ | Nonresidential Construction: Private nonresidential building construction includes a wide array of projects. Such projects generally are more aggregates intensive than residential construction. Overall demand in private nonresidential construction generally is driven by job growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. The growth of the private workforce creates demand for offices, hotels and restaurants. Likewise, population growth generates demand for stores, shopping centers, warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals, places of worship and entertainment facilities. Large industrial projects, such as a new manufacturing facility, can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firm's ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing. This end market also includes capital investments in public nonresidential facilities to meet the needs of a growing population.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Nonresidential construction is expected to continue to be a stable source of volume growth in 2018 based on the following assumptions: (1) continuing employment growth should provide support, as it has in the past, (2) current backlogs that our customers, industry groups and outside economists are reporting should continue to be a source of demand, and (3) with a stable tax base, local governments should use funds to make capital investments in schools and other public nonresidential facilities to meet the needs of a growing population.

§ | Residential Construction: Household formations in our markets continue to outpace household formations in the rest of the United States. The majority of residential construction is for single-family housing with the remainder consisting of multi-family construction (i.e., two family houses, apartment buildings and condominiums). Public housing comprises only a small portion of housing demand. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage financing and builders’ ability to maintain skilled labor.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  U.S. housing starts, as measured by Dodge Data & Analytics data, peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually. By the end of 2009, total housing starts had declined to less than 0.6 million units, well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually. In 2017, total annual housing starts in the U.S. reached almost 1.3 million units. Housing starts were particularly robust in our markets, which grew at almost twice the rate of the nation as a whole. The consistent growth in residential construction bodes well for continued recovery in our markets.
 ADDITIONAL AGGREGATES PRODUCTS AND MARKETS
 We sell aggregates that are used as ballast for construction and maintenance of railroad tracks. We also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along roads and waterways. In addition, stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives, fillers and extenders. Coal-burning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions. Limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as agricultural lime.
 We sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the United States, principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Nondomestic sales and long-lived assets outside the United States are reported in Note 15 "Segment Reporting" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
 VERTICAL INTEGRATION
 While aggregates is our focus and primary business, we believe vertical integration between aggregates and downstream products, such as asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete, can be managed effectively in certain markets generating acceptable financial returns and enhancing financial returns in our core Aggregates segment. We produce and sell asphalt mix and/or ready-mixed concrete primarily in our mid-Atlantic, Georgia, Southwestern, Tennessee and Western markets. Aggregates comprise approximately 95% of asphalt mix by weight and 80% of ready-mixed concrete by weight. In both of these downstream businesses, aggregates are primarily supplied from our operations.
Part I | 11

 2. ASPHALT
 We produce and sell asphalt mix in Arizona, California, New Mexico, Tennessee and Texas. In December 2017, we strengthened our asphalt position in Arizona by swapping ready-mixed concrete operations for an asphalt mix operation. In January 2017, we entered the Tennessee market through the acquisition of several asphalt mix operations and a construction paving business. This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix, comprising approximately 95% by weight of this product. We meet the aggregates requirements for our Asphalt segment primarily through our Aggregates segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.
 Because asphalt mix hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility. The asphalt mix production process requires liquid asphalt cement, which we purchase from third-party producers. We do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate. We serve our Asphalt segment customers either directly from our local production facilities or through our distribution yards. 
 3. CONCRETE
 We produce and sell ready-mixed concrete in California, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, Texas, Virginia, Washington D.C. and the Bahamas. In May 2015, we entered the Arizona ready-mixed concrete market through the acquisition of ready-mixed concrete operations in conjunction with the acquisition of aggregates operations in Arizona and New Mexico. As noted above, in December 2017 we exited the Arizona ready-mixed concrete market via a swap for an asphalt mix operation continuing our strategy to focus on asphalt mix in that market. In January 2015, we swapped our ready-mixed concrete operations in California for asphalt mix operations, primarily in Arizona. In March 2017, we reentered the California ready-mixed concrete market through an acquisition. For additional details see Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
 This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in ready-mixed concrete, comprising approximately 80% by weight of this product. We meet the aggregates requirements of our Concrete segment primarily through our Aggregates segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.
 We serve our Concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck. Because ready-mixed concrete hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility. Ready-mixed concrete production also requires cement which we purchase from third-party producers. We do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate.
 4. CALCIUM
 Our Calcium segment is composed of a single calcium operation in Brooksville, Florida. This facility produces calcium products for the animal feed, plastics and water treatment industries with high quality calcium carbonate material mined at the Brooksville quarry. OTHER BUSINESS-RELATED ITEMS
 SEASONALITY AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS
 Almost all of our products are produced and consumed outdoors. Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products. Therefore, the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quarter. Furthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions, demographic and population fluctuations, and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, primarily in the private sector.
Part I | 12

COMPETITORS
 We operate in a generally fragmented industry with a large number of small, privately-held companies. We estimate that the ten largest aggregates producers accounted for less than one-third of total U.S. aggregates production in 2017. Despite being the industry leader, Vulcan’s total U.S. market share is less than 10%. Other publicly traded companies among the ten largest U.S. aggregates producers include the following:
§ | Cemex S.A.B. de C.V.
--+---------------------


§ | CRH plc
--+--------


§ | HeidelbergCement AG
--+--------------------


§ | LafargeHolcim
--+--------------


§ | Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.
--+--------------------------------


§ | MDU Resources Group, Inc.
--+--------------------------


§ | Summit Materials, Inc.
--+-----------------------

  Because the U.S. aggregates industry is highly fragmented, with over 5,700 companies managing more than 10,000 operations during 2017, many opportunities for consolidation exist. Therefore, companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to enter new markets or extend their existing market positions.
 CUSTOMERS
 No material part of our business depends upon any single customer whose loss would have a significant adverse effect on our business. In 2017, our five largest customers accounted for 7.3% of our total revenues (excluding internal sales), and no single customer accounted for more than 2.4% of our total revenues. Our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities. Although approximately 45% to 55% of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction, such as highways, airports and government buildings, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction, our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments. ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION
 Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and safety; examples include regulation of facility air emissions and water discharges, waste management, protection of wetlands, listed and threatened species, noise and dust exposure control for workers, and safety regulations under both Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment, and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs. We estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2018 and 2019 will be $14.9 million and $29.4 million, respectively. These anticipated expenditures are not expected to have a material impact on our earnings or competitive position.
 We have received notices from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a limited number of sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state and local environmental laws. Generally we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other PRPs or alleged PRPs in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations. There is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual party's share in that cost. As a result, estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available about the nature or extent of site contamination, remediation methods, other PRPs and their probable level of involvement, and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.
 For additional information about litigation and environmental matters, see Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."


 
Part I | 13

 

 

 Frequently, we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites. These reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises. The fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site. The liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. To determine the fair value, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation, which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin. All reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually. Reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills. However, no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability.
