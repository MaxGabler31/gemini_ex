ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Company Overview
Logitech is a world leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing products that help connect people to digital and cloud experiences. Forty years ago, Logitech created products to improve experiences around the personal computer ("PC") platform, and today it is a multi-brand, multi-category company designing products that enable people to pursue their passions and connect to the world. Logitech’s products align with several large secular trends including work and learn from anywhere, video everywhere, the increasing popularity of gaming as a spectator and participant sport, and the democratization of content creation. Logitech's brands include Logitech, Logitech G, ASTRO Gaming, Streamlabs, Blue Microphones and Ultimate Ears. Our Company's website is www.logitech.com.
Logitech was founded in Switzerland in 1981, and Logitech International S.A. has been the parent holding company of Logitech since 1988. Logitech International S.A. is a Swiss holding company with its registered office in Hautemorges, Switzerland, which conducts its business through subsidiaries in the Americas (including North and South America), EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) and Asia Pacific (including, among other countries, China, Taiwan, Japan, India and Australia). Shares of Logitech International S.A. are listed on both the SIX Swiss Exchange, under the trading symbol LOGN, and the Nasdaq Global Select Market, under the trading symbol LOGI.

We sell our products to a broad network of domestic and international customers, including direct sales to retailers and e-tailers, enterprise customers and consumers, and indirect sales through distributors. Our worldwide channel network includes consumer electronics distributors, retailers, e-tailers, mass merchandisers, specialty stores, computer and telecommunications stores, value-added resellers and online merchants. 
From time to time, we may seek to partner with or acquire, when appropriate, companies that have products, personnel, and technologies that complement our strategic direction.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 3—Business Acquisitions in our Notes to consolidated financial statements. 
Industry Overview
Historically, Logitech's business has been driven by the same trends that drove the adoption of desktop and laptop PCs for consumers and businesses, including the growth in affordable processing power, communications bandwidth, the increased accessibility of digital content, and the growing and pervasive use of the Internet for productivity, communication and entertainment. More recently, the increase in remote and hybrid work and learning, the expansion of video everywhere, the rise in gaming as a participant and spectator sport and the growth in streamers and creators fueled by the democratization of content creation have created multiple opportunities for Logitech to drive greater interaction and engagement between people and digital content. 
In the past few years, new PC shipments have steadily increased and, combined with increased interest in smaller, mobile computing devices (such as smartphones and tablets), the market for PC peripherals has greatly expanded. We see opportunities within the large installed base of PCs, created by consumers' desire to refresh their current PC experiences with new peripherals, as well as new trends developing within the connected device ecosystems. In addition, the adoption of hybrid work has increased the number of new workspaces, thereby creating expanded opportunities to attach multiple peripherals. Consumers are also enhancing their tablet experience with a range of keyboards and cases that enable them to create, consume and do more with their tablets conveniently and comfortably. The recent shift toward remote and hybrid learning environments has also expanded the addressable education market for tablet keyboards and cases, as well as for other PC peripherals.
Growing adoption of cloud-based experiences in gaming, video and music has also increased our addressable market opportunities. More and more consumers today interact with cloud-based content platforms, such as Steam and Twitch for gaming, or Zoom and Microsoft Teams for video collaboration. Logitech offers peripherals and accessories to enhance the use of such cloud-based content platforms. 
Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K | 3


In the gaming market, the rapid rise of esports and the growth of live streamers on platforms such as Twitch and broadcasters on platforms such as YouTube continue to drive growth. We leverage our deep research and development ("R&D") capabilities in the area of PC peripherals that include Pointing Devices, Keyboards & Combos and PC Webcams, to develop industry-leading gaming gear that enhances consumers' overall gaming experience and performance. As consumers increasingly watch various esports tournaments or other gaming broadcasts on cloud-based platforms such as Twitch, the gaming industry is becoming both a source of entertainment and participation by mainstream consumers. We sponsor and work closely with esports athletes to improve our brand and the quality and functionality of our gaming products. We also offer gaming peripherals that enhance the experience of more casual gamers.
The adoption of video everywhere - in large and small conference rooms and at home -- is a continuing trend that has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The video communication industry continues to make progress toward a vision in which people can conduct a video call from any of a variety of platforms - video-enabled rooms, PCs, laptops and mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones - to any other platform. This trend to embrace cloud video conferencing by businesses and institutions and, in particular, the growing adoption of remote work, learning, and telemedicine, is driving sales of our Video Collaboration category and offers a long-term growth opportunity for Logitech. For businesses and institutions, video conferencing is increasingly substituted for travel, because of high travel costs as well as the productivity gain that can be achieved by a high-quality, face-to-face meeting that does not require travel away from the office. For some schools, remote learning has become a complementary or, in some cases, an alternative way to educate students. Further, with the increased availability of high Internet bandwidth, video conferencing is becoming a key component of Unified Communications, which is the integration of communications solutions such as voicemail, e-mail, chat, presentation sharing and live video meetings. The market opportunity to provide innovative, affordable, and easy-to-use video collaboration products to the millions of small- medium- and large-sized meeting rooms lacking video is substantial, and we are well-positioned to take advantage of that opportunity. 
Cloud-based music services have experienced growth across the industry, fueled by smartphones, tablets, and other connected devices. Consumers are optimizing their audio experiences on their tablets and smartphones with a variety of music peripherals including wireless mobile speakers and in-ear and other headphones. Within the music category, the market for mobile speakers has matured and the integration of personal voice assistants has increased competition in the speaker category. Consumers are increasingly listening with wireless earphones while they undertake activities such as sports and fitness. The innovation in truly wireless headphones has led to industry growth in revenue, which highlights a growth opportunity for Logitech. In addition, consumers are increasingly streaming and broadcasting using microphones and other peripherals which also expands our opportunities. 
Business Strategy
Logitech's foundation for future growth is built on five core capabilities that apply to all of our product categories: 
•Design; 
•Engineering;
•Go-to-market;
•Marketing; and
•Operations. 
Design
In the past few years, Logitech has strengthened its design capabilities by building a world-class team of internal designers. Our designs have an everyday place in people’s lives, connecting them to the digital experiences they care about. These products have been earning prestigious design awards - 202 design awards during the past three fiscal years - and enthusiastic reviews in the media. This is one indication that Logitech’s strategic aim to become a design company is working. During fiscal year 2022, we won 50 design awards. As Logitech establishes itself as a design company, design thinking and culture are used as a strategic and cultural differentiator. Design also helps to reduce product costs through increased collaboration between our design, engineering and manufacturing teams. Our key design centers are in Switzerland, Ireland, the United States, and Taiwan.
Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K | 4


Engineering
Our decades-long expertise in key engineering disciplines such as sensors, acoustics, optics, wireless, and power management is a core competitive advantage of Logitech. Furthermore, we continue to extend our engineering capabilities into more advanced technologies such as software, apps, cloud, data analytics, machine learning and some core building blocks of navigation and tracking in augmented reality ("AR") / virtual reality ("VR"). Our engineering team has expertise in developing products for a broad array of platforms such as PCs, mobile and personal voice assistants (such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant). These engineering capabilities combined with our award-winning design team form the basis of Logitech's key innovation engine. 
 Go-To-Market
Over the past 30-plus years, Logitech has built an extensive global go-to-market network that can be leveraged as we introduce new products, enter new market categories and optimize the value of our existing products and product categories. We have multiple opportunities to drive growth - existing products in existing and new retailers, and e-tailers as well as new products in existing and new retailers and e-tailers. Beyond online and offline retail and distribution channels, we have also strengthened other commercial channels. As we increase our investments in Video Collaboration, we are also expanding our enterprise sales coverage through our sales force as well as various channel partners. And with expansions into new channels, there are numerous cross-selling opportunities across our broad product portfolio. We have established Logitech as a neutral technology supplier that can work with a variety of leading technology vendors and platforms as well as provide connections among their products and ecosystems. 
 Marketing
As Logitech continues to expand into multiple categories, we are focusing on enhancing our marketing capabilities around brand strategy and execution, digital marketing, and marketing technology. With our products and designs as a foundation, we are building in consumer-centricity and demonstrating the relevancy of our products in the lives of our consumers. We are increasing our brand marketing investments to drive greater brand awareness and consideration, delivering advertising campaigns across our brand, our categories, and our products, which enables us to drive brand value and pivot from a push model to a demand generating pull model. Most of the marketing and creative efforts that were once outsourced to outside marketing agencies are now executed through our internal teams from concept to execution, which improves speed and cost efficiency. We are increasing our leverage of digital media channels and programs, and building relationships with creators to drive brand engagement and purchase across B2B and B2C. We are also increasing our focus on marketing analytics and platforms to improve our understanding of marketing investments and to maximize our return on investment. Additionally, we are making investments to upgrade and expand all aspects of our marketing technology infrastructure, including the re-platforming of our websites to support the global expansion of our brands across countries, enabling direct relationships with our consumers and customers and building the foundation for the acceleration of more personalized consumer communication and commerce. 
Operations
Logitech’s operations capability consists of a hybrid model of in-house manufacturing and third-party contract manufacturers, which allows us to effectively respond to rapidly changing demand and leverage economies of scale. Our supply chain’s extensive global reach, key distribution channels, adoption of factory automation and strategic business relationships combined with extensive analytic modeling expertise, optimization tools and global processes provide a competitive advantage against many of our competitors. 
Products
Logitech designs, manufactures and markets products that allow people to connect through computing, gaming, video, music, and other digital platforms. The large majority of our revenue has historically been derived from sales of our products for use by consumers while more recently we have experienced growth in sales of our products to enterprise customers.

Smart Home 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we made the decision to discontinue manufacturing and selling our Harmony line of advanced home entertainment controllers as the way people consume content has shifted to streaming services across multiple screens.

Sales and Distribution
Our sales and marketing activities are organized into three geographic regions: the Americas (North and South America), EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) and Asia Pacific (China, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, India and other countries).
We sell our products primarily to a network of distributors, retailers and e-tailers. We support these channels with our direct sales force and third-party distribution centers located in North America, South America, Europe and Asia Pacific. 
 Our distributor customers typically resell products to retailers, value-added resellers, systems integrators and other distributors with whom Logitech does not have a direct relationship.
Logitech's products can be purchased in a number of major retail chains, where we typically have access to significant shelf space. In addition, Logitech products can be purchased online either directly or indirectly from Logitech.com or through e-tailers, the websites of our major retail chains, and others. Logitech products are also carried by business-to-business direct market resellers.
In fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, Amazon Inc. and its affiliated entities together accounted for 17%, 13% and 14% of our gross sales, respectively.

Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K | 8


Customer Service and Technical Support
Our customer service organization provides user technical support, support related to product inquiry, and order support. We support these customer service functions with two outsourced operations that have support centers located in China, South Korea, India, the Philippines, Mexico, the United States, Bulgaria, Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom. Our customer service and technical personnel in each of our regions provide support services to retail purchasers of products through telephone, e-mail, forums, chat, and the Logitech Support website. For some of our brands, dedicated support websites, dedicated internal support teams and channels are available. To improve our customers' experience and operate efficiently, we use technology to facilitate chatbot interactions, enable self-help and apply Artificial Intelligence to optimize support searches. Logitech provides warranties on our branded products that range from one to five years. For our Video Collaboration category, we also work with channel partners to offer bundled support services with Logitech Video Collaboration solutions.
In Korea and China, there are multiple locations where consumers may obtain service for their Logitech products. These locations are managed by third-party logistics providers. Consumers who have purchased Logitech products can visit these locations for product inspection, testing and return or exchange of products. Within China, there is also a mail-in center to provide these services for more remote locations in China.
Manufacturing
Logitech's manufacturing operations consist principally of final assembly and testing. Since 1994, we have had our own manufacturing operations in Suzhou, China, which currently handles approximately half of our total production of products. We continue to focus on ensuring the efficiency of the Suzhou facilities, through the implementation of quality management, automation, process improvements, and employee involvement programs. We outsource the remaining production to contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers located in Asia. Both our in-house and outsourced manufacturing operations are managed by our worldwide operations group. The worldwide operations group also supports the business units and marketing and sales organizations through the management of distribution centers and the supply chain and logistics networks. 
New product launches, process engineering, commodities management, logistics, quality assurance, operations management and management of Logitech's contract manufacturers occur in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Certain components are manufactured to Logitech's specifications by vendors in Asia, the United States, and Europe. We also use contract manufacturers to supplement internal capacity and to reduce volatility in production volumes. In addition, some products, including most keyboards, certain gaming devices and certain audio products are manufactured by contract manufacturers to Logitech's specifications. 
Our hybrid model of in-house manufacturing and contract manufacturers allows us to effectively respond to rapidly changing demand and leverage economies of scale. Through our high-volume manufacturing operations located in Suzhou, China, we believe we have been able to maintain strong quality process controls and have realized significant cost efficiencies. Our Suzhou operation provides for increased production capacity, manufacturing know-how, IP protection and greater flexibility in responding to product demand. Further, by outsourcing the manufacturing of certain products, we seek to reduce volatility in production volumes as well as improve time to market.
Competition
Our product categories are characterized by large, well-financed competitors, short product life cycles, continual performance enhancements, and rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors in our retail markets. We have experienced aggressive price competition and other promotional activities from our primary competitors and less-established brands, including brands owned by some retail customers known as house brands. We may also encounter more competition if any of our competitors in one or more categories decide to enter other categories in which we currently operate.
As we target opportunities in new categories and markets and as some of our product categories demonstrate growth, we are confronting new competitors, many of which may have more experience in the categories or markets and have greater marketing resources and brand name recognition than we have. In addition, because of the continuing convergence of the markets for computing devices and consumer electronics, we expect greater competition in the future from well-established consumer electronics companies in our developing categories, as well as future ones we might enter. Many of these companies have greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and other resources than we have. 
Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K | 9

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
Intellectual property rights that apply to Logitech's products and services include patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets.
We hold various United States patents and pending applications, together with corresponding patents and pending applications from other countries. While we believe that patent protection is important, we also believe that patents are of less competitive significance than factors such as technological innovation, ease of use, and quality design. No single patent is in itself essential to Logitech as a whole. From time to time, we receive claims that we may be infringing on patents or other intellectual property rights of others. As appropriate, claims are referred to 
Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K | 10


legal counsel, and current claims are in various stages of evaluation and negotiation. If necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses for certain intellectual property rights. Refer also to the discussion in Item 1A "Risk Factors—"We may be unable to protect our proprietary rights. Unauthorized use of our technology may result in the development of products that compete with our products." and "Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology could adversely affect our business."
To distinguish genuine Logitech products from competing products and counterfeit products, Logitech has used, registered, or applied to register certain trademarks and trade names in the United States and other countries and jurisdictions. Logitech enforces its trademark and trade name rights in the United States and other countries. In addition, the software for Logitech's products and services is entitled to copyright protection, and we generally require our customers to obtain a software license before providing them with that software. We also protect details about our products and services as trade secrets through employee training, license and non-disclosure agreements, technical measures and other reasonable efforts to preserve confidentiality.
Material Government Regulations
We conduct operations in a number of countries and we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations which vary from country to country. Such laws and regulations include, in addition to environmental regulations described below, tax, import/export and anti-corruption laws, varying accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, import or export restrictions or licensing requirements, trade protection measures, custom duties, tariffs, import or export duties, and other trade barriers, restrictions and regulations. 
While we incur increasing costs to comply with such other government regulations, we do not believe that our compliance with such requirements will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, competitive position, consolidated results of operations, earnings, or cash flows. Nonetheless, as discussed below, we believe that certain environmental, social and governance ("ESG") regulations could potentially materially impact our business.
For more information about such regulations and how they may impact us, see "Risks Related to our Global Operations and Regulatory Environment" and “We are subject to risks related to our environmental, social and governance activities and disclosures” in Item 1A "Risk Factors" and Note 7—Income Taxes in our Notes to consolidated financial statements below. 
Environmental Regulation
We are subject to environmental regulations in a number of jurisdictions, including the following regulations:
Targeted Substances. Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws.
Our products are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use, including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products. 
Stewardship: In Europe, Logitech products are regulated by a number of end-of-life stewardship directives including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directive, the Packaging Directive and the Battery Directive, which require producers of electrical goods, packaging, and batteries to finance the collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of relevant products. Similar legislation exists in many countries worldwide. 
Conflict Minerals: Sourcing of certain metals is regulated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, specifically Section 1502, which addresses the use of "Conflict Minerals" in the supply chain. Similar legislation is emerging in other countries worldwide. We have established systems which facilitate our compliance with the sourcing, traceability and reporting obligations and the reporting requirements of this Act aligned with guidelines published by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”) and the Responsible Minerals Initiative, we participate in the industry-wide Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative and its Responsible Minerals Assessment Program (“RMAP”). The RMAP standards are developed to meet the requirements of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance, the Regulation (EU) 2017/821 of the European Parliament and the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Modern Slavery: Our commitment to combat slavery and human trafficking is underpinned by the Transparency in Supply Chain Act of 2010 (S.B. 657), the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act of 2015, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, the Australian Modern Slavery Act of 2018 and exiting or emerging similar legislation worldwide. We utilize our adherence to the RBA code of conduct and transparently report our programs to identify and eradicate slavery and human trafficking in global supply chains. 
Climate & Carbon: Our operations, supply chain and products are not currently subject to carbon pricing or other legally required carbon taxation or penalties. We have made a voluntary adherence to the Paris Accord international agreement for climate action and we have developed and adopted the principle of Carbon Transparency to catalyze reductions in our corporate carbon footprint, uptake of renewable power and materials and our journey to net zero. With our annual Sustainability Report and Carbon Disclosure Project reports, we report progress, risks and opportunities around climate and carbon. 
Our operations, supply chain and our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and international treaties relating to climate change, such as climate disclosure, carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements, requiring us to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines. We strive to continually improve the energy and carbon efficiency of our operations, supply chain and product portfolio. We are committed to carbon transparency through product carbon footprint labeling and ensuring that the consumer is engaged and aware of the impact of their purchase. We believe that this consumer centric approach is fundamental in moving towards a more sustainable future and we are collaborating with industry and business groups to find and promote ways to achieve broader adoption of this approach.
Energy: Our products are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws governing energy management or encouraging manufacturers and importers to produce products designed to minimize overall environmental impact.
The effects on Logitech's business of complying with these environmental regulations currently are limited to the cost of agency fees and testing, as well as the time required to obtain agency approvals. There are also stewardship costs associated with the end-of-life collection, recycling and recovery of Logitech products, packaging and batteries where Logitech is recognized as the steward and participates in relevant programs. The costs and schedule requirements are industry requirements and therefore do not represent an undue burden relative to Logitech's competitive position. As regulations change, we will modify our products or processes to address those changes.
Seasonality
Our product sales are typically seasonal. Sales are generally highest during our third fiscal quarter (October to December) primarily due to the increased consumer demand for our products during the year-end holiday buying season and year-end spending by enterprises. Cash flow is correspondingly lower in the first half of our fiscal year as we typically build inventories in advance for the third quarter and we pay an annual dividend following our Annual General Meeting, which is typically in September. Due to the timing of our new product introductions, which could occur at any point during the fiscal year, we believe that year-over-year comparisons are more indicative of variability in our results of operations than the current quarter to prior quarter comparisons.
Materials
We purchase certain products and key components used in our products from a limited number of sources. If the supply of these products or key components, such as micro-controllers and optical sensors, were to be delayed or constrained, or more recently, impacted by global shortages of semiconductor chips, or if one or more of our single-source suppliers go out of business, we might be unable to find a new supplier on acceptable terms, or at all, and our shipments to our customers could be delayed, potentially resulting in lost revenue, market presence and market share. In addition, lead times for materials, components, and products ordered by us or by our contract manufacturers can vary significantly and depend on factors such as contract terms, demand for a component, our ability to forecast product demand, and supplier capacity. From time to time, we have experienced component shortages and extended lead times on semiconductors, such as micro-controllers and optical sensors, and base metals used in our products. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of components or subcontracted products, or our inability to procure these components or products from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could delay shipment of our products or increase our production costs.

Human Capital Resources 
Employees
Our human capital resources include persons employed directly by us or indirectly through contingent workforce arrangements. As of March 31, 2022, we employed approximately 8,200 persons, of which approximately 3,000 were employed, directly and indirectly in our Suzhou manufacturing operations. None of Logitech's U.S. direct employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Certain other countries, such as China, provide by law for employee rights, which include requirements similar to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are good.
We rely on different programs and initiatives to support our goals. Some of our key human capital management programs are summarized below. 
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that reflecting the diverse world in which we live - through our people and by fostering an inclusive culture - provides us with the foundation needed to create experiences that enable all people to pursue their passions, which is our corporate purpose. Our direct employees are located across Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific and bring a range of perspectives and skills to Logitech. As of March 31, 2022, 44% of our office employees were located in Asia-Pacific, 33% in the Americas, and 23% in EMEA. As of March 31, 2022, females represented 37% of our global office employees, 37% of our manufacturing workforce, and 34% were in managerial roles. In the U.S., underrepresented minorities (defined as Black or African American, Asian, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) represented 45% of our workforce, and 43% were in managerial roles.
To foster a more inclusive environment, we offer training sessions to emphasize awareness of self, bias and privilege, and inclusion. In addition, to measure our employees’ satisfaction at Logitech, we distribute a bi-annual employee engagement survey. Most recently, we conducted a survey in December 2021, in which 83% of our global office employees participated. As part of the survey, employees provided weighted feedback on their experience at Logitech, on measures such as happiness, retention and their perspective on our current state of workplace inclusivity at Logitech. 
Safety, Health and Well-being 
We look to safeguard the safety, health and well-being of all members of the Logitech team. We implement training and communication programs across the business each year to ensure employee awareness of the importance of health and safety management and our key programs and provisions. To help us ensure the safety, health and well-being of employees at our production facility in Suzhou, China, we follow the RBA Code of Conduct and have an Environmental, Health and Safety ("EHS") Management System that is certified to ISO 14001 and ISO 45001. We implement the RBA Code as a full supply chain initiative. Further, we operate an audit and verification program to verify compliance with the RBA code. We believe health and well-being are critical to our employee’s personal and professional success and provide, in addition to healthcare benefits, wellness tools, resources and programs designed to help employees achieve good physical, financial, emotional, intellectual and social well-being. 
Further, we have managed the continuing impact of COVID-19 under the guidance of our Corporate Crisis Management Team and in collaboration with our local site leaders and provide regular updates to our board of directors on our actions. During 2021, most of our offices have begun to reopen as and where permitted by local regulations. We are regularly evaluating the local COVID-19 infection rate as a key metric for when we begin to gradually reopen an office. To support our employees during the pandemic and while offices were closed, we offered and continue to offer additional benefits, including a partial internet reimbursement, work-from-home equipment contribution, and increased flexibility in our leave programs to support employees caring for children and others.
Talent Acquisition and Development
Our geographic diversity gives Logitech an excellent foundation to recruit diverse talent from around the world. We believe that the entire talent process must be executed through a lens of equity and inclusion. We provide learning and development tools and resources to all our employees through our key programs. Our talent development program includes a dedicated training center at our production facility, a number of workshop-based,
