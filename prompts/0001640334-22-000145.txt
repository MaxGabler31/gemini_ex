ITEM 1. Business

Mirage Energy Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 6, 2014, as Bridgewater Platforms, Inc. On November 7, 2016, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby it entered into a statutory merger with its wholly owned subsidiary, Mirage Energy Corporation, pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes. The effect of the merger was that the Company is the surviving entity and changed its name to “Mirage Energy Corporation”.

On January 24, 2017, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Michael R. Ward, the sole director of the Company, whereby on the same date the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of its Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of 4Ward Resources. The acquisition was completed on January 24, 2017.

The purpose of acquiring 4Ward Resources was for the Company to enter into the natural gas sale, pipeline, and storage business. The Company intends to develop an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States. 

The Company is in the process of preparing to obtain the necessary permits in Mexico and the United States. 

Mirage, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, intends to develop an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States. Since 2019, Mirage has been working to address the two main impediments affecting private sector companies attempting to enter the Mexico gas market. Presently, Mirage acknowledges a lack of private sector cross-border pipeline access to the Mexico gas markets and a national shortage of Mexico-based natural gas storage facilities and capacity.

Mirage is proposing to develop the Concho-Progreso Pipeline connecting South Texas and Mexico via it proposed Progreso International crossing under the Rio Grande River. All of the pipelines are being revised upward from 36 to 42 inch diameter pipe. The total length of the Concho-Progreso pipeline is estimated to be 250 miles. 

This proposed pipeline includes the following components:

(a) a 7.1 mile 42” bi-directional U.S. pipeline termed the Concho Connector which proposes to tie into the Banquete and Agua Dulce headers;
(b) a 39.1 mile 42” bi-directional U.S. pipeline known as the Concho Extension linking the Concho Connector and its tie-ins to the Company’s Concho line;
(c) a 93.9 mile 42” bi-directional U.S. pipeline known as the Concho Line connecting the Company’s proposed international crossing at Progreso to Transcos’ South Texas mainline near Falfurrias, Texas;
(d) a proposed international crossing termed the Progreso Crossing between Texas and Mexico beneath the Rio Grande River near Progreso, Texas in Hidalgo County to connect to the Concho and Progreso lines;
(e) a 36 mile 42” bi-directional Mexico pipeline termed the Progreso Line connecting to the Company’s proposed Progreso international crossing to Station 19 on Sistrangas; and
(f) a 67 mile 42” bi-directional Mexico pipeline termed the Progreso Extension connecting the Progreso Line to the Los Ramones interconnect on Sistrangas. 

MEXICO UNDER GROUND NATURAL GAS STORAGE:

In addition to the proposed pipelines and international crossing, the Company proposes to develop the Campo Brasil natural gas storage reservoir. Presently, the Campo Brasil is a depleted natural gas reservoir field. Mirage nominated this field in the inaugural tender for Mexico’s strategic reserve on July 25, 2018. This field is located approximately 14 miles from the proposed Progreso Line. This field was not selected by Cenegas during the first selection process. Cenegas has indicated that Mexico intends to develop natural gas storage in the North, Central and Southern regions of Mexico. The Company believes that the Brasil field is the most suitable candidate for development in Northern Mexico.

Mirage believes that the proposed Brasil Storage reservoir will give Mexico the ability to (1) balance peak loads by consumers, (2) implement price arbitrage on natural gas, (3) enable Mexico to create a Mexican natural gas hub for gas pricing thereby giving Mexico an alternative natural gas supply rather than limiting its choice to the natural gas spot market. The Company believes that the planned natural gas storage facility, when fully developed, will give Mexico a secure natural gas supply for approximately one year in the event all gas supplies were shut off from outside sources. We anticipate that the reservoir will have a capacity to store approximately 786 BCF (Billion Cubic Feet) of natural gas.

INTERNATIONAL PIPELINE CROSSING:

PROGRESO CROSSING: The planned Progresso crossing will be subject to a Presidential Permit for boring underneath the Rio Grande River. An approximate 46” bore hole under the river will provide the channel through which the 42” pipe will be pulled. The proposed ownership on US side of river will be held by WPF TRANSMISSION, INC. and on the MEXICO side of the river will be held by WPF MEXICO PIPELINES S. de R.L. de C.V.

On January 28, 2017, 4Ward Resources, Inc., Mirage Energy Corporation’s wholly owned subsidiary, acquired Michael Ward’s ninety (90%) percent interest in two Mexican companies. The remaining ten (10%) percent interest was acquired by Mirage Energy Corporation from Patrick Dosser. Patrick Dosser is Michael Ward’s son.

Together, Mirage Energy and 4Ward Resources own 100% of the two Mexican corporations. The two Mexican corporations are WPF MEXICO PIPELINES, S. de R.L. de C.V., and CENOTE ENERGY S. de R.L. de C.V. Additionally, 4Ward Resources acquired all of Michael Ward’s interest in WPF TRANSMISSION, INC., a Texas corporation.

During 2017, the Company decided to focus all of its efforts on its planned gas pipeline and storage enterprises and therefore sold its subsidiary, Bridgewater Construction, Ltd., to Emanuel Oliveira in exchange for the satisfaction of a debt obligation owed to Mr. Oliveira. The effective date of the transaction was February 1, 2017. 

Current Update

In addition to Mirage’s proposed pipeline and storage projects (the “Projects”), the company is evaluating several other oil and gas opportunities in Southern Mexico which would synergistically integrate with our proposed Projects in Mexico. 
Competition

Proposed Pipeline Operations

Our proposed pipelines face competition from a number of sources, including major oil companies and other common carrier pipelines. Generally, pipelines are the lowest-cost method for long-haul commodity movements. Therefore, the most significant competitors for large volume shipments are other pipelines. 

Competition among pipelines is based primarily on access to commodity supply, market demand, and transportation charges offered for commodity movements. In addition, in areas where additional infrastructure is needed to accommodate production needs, we will compete with other pipeline providers to offer the necessary transportation services to meet market demand. 

In addition to competition from other pipelines, we face competition from trucks and rail that deliver products in a number of areas that we propose to serve. While their costs may not be competitive for longer hauls or large volume shipments, these sources of transportation compete effectively for incremental and marginal volume in many areas where such means of transportation are prevalent.

U.S. GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Safety Regulation

Our planned U.S. pipelines will be subject to United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”) regulations and to regulations under comparable state statutes relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of pipeline facilities.

DOT regulations require operators of hazardous liquid interstate pipelines to develop and follow a program to assess the integrity of all pipeline segments that could affect designated “high consequence areas,” including high population areas, drinking water and ecological resource areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage from a pipeline release, and commercially navigable waterways. We have prepared our own written Integrity Management Program, identified the line segments that could impact high consequence areas, and completed a full assessment of these segments as prescribed by the regulations.

Environmental Regulation

General

Our planned operations will be subject to complex federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment, including laws and regulations which govern the handling and release of hydrocarbon materials, some of which are discussed below. Violations of environmental laws or regulations can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and, in some instances, injunctions banning or delaying certain activities. 

There are will also be risks of accidental hydrocarbon releases into the environment associated with our planned future operations, such as potential releases of hazardous substances from our planned pipelines or storage facility. To the extent an event was not covered by insurance policies, such accidental releases could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from emergency response, environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage, and fines or penalties for any related violations of environmental laws or regulations.

Rate Regulation

General Interstate Regulation

Interstate common carrier pipeline operations are subject to rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under the Interstate Commerce Act, the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and related rules and orders. The Interstate Commerce Act requires that tariff rates for petroleum pipelines be “just and reasonable” and not unduly discriminatory. 

6

Intrastate Regulation

Some of our planned pipeline operations will be subject to regulation by the Railroad Commission of Texas (“Texas RRC”). The applicable state statute will require that our planned pipeline rates be non-discriminatory and provide no more than a fair return on the aggregate value of the pipeline property used to render services. State commissions generally have not initiated an investigation of rates or practices of petroleum pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints. Complaints to state agencies have been infrequent and are usually resolved informally. Although management cannot be certain that our intrastate rates ultimately would be upheld if challenged, we believe that, given this history, the tariffs now in effect are not likely to be challenged or, if challenged, are not likely to be ordered to be reduced.
MEXICO GOVERNMENT REGULATION

In 2013 Mexico commenced its initiative on energy reform. A new legal regulatory framework was instituted by amending Mexico’s Federal Constitution. Mexico’s underlying regulatory laws and administrative regulations continue to be developed in regard to the oil and gas industry. The public policy behind this energy reform is to increase Mexico’s oil and gas production through exploration and extraction contracts, as well as by increasing midstream and downstream infrastructure.

Prior to this reform, all of Mexico’s hydrocarbon activities were reserved to the state-owned company PEMEX. This reform will now permit private companies to participate in the exploration and extraction of gas resources through bidding procedures. All underground hydrocarbons remain the property of Mexico. There is no private ownership of hydrocarbons in Mexico. 

Mexico’s domestic production of natural gas does not meet the national demand. Mexico must import additional natural gas to meets its growing national demand. 

Mirage has proposed to focus its core business development of the midstream infrastructure with its proposed pipelines and storage facility.

Hydrocarbon Regulation

In Mexico, four regulatory bodies are responsible for regulation of hydrocarbon activities. These are (1) the Energy Ministry (SENER), (2) the National Hydrocarbon Commission (CNH), (3) the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE), and (4) the National Agency of Industrial Safety and Environmental Protection of the Hydrocarbons Sector (ASEA).
Natural Gas Regulation

Natural gas activities are supervised and regulated by the CRE and the National Center for Natural Gas Control (CENAGAS). The CRE is the regulatory governmental body that issues permits related to gas activities. Additionally, the CRE supervises and oversees compliance with applicable laws, regulations and official Mexican standards, which includes, but is not limited to tariffs, pipelines and storage operations. CENAGAS was established to manage, administer and operate the National Natural Gas Transportation and Storage System with the view to ensure continuity and safety in natural gas activities throughout Mexico. ASEA supervises the health, safety and environmental protection of all natural gas activities throughout Mexico.
Lease, License, Concession Term

According to the hydrocarbon legal framework rights to oil and gas depend on the particular contractual plan applicable to the particular activities. We expect that our proposed natural gas storage field, if permitted, would be subject to a license contract. 
Taxes and Fees

Taxes and fees payable to Mexico will be governed by the license contract.


7

Liability

The license contract will provide for performing all environmental obligations, commitments and conditions as may be required by applicable law, best industry practices and environmental permits. The contractor will be responsible for all environmental damage.
Restrictions

License contracts may contain restrictions concerning the creation of liens or other ownership encumbrances arising from contracts or materials, the selling or assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any rights or participation interests or other contractual obligations. There may also be restrictions on changes in control of the contracting entity. In many cases, the prior written consent of the CNH may be required.
Title to Properties

None.

Employees

During 2021, the Company had five employees comprised of its two named executive officers, one administrative and two accounting employees.
