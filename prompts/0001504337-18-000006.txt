ITEM 1.    Business
General
Our company, founded in 1973 and headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, is a leading manufacturer of building products. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 5,000 employees. We currently operate 20 modern, strategically located facilities in the U.S. and Canada, two facilities in Chile and one facility in Brazil. We also operate facilities through a joint venture, for which we are the exclusive provider of product distribution for North America. Our products are used primarily in new home construction, repair and remodeling and outdoor structures. We believe that the homebuilding products industry presents significant growth opportunities over the long run, and we intend to continue pursuing these opportunities by delivering innovative, high-quality commodity and specialty building products to retail, wholesale, homebuilding and industrial customers. We utilize various tools, such as an enterprise resource planning system and Lean Six Sigma, to improve operational efficiency and productivity. 
Our Overall Strategies
Continue to Grow Market Share and Capitalize on Strength in New Home Construction. We continue to strategically invest in our operations with the goal of maximizing profitability as the new home construction and repair and remodeling markets continue to strengthen. We believe the initiatives implemented and investments we have made during the past few years, and which we continue to make, have strengthened our market position and enhanced our ability to capture significant cash flow growth from continued improvement in the end markets we serve. We have also focused our sales and marketing efforts with the purpose of generating more sales of our products per housing start. 
Generate Value Added Sales Growth through Customer Focus and Innovation. Our marketing efforts target builders, industrial manufacturers and major home improvement retailers and focus on the features of our products. Our sales efforts target customers by channel and focus on providing these customers with quality service and a broad array of traditional and specialty building products. We continue to grow our high value add products to provide growing stable margins. Our facilities are strategically located in the United States, Canada and South America, allowing us to be closer to our customers and more responsive to end-user needs and trends. We prioritize quality service and continue to enhance our reputation for accurate deliveries on a timely basis. In addition, we continually seek to identify new specialty building products and markets where we can utilize our core competencies in the design, manufacturing and marketing of building products.
Continue to Grow Our Siding Segment and Expand Internationally in Order to Diversify Revenue Mix. We believe that we are currently the leading producer of treated engineered wood siding and, therefore, are poised to benefit from demand growth as it continues to displace alternative siding materials such as vinyl, wood and other materials. Furthermore, this segment is less sensitive to new housing market cyclicality as over 50% of its demand comes from other markets including sheds, retail and the repair and remodeling end market. Our investments in South America will help us continue to satisfy the growing demand for structural panels in South America to support the growth of affordable housing. This growth in the Siding and South American segments will continue to diversify our revenue mix.
Improve Operating Efficiencies and Continue Focus on Cost Reductions and Portfolio Optimization.     We have improved and continue to lower the cost structure of our facilities through our Lean Six Sigma efforts and the sale or closure of underperforming mills and manufacturing facilities, as well as investing in technology. Our Lean Six Sigma efforts continue to produce excellent returns from cost-savings and efficiency projects across our organization. We have also structured our management teams along product lines to enhance our ability to implement best manufacturing practices across operations. Given these initiatives and the strategic locations of many of our facilities, we believe that we are one of the lowest average delivered-cost producers of oriented strand board (OSB) in North America. We also employ a strategy of curtailing production at selected facilities, when appropriate, in order to meet customer demand, and optimize our portfolio and margins. As market conditions 
 2

continue to change and improve, we plan to adapt our product mix, selectively invest in new technologies that modernize our manufacturing facilities, and develop improved manufacturing processes in order to enhance the quality and consistency of our earnings. 
Pursue Selected Strategic Transactions. We evaluate on an ongoing basis various opportunities to participate in acquisitions of assets, businesses and activities that are complementary, and other strategic business combination transactions. We believe that our pursuit of these opportunities, if successful, could enable us to increase the size and scope of our businesses or joint ventures. 
Business Segments
We operate in four segments: Siding; North America Oriented Strand Board (OSB); Engineered Wood Products (EWP); and South America. In general, our business results are affected by the level of housing starts; the level of home repairs; changes in industry capacity; changes in the prices we pay for raw materials and energy, and changes in foreign exchange rates (primarily the Canadian dollar, Chilean Peso and Brazilian Real).
Siding
Our Siding segment consists of LP SmartSide® trim and siding, LP CanExel® prefinished siding, as well as LP Outdoor Building Solutions® innovative products for premium outdoor buildings. Our SmartSide® products consist of a full line of wood-based sidings, trim, soffit and fascia. These products have quality and performance characteristics similar to solid wood at more attractive prices due to lower raw material and production costs. Our CanExel® siding and accessory product offerings include a number of pre-finished lap and trim products in a variety of patterns and textures. These products are used in new construction, repair and remodeling and outdoor structures such as sheds. We believe we are the largest producer of engineered wood siding. We believe we operate in diverse end markets with stable pricing.
Our strategy is to drive product innovation by utilizing our technological expertise in wood and wood composites to better address the needs of our customers. We intend to increase our product offerings and production capacity of higher margin, value-added products through the addition of lower cost plants or the conversion of OSB plants from commodity structural panel production to OSB-based exterior siding products.
Additionally, some amounts of OSB are produced and sold in this segment.
OSB
Our OSB segment manufactures and distributes OSB structural panel products including LP OSB, LP TechShield® radiant barrier, LP TopNotch® sub-flooring, LP Legacy® super tough, moisture-resistant sub-flooring and LP FlameBlock® fire-rated sheathing.
OSB is an innovative, affordable and environmentally friendly product made from wood strands arranged in layers and bonded with resin. OSB serves many of the same uses as plywood, including roof decking, sidewall sheathing and floor underlayment, but can be produced at a significantly lower cost. It is estimated for 2017 that OSB accounted for approximately 67% of the structural panel consumption in North America with plywood accounting for the remainder. We estimate that the overall North American structural panel market (based upon 2017 housing starts) was 34.6 billion square feet with the OSB market comprising an estimated 23.2 billion square feet of this market. Based upon our production in 2017 of 4.7 billion square feet (including OSB produced in our siding and EWP segments), we estimate that we account for 20% of the North American OSB market and 13% of the overall North American structural panel market. During 2017, our volume percentage of value-added OSB was 38% as compared to 34% in 2016. We believe we are a leading producer of commodity and value-added OSB in North America and are positioned to compete in all geographic markets. 
To enhance our industry leading position in the OSB business, we plan to: (1) leverage our expertise in OSB to capitalize on new opportunities for revenue growth through value-added product lines; (2) deliver superior quality 
 3

and service; (3) reduce costs and improve throughput and recovery by continuing to focus on efficiency, raw materials cost reductions and logistics; and (4) manage our capacity to meet our customers' expected needs for OSB.
Engineered Wood Products
Our EWP segment is comprised of LP SolidStart® I-Joist (IJ), Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) and Laminated Strand Lumber (LSL) and other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist produced by our joint venture with Resolute Forest Products and LVL sold under a contract manufacturing arrangement. We believe that in North America, we are one of the top three producers (including our joint venture production) of I-Joists, LVL and LSL. A plywood mill associated with our LVL operations in British Columbia and minor amounts of OSB are also included in this segment. We believe that our engineered I-joists, which are used primarily in residential and commercial flooring and roofing systems and other structural applications, are stronger, lighter and straighter than conventional lumber joists. Our LVL and LSL are high-grade, value-added structural products used in applications where extra strength and quality is required, such as headers and beams. 
Our strategy is to strengthen our brand name recognition in the EWP market by enhancing our product mix and quality, providing superior technical support to our customers and leveraging our sales and marketing relationships to cross-sell our EWP products. Additionally, we are seeking to drive costs down by rationalizing our production capacity across geographic areas and improving operating efficiencies in our manufacturing facilities.
South America
Our South American segment manufactures and distributes OSB and siding products in South America and certain export markets. This segment also distributes and sells related products to augment the transition to wood frame construction. We believe we are the only producer of OSB and siding in South America. We believe we are positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for wood-based residential construction in South America.
Other Products
Our other products category includes our remaining timber and timberlands, and other minor products, services and closed or idled operations. 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Our sales and marketing efforts are primarily focused on traditional two-step distribution, professional building products dealers, home centers, third-party wholesale buying groups and other retailers. The wholesale distribution channel includes a variety of specialized and broad-line wholesale distributors and dealers focused primarily on the supply of products for use by professional builders and contractors. The retail distribution channel includes large retail chains catering to the do-it-yourself (DIY) and repair and remodeling markets as well as smaller independent retailers.
Customers
We seek to maintain a broad customer base and a balanced approach to national distribution through both wholesale and retail channels. In 2017, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 46% of our sales. Our principal customers include the following:

• | Wholesale distribution companies, which supply building materials to retailers on a regional, state or local basis;


• | Two-step distributors, who provide building materials to smaller retailers, contractors and others;


• | Building materials professional dealers, that specialize in sales to professional builders, remodeling firms and trade contractors that are involved in residential home construction and light commercial building;


• | Retail home centers, that provide access to consumer markets with a broad selection of home improvement materials and increasingly serve professional builders, remodelers DIY, and trade contractors; and

 4


• | Shed producers, who design, construct and distribute prefabricated residential and light commercial structures, including fully manufactured, modular and panelized structures, for consumer and professional markets.

Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal variances, with demand for many of our products tending to be greater during the building season, which generally occurs in the second and third quarters in North America and the fourth and first quarters in South America. From time to time, we engage in promotional activities designed to stimulate demand for our products, such as reducing our selling prices and providing extended payment terms, particularly at times when demand is otherwise relatively soft. We do this in an effort to better balance our inventory levels with demand, manage the logistics of our product shipments, allow our production facilities to run efficiently, be competitive, and/or obtain initial orders from customers.
Competitors / Competition
The building products industry is highly competitive. We compete internationally with several thousand forest and building products firms, ranging from very large, fully integrated firms to smaller enterprises that may manufacture only one or a few items. We also compete less directly with firms that manufacture substitutes for wood building products. Some competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do that could, in some instances, give them a competitive advantage over us.
In terms of our commodity OSB, we compete based upon price, quality and availability of products. In terms of our specialty products, including EWP, Siding and various value added OSB products, we compete based upon price, quality, and availability of products as well as performance features offered.
Raw Materials
Wood fiber is the primary raw material used in most of our operations, and the primary source of wood fiber is timber. The primary end-markets for timber harvested in the North America are manufacturers who supply: (1) the housing market, where it is used in the construction of new housing and the repair and remodeling of existing housing; (2) the pulp and paper market; (3) commercial and industrial markets; (4) export markets; and (5) emerging biomass energy production markets. The supply of timber is limited by the availability of timberlands and access to the fiber. The availability of timberlands, in turn, is limited by several factors, including forest management policies, alternate uses of land, and loss to urban or suburban real estate development. Because wood fiber is subject to commodity pricing, the cost of various types of timber that we purchase in the market has at times fluctuated greatly due to weather, governmental regulations / restrictions, economic or other industry conditions. However, our mills are generally in close proximity to large and diverse supplies of timber and have the ability to procure wood fiber at competitive prices.
In addition to wood fiber, we use significant quantities of various resins in our manufacturing processes. Resin product costs are influenced by changes in the prices of raw materials used to produce resin, primarily petroleum products and energy, as well as competing demand for resin products. Currently, we purchase the majority of our resin from three major suppliers and believe our relationships with those suppliers are good. However, there can be no assurance that pricing or availability of resins will not be impacted based upon competing demand.
While a large portion of our energy requirements are met at our plants through the energy produced from the conversion of wood waste, we also purchase substantial amounts of energy in our operations, primarily electricity and natural gas. Energy prices have experienced significant volatility in recent years, particularly in deregulated markets. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to energy price changes through the selective use of long-term supply agreements.

Environmental Compliance / Climate Change
Our operations are subject to many environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, the discharge of pollutants and other emissions on or into land, water and air, the disposal of hazardous substances or other contaminants, the remediation of contamination and the restoration and reforestation of timberlands. In addition, certain environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners, operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can significantly increase the costs of our operations. In some cases, plant closures can result in more onerous compliance requirements becoming applicable to a facility or a site. Violations of environmental laws and regulations can subject us to additional costs and expenses, including defense costs and expenses and civil and criminal penalties. We cannot assure you that the environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject will not become more stringent, or be more stringently implemented or enforced, in the future.
Changes in global or regional climate conditions and current or future governmental response to such changes at the international, U.S. federal and state levels, such as regulating and/or taxing the production of carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gases” to facilitate the reduction of emissions into the atmosphere, and/or the imposition of taxes or other incentives to produce and use “cleaner” energy, may increase energy costs, limit harvest levels and impact our operations or our planned or future growth activities. Because our manufacturing operations depend upon significant amounts of energy and raw materials, these initiatives could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability. Future legislation or regulatory activity in this area remains uncertain, and the impact on our operations is unclear at this time.
Our policy is to comply fully with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. We devote significant management attention to achieving full compliance. In addition, from time to time, we undertake construction projects for environmental control equipment or incur other environmental costs that extend an asset’s useful life, improve its efficiency or improve the marketability of certain properties.
Additional information concerning environmental matters is set forth under item 3, Legal Proceedings, and in Note 19 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.
Employees
We employ approximately 5,000 people, about 952 of whom are members of unions, primarily in Canada, Chile and Brazil. We consider our relationship with our employees generally to be good. While we do not currently anticipate any work stoppages, there can be no assurance that work stoppages will not occur.
