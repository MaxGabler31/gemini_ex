GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COMPANY
 

Medicale Corp (“we,” “our” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 17, 2020. To date we have not generated revenue from our business operations. Furthermore, as we are still in the early stages of developing our business and expect to operate at a loss as we grow our business. There is little historical financial information about our Company upon which to base an evaluation of our performance or to make a decision regarding an investment in our shares. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations or that we will achieve significant, if any, level of market acceptance for our proposed business operations and products. Our business could be subject to any or all of the problems, expenses, delays and risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible changes in consumer interest, possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services or products we require.
 
We have never been subject to any bankruptcy proceeding. Our principal executive offices are located at Otar Lortkifanidze 16, Tbilisi, Georgia, 0114. Our phone number is +17026054432.
 
The Company offers consulting services and distribution of the dietary supplements. A dietary supplement is a manufactured product intended to supplement the diet when taken by mouth as a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid. A supplement can provide nutrients either extracted from food sources or synthetic, individually or in combination, in order to increase the quantity of their consumption. The class of nutrient compounds includes vitamins, minerals, fiber, fatty acids and amino acids. Dietary supplements can also contain substances that have not been confirmed as being essential to life, but are marketed as having a beneficial biological effect, such as plant pigments or polyphenols. Animals can also be a source of supplement ingredients, as for example collagen from chickens or fish. 
 
We intend to buy all dietary supplements on wholesale and resell them around the Georgia via our internet platform. Our website address is: http://medicalecorp.com. The site provides different variants of products, such as: vitamins, minerals, proteins and amino acids, essential fatty acids, probiotics and other products, as well as direct contact with our company for consulting services.
