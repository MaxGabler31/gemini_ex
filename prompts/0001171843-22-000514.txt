Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 
We operate in the gold mining industry, primarily focused on advancing the Donlin Gold project in Alaska. The Donlin Gold project is held by Donlin Gold LLC (“Donlin Gold”), a limited liability company owned equally by wholly-owned subsidiaries of NOVAGOLD and Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick”).
 
We do not produce gold or any other minerals, and do not currently generate operating earnings. Funding to explore our mineral properties and to operate the Company was acquired primarily through previous equity financings consisting of public offerings of our common shares and warrants and through debt financing consisting of convertible notes, and the sale of assets. We expect to continue to raise capital through additional equity and/or debt financings, through the exercise of stock options, and otherwise.
 
We were incorporated by memorandum of association on December 5, 1984, under the Companies Act (Nova Scotia) as 1562756 Nova Scotia Limited. On January 14, 1985, we changed our name to NovaCan Mining Resources (l985) Limited and on March 20, 1987, we changed our name to NOVAGOLD RESOURCES INC. On May 29, 2013, our shareholders approved the continuance of the corporation into British Columbia. Subsequently, we filed the necessary documents in Nova Scotia and British Columbia, and we continued under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) effective as of June 10, 2013. The current addresses, telephone and facsimile numbers of our offices are:

Human Capital Resources
 
On November 30, 2021, we had 14 full-time employees, of which four are located in Canada and ten are located in the United States. We also use consultants with specific skills to assist with various aspects of project evaluation, engineering, and corporate governance.
Company Values 
 
Our company culture is the cornerstone of all our human capital programs. Empowering every employee to be their best, affording every employee the opportunity to make a difference, and giving every employee a chance to be heard are core Company values. Our values extend to the communities in which we work. We have adopted a Human Rights Policy focused on our commitment to having a positive influence in the communities where we operate which includes ensuring that we respect human rights.
Diversity 
 
As of the end of fiscal year 2021, 43% of our total workforce were women. Selection of individuals for executive and other positions with the Company is guided by the Company’s policy which “prohibits discrimination in any aspect of employment based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or age.” Our Board and management acknowledge the importance of all aspects of diversity including gender, ethnic origin, business skills and experience, because it is right to do so and because it is good for our business. When considering candidates for executive positions, the Board’s evaluation considers the broadest possible assessment of each candidate’s skills and background with the overriding objective of ensuring that we have the appropriate balance of skills, experience, and capacity that the Company needs to be successful. In the context of this overriding objective, we have determined not to set targets for the percentage of women, or other aspects of diversity, in executive officer positions.
 
NOVAGOLD is committed to fostering, cultivating, and preserving a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. Our employees are one of the most valuable assets we have. The collective sum of the individual differences, life experiences, knowledge, inventiveness, innovation, self-expression, unique capabilities, and talent that our employees invest in their work represents a significant part of our culture, reputation, and NOVAGOLD’s achievements.
 
NOVAGOLD is dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives, and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. NOVAGOLD strives to foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and sustain an inclusive workplace.
 
NOVAGOLD’s diversity initiatives are applicable—but not limited—to our practices and policies on recruitment and selection; compensation and benefits; professional development and training; promotions; and the ongoing development of a work environment built on the premise of gender and diversity equity. To that end, we seek out qualified diverse candidates to encourage them to apply for open positions, either from within or outside of the company. We also seek out opportunities to develop a pipeline of qualified diverse candidates in a particular profession when we are unable to find them ourselves.
 
We encourage:
 

● | Respectful communication and cooperation among all employees.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Teamwork and employee participation, fostering the representation of all employee perspectives.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Work/life balance through flexible work schedules to accommodate employees’ varying needs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Learning about and, where appropriate, providing assistance in the communities near NOVAGOLD’s projects to promote a greater understanding and respect for diversity in those communities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In 2021, the Company established and funded the NOVAGOLD Mining and Geological Engineering Scholarship at the University of Alaska to help support and encourage undergraduate students seeking bachelor’s degrees in Mining or Geological Engineering, with a focus on supporting underrepresented students.
 
Safety and Health
 
NOVAGOLD’s primary objective is to ensure the health and safety of its employees, partners, and contractors, and is reflected in its Health and Safety Policy. The Company has implemented COVID-19 policies at its offices in Salt Lake City and Vancouver designed to ensure the safety and well-being of all employees and the people associated with them. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, to reduce risk, our employees have been encouraged to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, have been asked to work remotely, avoid all non-essential travel, adhere to good hygiene practices, and engage in physical distancing. Our focus on safety is also reflected at Donlin Gold where a wide-ranging set of policies were implemented at the Donlin Gold project site and Anchorage office to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Also see section Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.

Recent Developments
 
The Company has elected to early adopt the mining disclosure standards of Subpart 229.1300 of Regulation S-K – Disclosure by Registrants Engaged in Mining Operations (“S-K 1300”). The Company will be subject to and required to disclose mineral resources and mineral reserves in accordance with S-K 1300. While the S-K 1300 rules are similar to National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) rules in Canada, they are not identical and therefore two reports have been produced for the Donlin Gold project. The information in Item 2, Properties, below is common to both reports and contains pertinent information required under S-K 1300.
 
Donlin Gold Technical Report (NI 43-101)
 
The Company retained Wood Canada Limited (“Wood”) to update content in its previously filed “Donlin Creek Gold Project, Alaska, USA, NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Second Updated Feasibility Study,” effective November 18, 2011, and amended January 20, 2012 (“2011 Mining Study”). Wood completed an exercise to verify which content in the 2011 Mining Study remains current, and what was required to update the report content with the latest information. Updated content includes operating costs, capital costs, tax rates, long term gold price, and the economic analysis. Additionally, work done on the property since 2011 with respect to exploration, drilling, permitting, and minor mine design changes as a result of recent permitting activities are summarized in the updated content. A data verification exercise was completed by each Wood Qualified Person (“QP”) co-authoring the report. This included a September 2020 site visit by two of the report QPs; review of the geologic data, geologic model, and resource model; review of metallurgical test work; review of designs for mining, processing, and infrastructure, including minor design updates; update of capital and operating cost estimates utilizing a combination of cost indices and vendor quotations; and an updated economic analysis. Canadian NI 43-101 Definitions and CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (“CIM Definition Standards”), adopted by CIM Council on May 10, 2014 apply for this exercise.
 
The Wood review determined that the report updating exercise resulted in no material change to the Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves. On August 31, 2021, the Company voluntarily filed an updated NI 43-101 technical report for the Donlin Gold project in Alaska, USA, and titled “NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Donlin Gold Project, Alaska, USA,” with an effective date of June 1, 2021 (“2021 Technical Report”) reflecting the results of the above exercise. The 2021 Technical Report was prepared by Wood and the following contributors, each of whom is a QP under NI 43-101: Henry Kim, P.Geo., Senior Resource Geologist, Wood Canada Limited; Mike Woloschuk, P.Eng., VP Global Business Development & Consulting, Wood Group USA, Inc.; and Kirk Hanson, MBA, P.E., Technical Director, Open Pit Mining, Wood Group USA, Inc. The 2021 Technical Report is available on the Company’s website and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
 
Donlin Gold Technical Report Summary (S-K 1300)
 
The Company is a registrant with the SEC and is reporting its exploration results, Mineral Resources, and Mineral Reserves using the mining disclosure standards of S-K 1300. The Company requested that Wood Canada Limited (“Wood”) prepare a Technical Report Summary of the Donlin Gold project, Alaska, USA using the standards of S-K 1300 and it is titled “S-K 1300 Technical Report Summary on the Donlin Gold Project, Alaska, USA” (“S-K 1300 Report”), current as of November 30, 2021, with a report date of November 30, 2021. Wood prepared the S-K 1300 Report from the 2011 Mining Study of the Donlin deposits that was completed to at least pre-feasibility level, as defined by S-K 1300, at the time of the study. Material aspects of the 2011 Mining Study were updated by Wood in 2020 and made current. As part of the update process, Wood’s subject matter experts completed an exercise to verify and update the content of the 2011 Mining Study with the latest information under the supervision of Wood’s independent QP co-authors of the S-K 1300 Report. Updated content includes operating costs, capital costs, taxes, forecast long term gold price and the economic analysis. Additionally, work done since 2011 on the property with respect to exploration, drilling, permitting and minor project design changes as a result of recent permitting activities are summarized in the S-K 1300 Report. A data verification exercise was completed by each Wood QP co-authoring the S-K 1300 Report. Wood QPs verified that the updated content of the 2011 Mining Study met at least pre-feasibility level of study as defined in S-K 1300, and it supports the disclosure of exploration results, Mineral Resources, and Mineral Reserves using S-K 1300 standards.
Results of the Donlin Gold Technical Report (NI 43-101) and Donlin Gold Technical Report Summary (S-K 1300)
 
Wood reviewed the geologic and resource models that supported the 2011 Mining Study, including comparing them to data from recent drilling programs, and determined that they continue to be adequate and suitable to be used for a Mineral Resource estimation. Using updated cost inputs from the first calendar quarter of 2020, a gold price of $1,500 per ounce, and the geologic and resource models utilized in support of the 2011 Mining Study, the contents within an updated optimized pit shell did not show a material change to the Mineral Resources stated in the 2011 Mining Study. Therefore, the Mineral Resources are considered current as of November 30, 2021 and are unchanged. They continue to have an effective date of July 11, 2011.

Similarly, using updated cost inputs, a gold price of $1,200 per ounce, and the geologic and resource models utilized in support of the 2011 Mining Study with appropriate modifying factors applied for Mineral Reserve estimation, the previous Mineral Reserve ultimate pit was contained within an updated optimized pit shell. Therefore, the Mineral Reserves remain current as of November 30, 2021 and are unchanged. Because the Mineral Reserves are supported by an updated economic analysis they have an effective date of April 27, 2021.
 
Outside of verifying the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates, the primary efforts in the 2021 Technical Report and the S-K 1300 Report were financial and permitting updates. This includes updates to estimated capital costs, operating costs, reclamation and closure costs, royalties, taxes, and economic analysis, as well as current status of the permits. Updated capital costs are based on first calendar quarter 2020 pricing (cost indices and current commodity pricing and equipment quotes) applied to the engineering designs and material take-offs from the 2011 Mining Study, except for minor changes made during permitting in the operations water treatment plant and the natural gas pipeline. As a result of the content updates, the total initial capital cost estimate is $7,402 million, which is an increase of 10.8% or $723 million compared to the 2011 Mining Study total initial capital cost estimate. Likewise, the total sustaining capital estimate is $1,723 million, which is an increase of 14.6% or $219 million compared to the 2011 Mining Study total sustaining capital estimate. The 2011 Mining Study operating costs were updated to first calendar quarter 2020 by updating key cost drivers like energy, labor, consumables, and freight. No material changes to project designs, schedules, or productivities were made; consequently, the manning schedules and consumables remain unchanged. The updated estimated LOM operating costs total $19,289 million, which is $5.90/t mined, $38.21/t processed, or $635/oz gold sold.
 
The economic evaluation of the Donlin Gold project in both the 2021 Technical Report and the S-K 1300 Report was updated using the following inputs:
 

● | A production plan based on the 2011 Mining Study of 53,500 t/d open pit gold mine with ore processing by means of flotation, pressure oxidation, and cyanidation. The pit designs and Mineral Reserves were based on the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource estimates that were verified as remaining current. Annual LOM gold production averages 1.13 million ounces per year over a production life of 27 years, including 1.46 million ounces per year for the first five full years of production.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | $1,500/oz gold price
--+---------------------


● | Current land and royalty agreements
--+------------------------------------


● | Initial and sustaining capital costs, and operating costs updated to first calendar quarter 2020
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tax payments in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) enacted in December 2017 and effective January 1, 2018
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | $292 million LOM contributions for reclamation, closure, and financial assurance
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Financing has been assumed on a 100%, all equity, stand-alone basis
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Escalation/inflation has been excluded
--+---------------------------------------


● | No salvage is assumed at the end of operations
--+-----------------------------------------------

 
Based on the economic evaluation, the Donlin Gold project generates positive before and after-tax economic results. Total after-tax cash flow is $13,145 million, after-tax NPV at a 5% discount rate is $3,040 million, and the after-tax internal rate of return is 9.2%. After-tax payback is achieved 7.3 years following the start of production.
 
Donlin Gold project
 
In 2021, Donlin Gold completed a 79-hole drilling program totaling approximately 24,264 meters in both the ACMA and Lewis deposit areas. The primary objective of the program was to validate recent geologic modeling concepts and test for extensions of high-grade zones in both intrusive (igneous) and sedimentary rocks. Assays are pending and will be disclosed in 2022.
 
For further information, see section Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.
 
Reclamation
 
We will generally be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which are approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. In addition, financial assurance acceptable to the regulatory authority with jurisdiction over reclamation must be provided in an amount that the authority determines to be sufficient to allow the authority to implement the approved reclamation plan in the event that the project owners fail to complete the work as provided in the plan.

Government and Environmental Regulations
 
Our exploration and development activities are subject to various national, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances, disclosure requirements and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration and development programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations in the United States. There are no current orders or directions relating to us with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations. For a more detailed discussion of the various government laws and regulations applicable to our operations and potential negative effects of these laws and regulations, see section Item 1A, Risk Factors, below.
 
Competition
 
We compete with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing, technical expertise, and the acquisition of mineral properties. Many of the companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on the acquisition, exploration, and development of mineral properties. This competition could adversely impact our ability to finance further exploration and to obtain the financing necessary for us to develop the Donlin Gold project.
Availability of Raw Materials and Skilled Employees
 
Most aspects of our business require specialized skills and knowledge. Such skills and knowledge include the areas of geology, drilling, resource estimating, metallurgy, mine planning, logistical planning, preparation of pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, permitting, engineering, construction and operation of a mine, financing, legal, accounting, investor relations, and community relations. Historically, we have found that we can locate and retain appropriate employees and consultants and we believe we will continue to be able to do so.
 
The raw materials we require to carry on our business are readily available through normal supply or business contracting channels in the United States and Canada. Historically, we have been able to secure the appropriate equipment and supplies required to conduct our contemplated programs. As a result, we do not believe that we will experience any shortages of required equipment or supplies in the foreseeable future.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business can be seasonal as our mineral exploration and development activities take place in southwestern Alaska. Due to the northern climate, work on the Donlin Gold project can be limited due to excessive snow cover and cold temperatures. In general, surface work often is limited to late spring through early fall, although work in some locations is more readily and efficiently completed during the winter months when the ground is frozen.
Gold Price History
 
The price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, changes in global and regional gold demand, in addition to international and national political and economic conditions.
