Item 1. | Business Overview
--------+------------------

 
Fennec Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Fennec,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of PEDMARKTM (a unique formulation of Sodium Thiosulfate (“STS”)) for the prevention of platinum-induced ototoxicity in pediatric cancer patients. We incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act ("CBCA”) in September 1996. Effective on August 25, 2011, the Company continued from the Canada Business Corporations Act to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the “Continuance”). The Continuance was approved by the shareholders of Fennec at the Company's June 2011 Annual and Special Meeting and by resolution of the Board of Directors on August 10, 2011. We have three wholly-owned subsidiaries: Oxiquant, Inc. and Fennec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., both Delaware corporations, and Cadherin Biomedical Inc., a Canadian company. With the exception of Fennec Pharmaceuticals, Inc., all subsidiaries are inactive.
 
On December 12, 2017, the Company announced the completion of an underwritten public offering of 2,352,950 common shares at a public offering price of $8.50 per share. In addition, Fennec issued an additional 135,670 common shares in connection with the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. The approximate total gross proceeds from the offering was $21.2 million.
 
On June 8, 2017, the Company completed the closing of a non-brokered private placement (the “Offering”) of 1,900,000 common shares for gross proceeds of $7.6 million. Each common share was issued at a price of $4.00.
 
Lead Product Candidate
 
The following is our only lead product candidate in the clinical stage of development:
 
· | PEDMARKTM (a unique formulation of sodium thiosulfate (STS)) – sodium thiosulfate in a novel formulation, recently announced results of two Phase III clinical trials for the prevention of cisplatin induced hearing loss, or ototoxicity in children including the pivotal Phase III study SIOPEL 6 , “A Multicentre Open Label Randomised Phase 3 Trial of the Efficacy of Sodium Thiosulfate in Reducing Ototoxicity in Patients Receiving Cisplatin Chemotherapy for Standard Risk Hepatoblastoma,” and the proof of concept Phase III study “A Randomized Phase 3 Study of Sodium Thiosulfate for the Prevention of Cisplatin-Induced Ototoxicity in Children”.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We continue to focus the Company’s resources on the development of PEDMARKTM.
 
PEDMARKTM
 We have licensed from Oregon Health & Science University (“OHSU”) intellectual property rights for the use of PEDMARKTM as a chemoprotectant, and are developing PEDMARKTM as a protectant against the hearing loss often caused by platinum-based anti-cancer agents in children. Preclinical and clinical studies conducted by OHSU and others have indicated that PEDMARKTM can effectively reduce the incidence of hearing loss caused by platinum-based anti-cancer agents. We have received Orphan Drug Designation in the United States for the use of PEDMARKTM in the prevention of platinum-induced ototoxicity in pediatric patients.

Hearing loss among children receiving platinum-based chemotherapy is frequent, permanent and often severely disabling. The incidence of hearing loss in these children depends upon the dose and duration of chemotherapy, and many of these children require lifelong hearing aids. There is currently no established preventive agent for this hearing loss and only expensive, technically difficult and sub-optimal cochlear (inner ear) implants have been shown to provide some benefit. In addition, adults undergoing chemotherapy for several common malignancies, including ovarian cancer, testicular cancer, and particularly head and neck cancer and brain cancer, often receive intensive platinum-based therapy and may experience severe, irreversible hearing loss, particularly in the high frequencies.
 
The Company estimates based on data from Childhood and Adolescent Cancer Statistics (2014) and Automated Childhood Cancer Information System (ACCIS) that the annual incidence of pediatric solid tumor cases eligible for Platinum-Based therapy collectively in American and European markets is greater than 10,000.
 
Investigators at OHSU have conducted Phase I and Phase II studies which have shown that STS reduces the hearing loss associated with platinum-based chemotherapy. In one study at OHSU, the need for hearing aids to correct high frequency hearing loss was reduced from about 50% of patients being administered platinum-based chemotherapy to less than 5% of patients being administered platinum-based chemotherapy with STS.
 
STS has been studied by cooperative groups in two Phase III clinical studies of survival and reduction of ototoxicity, the Clinical Oncology Group (“COG”) Protocol ACCL0431 and the International Society of Pediatric Oncology (“SIOPEL 6”). The COG Protocol ACCL0431 enrolled one of five childhood cancers typically treated with intensive cisplatin therapy for localized and disseminated disease, including newly diagnosed hepatoblastoma, germ cell tumor, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and medulloblastoma/PNET. SIOPEL 6 enrolled only hepatoblastoma patients with localized tumors.
 
In 2018, Fennec plans to pursue regulatory approval for PEDMARKTM based on the data from the pivotal SIOPEL 6 study along with the proof of principle data from COG ACCL0431. STS has received Orphan Drug Designation in the US in this setting and plans to pursue European Market Exclusivity for Pediatric Use ("PUMA") upon approval. Orphan Drug Designation will allow for 7.5 years of market exclusivity and PUMA will allow for 10 years of market exclusivity.
 
SIOPEL 6
 
In October 2007, we announced that our collaborative partner, the International Childhood Liver Tumour Strategy Group, known as SIOPEL, a multi-disciplinary group of specialists under the umbrella of the International Society of Pediatric Oncology, had launched a randomized Phase III clinical trial SIOPEL 6 to investigate whether STS reduces hearing loss in standard risk hepatoblastoma (liver) cancer patients receiving cisplatin as a monotherapy.
 
The study was initiated in October 2007 initially in the United Kingdom and completed enrollment at the end of 2014. 52 sites from 11 countries enrolled 109 evaluable patients. Under the terms of our agreement, SIOPEL conducts and funds all clinical activities and Fennec provides drug, drug distribution and pharmacovigilance, or safety monitoring, for the study. SIOPEL 6 was completed in December 2014 and the results of the trial were released in October 2017 at SIOP 2017.
 
The primary objectives of SIOPEL 6 are:
 
· | To assess the efficacy of STS to reduce the hearing impairment caused by cisplatin.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | To carefully monitor any potential impact of STS on response to cisplatin and survival.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SIOPEL 6 - Results - October 2017
 
Background / Objectives:
 
Background: Bilateral high-frequency hearing loss is a serious permanent side-effect of cisplatin therapy, particularly debilitating when occurring in young children. STS has been shown to reduce cisplatin induced hearing loss. SIOPEL 6 is a phase III randomized trial to assess the efficacy of STS in reducing ototoxicity in young children treated with cisplatin (Cis) for Standard Risk Hepatoblastoma (SR-HB).
Design / Methods:
 
Methods: Newly diagnosed patients with SR-HB, defined as tumour limited to PRETEXT I, II or III, no portal or hepatic vein involvement, no intra-abdominal extrahepatic disease, AFP >100ng/ml and no metastases, were randomized to Cis or Cis+STS for 4 preoperative and 2 postoperative courses. Cisplatin 80mg/m2 was administered over 6 hours, STS 20g/m2 was administered intravenously over 15 minutes exactly 6 hours after stopping cisplatin. Tumour response was assessed after 2 and 4 preoperative cycles with serum AFP and liver imaging. In case of progressive disease (PD), STS was to be stopped and doxorubicin 60mg/m2 combined with cisplatin.  The primary endpoint is centrally reviewed absolute hearing threshold, at the age of ≥3.5 years by pure tone audiometry.

Results:
 
Results: One hundred and nine randomized patients (52 Cisplatin only ("Cis") and 57 Cis+STS) are evaluable. The combination of Cis+STS was generally well tolerated. With a follow up time of 52 months for the patients the 3 year Event Free Survival ("EFS") for Cis is 78.8% Cisplatin and 82.1% for the Cis + STS. The 3 year Overall Survival ("OS") is 92.3% for Cis and 98.2% for Cis + STS. Treatment failure defined as Progressive Disease ("PD") at 4 cycles was equivalent in both arms. Among the first 99 evaluable patients, hearing loss occurred in 30/45=67.0% under Cis and in 20/54=37.0% under Cis +STS, corresponding to a relative risk of 0.56(P=0.0033).
Conclusions:
 
This randomized phase III trial in SR-HB of cisplatin versus cisplatin plus sodium thiosulfate shows that the addition of sodium thiosulfate significantly reduces the incidence of cisplatin-induced hearing loss without any evidence of tumour protection.
COG ACCL0431
 In March 2008, we announced the activation of a Phase III trial with STS to prevent hearing loss in children receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy in collaboration with the Children’s Oncology Group (“COG ACCL0431”). The goal of this Phase III study was to evaluate in a multi-centered, randomized trial whether STS is an effective and safe means of preventing hearing loss in children receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy for newly diagnosed germ cell, liver (hepatoblastoma), brain (medulloblastoma), nerve tissue (neuroblastoma) or bone (osteosarcoma) cancers. Eligible children, one to eighteen years of age, who were to receive cisplatin according to their disease-specific regimen and, upon enrollment in this study, were randomized to receive STS or not. Efficacy of STS was determined through comparison of hearing sensitivity at follow-up relative to baseline measurements using standard audiometric techniques. The Children’s Oncology Group is responsible for funding the clinical activities for the study and we are responsible for providing the drug, drug distribution and pharmacovigilance, or safety monitoring, for the study. The trial completed enrollment of 131 pediatric patients in the first quarter of 2012. The final results of COG ACCL0431 were published in Lancet Oncology in December 2016.
 
COG ACCL0431 - Results
 COG Study ACCL0431, “A Randomized Phase III Study of Sodium Thiosulfate for the Prevention of Cisplatin-Induced Ototoxicity in Children,” finished enrollment of 131 patients of which 126 were eligible patients in Q1 2012. The patients had been previously diagnosed with childhood cancers.
 
The primary endpoint was to evaluate the efficacy of STS for prevention of hearing loss in children receiving cisplatin chemotherapy (hypothesis: 50% relative reduction in hearing loss).
 
Secondary endpoints included:
 
· | Compare change in mean hearing thresholds.
--+-------------------------------------------


· | Compare incidence of other Grade 3/4 toxicities (renal and hematological).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Monitor Event Free Survival (EFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in two groups.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
125eligible subjects were enrolled with germ cell tumor (32), osteosarcoma (29), neuroblastoma (26), medulloblastoma/pnet (26), hepatoblastoma (7) or other (5). Of these, 104 subjects (64 male and 29 <5 years old) were evaluable for the primary endpoint.

Subjects were randomized either to no treatment (control) or treatment with STS 16 grams/m2 IV over 15 minutes, 6 hours after each cisplatin dose. Hearing was measured using standard audiometry for age and data were reviewed centrally using American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria.
 
The proportion of subjects with hearing loss assessed at 4 weeks post the final cisplatin dose (primary endpoint):
 
· | The proportion of hearing loss for STS vs. Control was 28.6% (14/49) vs. 56.4% (31/55), respectively (p=0.004).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In a predefined subgroup of patients less than 5 years old with 29 eligible subjects: STS vs. Control was 21.4% (3/14) vs. 73.3% (11/15), respectively (p=0.005).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusions:
 
· | STS protects against cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children across a heterogeneous range of tumor types with even stronger efficacy in the protocol predefined subgroup of patients under five years old and is not associated with serious adverse events attributed to its use.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Further potential clinical use will be informed by the final results of SIOPEL 6 study.

Intellectual Property
 
Patents are important to developing and protecting our competitive position. Our general policy is to seek patent protection in the United States, major European countries, Japan, Canada and other jurisdictions as appropriate for our compounds and methods. U.S. patents, as well as most foreign patents, are generally effective for 20 years from the date the earliest (priority) application was filed; however, U.S. patents that issue on applications filed before June 8, 1995 may be effective until 17 years from the issue date, if that is later than the 20 year date. In some cases, the patent term may be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulatory review or because of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, delays in prosecuting the application. The duration of foreign patents varies similarly, in accordance with local law.
 
Currently, we have licensed from Oregon Health and Science University 1 U.S. and 9 foreign patents which expire in Europe. All patents expire in 2021, with an additional 2 patents pending.
 
In addition, periods of marketing exclusivity for STS may also be possible in the United States under orphan drug status and in Europe under European Market Exclusivity for Pediatric Use. We obtained U.S. Orphan Drug Designation for the use of STS in the prevention of platinum-induced ototoxicity in pediatric patients in 2004 which provides 7.5 years of market exclusivity upon approval. We plan to pursue European Market Exclusivity for Pediatric Use upon approval which would allow for 10 years of market exclusivity.
 
Our success is significantly dependent on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our product candidate, both in the United States and abroad. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, in general, is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions, which often results in apparent inconsistencies regarding the breadth of claims allowed and general uncertainty as to their legal interpretation and enforceability. Further, our principal candidate STS, is based on previously known compounds, and the candidates or products that we develop in the future may include or be based on the same or other compounds owned or produced by other parties, some or all of which may not be subject to effective patent protection. In addition, regimens that we may develop for the administration of pharmaceuticals, such as specifications for the frequency, timing and amount of dosages, may not be patentable. Accordingly, our patent applications may not result in patents being issued and issued patents may not afford effective protection. In addition, products or processes that we develop may turn out to be covered by third party patents, in which case we may require a license under such patents if we intend to continue the development of those products or processes.
 
Our patent position and proprietary rights are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Please read the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report for information about certain risks and uncertainties that may affect our patent position and proprietary rights.
 
We also rely upon unpatented confidential information to remain competitive. We protect such information principally through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, and other advisers. In the case of our employees, these agreements also provide, in compliance with relevant law, that inventions and other intellectual property conceived by such employees during their employment shall be our exclusive property.
 
Corporate Relationships

License Agreement with Oregon Health & Science University
On February 20, 2013, Fennec entered into a new exclusive license agreement with OHSU for exclusive worldwide license rights to intellectual property directed to STS and its use for chemoprotection, including the prevention of ototoxicity induced by platinum chemotherapy, in humans (the "New OHSU Agreement"). 
 
The term of the New OHSU Agreement expires on the date of the last to expire claim(s) covered in the patents licensed to us, unless earlier terminated as provided in the agreement. STS is currently protected by methods of use patents that we exclusively licensed from OHSU that expire in Europe, Canada and Australia in 2021 and are currently pending in the United States and Japan. The New OHSU Agreement is terminable by either Fennec or OHSU in the event of a material breach of the agreement by either party after 45 days prior written notice. Fennec has the right to terminate the New OHSU Agreement at any time upon 60 days prior written notice and payment of all fees due to OHSU under the New OHSU Agreement.

On May 18, 2015, Fennec negotiated an amendment ("Amendment 1") to the exclusive license agreement with OHSU. Amendment 1 expands the exclusive license agreement signed with OHSU on February 20, 2013 or New OHSU Agreement to include the use of N-acetylcysteine as a standalone therapy and/or in combination with STS for the prevention of ototoxicity induced by chemotherapeutic agents to treat cancers. Further, Amendment 1 adjusts select milestone payments entered in the OHSU Agreement including but not limited to the royalty rate on net sales for licensed products, royalty rate from sublicensing of the licensed technology and the fee payable upon the regulatory approval of a licensed product. The term of Amendment 1 under the OHSU Agreement expires on the date of the last to expire claim(s) covered in the patents licensed to Fennec or 8 years, whichever is later. In the event a licensed product obtains regulatory approval and is covered by the Orphan Drug Designation, the parties will in good faith amend the term of the agreement.
 
Competition
 
Competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries is intense. We expect that if our product candidate achieves regulatory approval for sale, it will compete on the basis of drug efficacy, safety, patient convenience, reliability, ease of manufacture, price, marketing, distribution, and patent protection, among other variables. Our competitors may develop technologies or drugs that are more effective, safer or more affordable than any we may develop.
 
There are a number of different approaches to the development of therapeutics for the treatment of cancer that are currently being used and studied. These approaches include: (i) surgery to excise the cancerous tissue; (ii) radiation therapy, which attacks cancerous cells but does not easily distinguish between healthy and diseased cells; (iii) chemotherapy, which works by preventing a cancerous cell from dividing or by killing cells that quickly divide; (iv) immunotherapy, which stimulates the body’s immune system to respond to the disease; and (v) hormone therapy, which may slow the growth of cancer cells or even kill them.
 
We are aware of a number of companies engaged in the research, development and testing of new cancer therapies or means of increasing the effectiveness of existing therapies, including, among many others, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Eisai, Merck KGaA, Novartis, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Roche, Taiho and Sanofi-Aventis. Some of these companies have products that have already received, or are in the process of receiving, regulatory approval or are in later stages of clinical development than our product. Many of them have much greater financial resources than we do. Many of these companies have marketed drugs or are developing targeted cancer therapeutics which, depending upon the mechanism of action of such agents, could be viewed as competitors.
 
We are not aware of any commercially available agents that reduce the incidence of hearing loss associated with the use of platinum-based anti-cancer agents, for which purpose we are developing STS. There are several potential competitive agents with activity in preclinical or limited clinical settings. These include: D-methionine, an amino acid that has been shown to protect against hearing loss in experimental settings but was demonstrated to be inferior to STS in comparative studies; SPI-3005, an oral agent primarily being developed by Sound Pharmaceuticals for noise and age-related hearing loss but in early Phase II trials for chemotherapy related hearing loss, which mimics glutathione peroxidase and induces the intracellular induction of glutathione; N-acetylcysteine and amifostine, which have shown effectiveness (but less than STS) in experimental systems; and Vitamin E, salicylate and tiopronin, which have all demonstrated moderate activity in rat models to protect against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, but no clinical trials have been performed. Cochlear implants, which are small electronic devices that are surgically placed in the inner ear to assist with certain types of deafness, are utilized to offer some relief but are often suboptimal.
 
Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. In addition, many of these competitors have extensive experience with preclinical testing and human clinical trials and in obtaining regulatory approvals. In addition, many of the smaller companies that compete with us have formed collaborative relationships with large, established companies to support the research, development, clinical trials and commercialization of any products that they may develop. We may rely on third parties to commercialize the products we develop, and our success will depend in large part on the efforts and competitive merit of these collaborative partners. Academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to those we seek to develop. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our projects. The existence of competitive products, including products or treatments of which we are not aware, or products or treatments that may be developed in the future, may adversely affect the marketability of any products that we may develop.

Government Regulation
 
The production and manufacture of our product candidate and our research and development activities are subject to significant regulation for safety, efficacy and quality by various governmental authorities around the world. Before new pharmaceutical products may be sold in the U.S. and other countries, clinical trials of the product must be conducted and the results submitted to appropriate regulatory agencies for approval. Clinical trial programs must establish efficacy, determine an appropriate dose and regimen, and define the conditions for safe use. This is a high-risk process that requires stepwise clinical studies in which the candidate product must successfully meet predetermined endpoints. In the U.S., the results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a product are then submitted to the FDA in the form of a Biologics License Application or a New Drug Application. In response to these submissions, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. Similar submissions are required by authorities in other jurisdictions who independently assess the product and may reach the same or different conclusions.
 
The receipt of regulatory approval often takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. On occasion, regulatory authorities may require larger or additional studies, leading to unanticipated delay or expense. Even after initial approval from the FDA or other regulatory agencies has been obtained, further clinical trials may be required to provide additional data on safety and effectiveness. Additional trials are required to gain clearance for the use of a product as a treatment for indications other than those initially approved. Furthermore, the FDA and other regulatory agencies require companies to disclose clinical trial results. Failure to disclose such results within applicable time periods could result in penalties, including civil monetary penalties.
 
In Canada, these activities are subject to regulation by Health Canada’s Therapeutic Products Directorate, or TPD, and the rules and regulations promulgated under the Food and Drug Act. In the United States, drugs and biological products are subject to regulation by the FDA. The FDA requires licensing of manufacturing and contract research facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of products and governmental review and approval of results prior to marketing therapeutic products. Additionally, the FDA requires adherence to “Good Laboratory Practices” as well as “Good Clinical Practices” during clinical testing and “Good Manufacturing Practices” and adherence to labeling and supply controls. The systems of new drug approvals in Canada and the United States are substantially similar, and are generally considered to be among the most rigorous in the world.
 
Generally, the steps required for drug approval in Canada and the United States, specifically in cancer related therapies, include:
 
· | Preclinical Studies: Preclinical studies, also known as non-clinical studies, primarily involve evaluations of pharmacology, toxic effects, pharmacokinetics and metabolism of a drug in animals to provide evidence of the relative safety and bioavailability of the drug prior to its administration to humans in clinical studies. A typical program of preclinical studies takes 18 to 24 months to complete. The results of the preclinical studies as well as information related to the chemistry and comprehensive descriptions of proposed human clinical studies are then submitted as part of the Investigational New Drug, application to the FDA, a Clinical Trial Application to the TPD, or similar submission to other foreign regulatory bodies. This is necessary in Canada, the United States and most other countries prior to undertaking clinical studies. Additional preclinical studies are conducted during clinical development to further characterize the toxic effects of a drug prior to submitting a marketing application.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase I Clinical Trials: Most Phase I clinical trials take approximately one year to complete and are usually conducted on a small number of healthy human subjects to evaluate the drug’s safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics. In some cases, such as cancer indications, Phase I clinical trials are conducted in patients rather than healthy volunteers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase II Clinical Trials: Phase II clinical trials typically take one to two years to complete and are generally carried out on a relatively small number of patients, generally between 15 and 50, in a specific setting of targeted disease or medical condition, in order to provide an estimate of the drug’s effectiveness in that specific setting. This phase also provides additional safety data and serves to identify possible common short-term side effects and risks in a somewhat larger group of patients. Phase II testing frequently relates to a specific disease, such as breast or lung cancer. Some contemporary methods of developing drugs, particularly molecularly targeted therapies, do not require broad testing in specific diseases, and instead permit testing in subsets of patients expressing the particular marker. In some cases, such as cancer indications, the company sponsoring the new drug may submit a marketing application to seek accelerated approval of the drug based on evidence of the drug’s effect on a “surrogate endpoint” from Phase II clinical trials. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory finding or physical sign that may not be a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives, but is still considered likely to predict therapeutic benefit for the patient. If accelerated approval is received, the company sponsoring the new drug must continue testing to demonstrate that the drug indeed provides therapeutic benefit to the patient.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase III Clinical Trials: Phase III clinical trials typically take two to four years to complete and involve tests on a much larger population of patients suffering from the targeted condition or disease. These studies involve conducting controlled testing and/or uncontrolled testing in an expanded patient population, numbering several hundred to several thousand patients, at separate test sites, known as multi-center trials, to establish clinical safety and effectiveness. These trials also generate information from which the overall benefit-risk relationship relating to the drug can be determined and provide a basis for drug labeling. Phase III trials are generally the most time consuming and expensive part of a clinical trial program. In some instances, governmental authorities, such as the FDA, will allow a single Phase III clinical trial to serve as a pivotal efficacy trial to support a Marketing Application.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Marketing Application: Upon completion of Phase III clinical trials, the pharmaceutical company sponsoring the new drug assembles all the chemistry, preclinical and clinical data and submits it to the TPD or the FDA as part of a New Drug Submission in Canada or a New Drug Application, in the United States. The marketing application is then reviewed by the applicable regulatory body for approval to market the product. The review process generally takes twelve to eighteen months.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any clinical trials that we conduct may not be successfully completed, either in a satisfactory time period or at all. The typical time periods described above may vary substantially and may be materially longer. In addition, the FDA and its counterparts in other countries have considerable discretion to discontinue trials if they become aware of any significant safety issues or convincing evidence that a therapy is not effective for the indication being tested. It is possible the FDA and its counterparts in other countries may not (i) allow clinical trials to proceed at any time after receiving an Investigational New Drug, (ii) allow further clinical development phases after authorizing a previous phase, or (iii) approve marketing of a drug after the completion of clinical trials.
 
While European, U.S. and Canadian regulatory systems require that medical products be safe, effective, and manufactured according to high quality standards, the drug approval process in Europe differs from that in the United States and Canada and may require us to perform additional preclinical or clinical testing regardless of whether FDA or TPD approval has been obtained. The amount of time required to obtain necessary approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA or TPD approval. European Union Regulations and Directives generally classify health care products either as medicinal products, medical devices or in vitro diagnostics. For medicinal products, marketing approval may be sought using either the centralized procedure of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, or EMEA, or the decentralized, mutual recognition process. The centralized procedure, which is mandatory for some biotechnology derived products, results in an approval recommendation from the EMEA to all member states, while the European Union mutual recognition process involves country by country approval.
 
Good Clinical Practices
 The FDA and other regulatory agencies promulgate regulations and standards, commonly referred to as current Good Clinical Practices for designing, conducting, monitoring, auditing and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. The FDA and other regulatory agencies enforce Good Clinical Practices through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If our study sites fail to comply with applicable Good Clinical Practices, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and relevant regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications.
Good Manufacturing Practices
 The FDA and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and biological products prior to approving a product. If, after receiving approval from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. All facilities and manufacturing techniques that may be used for the manufacture of our products must comply with applicable regulations governing the production of pharmaceutical products known as "Good Manufacturing Practices."
Orphan Drug Act
 Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, i.e., the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years following marketing approval, except in certain very limited circumstances, such as if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the orphan product. Legislation similar to the U.S. Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other countries, including within the European Union.
Pediatric Marketing Use Authorization 
 The PUMA approval is granted by the European Medicines Agency and is intended exclusively for pediatric (patients under 18 years of age) use. PUMA approval is valid in all countries within the European Economic Area. The PUMA process was established to make it more efficient for pharmaceutical companies to market drugs for children. New data for PUMA drugs are protected for 10 years and the applications are, in part, exempt from fees.
Other Laws
 Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights may be subject to national or supranational antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.
Research and Development
 
Our research and development efforts have been focused on the development of PEDMARKTM since 2013.

We have established relationships with contract research organizations, universities and other institutions, which we utilize to perform many of the day-to-day activities associated with our drug development. Where possible, we have sought to include leading scientific investigators and advisors to enhance our internal capabilities. Research and development issues are reviewed internally by our executive management and supporting scientific team.  
 
Research and development expenses totaled $1.9 million and $0.5 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company has increased its research and development expenses related to PEDMARKTM as a result of the Company drug manufacturing activities related to the preparation for registration batches.
 
Our product candidate still requires significant, time-consuming and costly research and development, testing and regulatory clearances. In developing our product candidate, we are subject to risks of failure that are inherent in the development of products based on innovative technologies. For example, it is possible that our product candidate will be ineffective or toxic, or will otherwise fail to receive the necessary regulatory clearances. There is a risk that our product candidate will be uneconomical to manufacture or market or will not achieve market acceptance. There is also a risk that third parties may hold proprietary rights that preclude us from marketing our product candidate or that others will market a superior or equivalent product. As a result of these factors, we are unable to accurately estimate the nature, timing and future costs necessary to complete the development of this product candidate. In addition, we are unable to reasonably estimate the period when material net cash inflows could commence from the sale, licensing or commercialization of such product candidate, if ever.
