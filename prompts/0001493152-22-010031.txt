ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
The Company was incorporated on November 3, 2008 under the laws of the State of Nevada, to engage in certain business services. Our goal, at the time, was to become a leading tournament gaming provider as well as an online destination, targeting over 250 million esports players and participants worldwide that want to compete at the high school or college level. We are a developmental stage business, have generated limited revenues to date and have a history of operating losses.
 
The Good Gaming platform was established in early 2014 by its founding members who recognized the need that millions of gamers worldwide desired to play games at competitive levels. The founders recognized that there was no structure or organization on a large scale for amateur gamers while professional esports was quickly establishing itself.
 
Good Gaming effectively built the business infrastructure for the rapidly growing esports industry, similar to the high school and college athletic industry. Good Gaming was designed to be the gateway for amateur esports athletes to compete at the semi-professional level, improve their gaming skills, and interact with veteran gamers globally in a destination site and social networking framework.
 
Good Gaming differs from the professional level of the esports industry by focusing on more than 250 million gamers that fall below the professional level but are above the casual level, classified as “amateurs.” Good Gaming distinguishes itself from its direct and indirect competitors by being the first company to offer multi-game, multi-console services at the amateur esports level. The Company was not exclusive to any particular hardware or software vendor.
 
On May 4, 2016, the Company announced that it had completed its first closed public beta testing of their 2.0 tournament platform to determine the functionality, speed, ease of use, and accuracy of the system and are preparing to enter into full-blown production.
 
On February 18, 2016, the Company, formerly HDS International Corp., acquired the assets of Good Gaming, Inc. from CMG Holdings Group, Inc. (OTCQB: CMGO). On that date, the Company’s former CEO, Paul Rauner, resigned. The Company appointed Vikram Grover to the positions of CEO and Director of the board of directors (the “Board”). Vikram Grover is a former Wall Street analyst and investment banker with more than 20 years of experience in telecommunications, media and technology. In addition, David Dorwart was elected by the majority shareholders to the Company’s Board. Mr. Dorwart is the Co-Founder and Chairman of Assist Wireless, Inc., a provider of lifeline wireless services to tens of thousands of subscribers primarily in the Midwest.
 
On June 27, 2017 the Board of Directors of the Company appointed David B. Dorwart as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. On June 21, 2017, Mr. Dorwart was appointed to serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors. David B. Dorwart, Chairman and CEO of Good Gaming, Inc., brings over 31 years of start-up entrepreneurism and executive level management to the Company. Mr. Dorwart was a Co-Founder and CEO of dPi Teleconnect, a prepaid wireless provider, for 10 years. During his tenure, Mr. Dorwart grew that company from a start-up to $75 million in revenues before selling it. Over the last 9 years, Mr. Dorwart has been involved with several other successful projects including Assist Wireless, Brooklet Energy Distribution, PayGo Distributors and Britton & Associates. Mr. Dorwart is currently the Chairman and Co-Founder of ViaOne Services, a company which specializes in wireless communications and provides intricate multi-faceted services for start-up companies utilizing industry experts. By virtue of the ownership of this Series C Preferred Stock, ViaOne is the Company’s principal stockholder.
 
On June 27, 2017, the Company also bolstered its Board of Directors with executive level professionals by adding two seasoned individuals who specialize in organization and finance as well as the branding and marketing of established and emerging organizations which are poised to show significant growth.

Technology
 
In 2016, the Company completed its 2.0 tournament platform and thereafter ran dozens of robotic internal test tournaments and held numerous free-to-play tournaments on large scales with its partner The Syndicate, the owner of the world’s longest-running online gaming guild that has 1,200 members worldwide. Good Gaming conducted two closed public beta tournaments of hundreds of participants in May 2016 in order to fully vet the system. After making roughly 100 fixes and changes to the system, it now runs smoothly. The system is designed to scale to 512,000 concurrent competitors. The Company has updated the system to handle team tournaments, which will further expand its opportunity to popular titles that have tens of millions of active players and has recently launched titles that have the potential for cross-platform play among Gaming PC, Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation.
 
In 2017, the Company ran hundreds of tournaments on a regular basis with a dedicated customer base of over 30,000 members. Additionally, the Company expanded its website by offering content relevant to the member base with information relating to game play strategy and game news. This generated nearly 100,000 unique visits per month. In an effort to monetize that traffic, the Company employed the use of Google display advertising and tested a subscription model. After careful evaluation of the Company’s strategy, management decided to move away from free tournaments and custom content and focus on growing and monetizing our Minecraft server, which has grown substantially in popularity. This decision was a result of comprehensive competitive analysis and evaluations made in how the esports industry was shifting in its space. Tournaments and custom content are currently suspended while the Company grows revenue and focuses on expanding its efforts with Minecraft. The Company has also aggressively evaluated several business models and acquisition opportunities to resume its previous success as it is related to tournaments.
 
In 2018, the Company acquired the Minecade and Olimpo Minecraft servers in order to deliver on expansion efforts. This move, coupled with continued advancement of the core Good Gaming Minecraft server substantially increased revenues and traffic. By the end of the year, the Company struck a deal with a prominent Minecraft influencer, which resulted in the single highest monthly earnings achieved within the Minecraft division, to date.
 
In 2019, following a severe downturn of business in the Minecraft sector, the Company decided to temporarily suspend the Minecade and Olimpo networks and refocus its efforts back on the core Good Gaming server. Much of the year was spent upgrading and overhauling the server’s existing infrastructure, which had grown stale over prior years. The Company adapted its strategy to target long term success and consistency through major innovations in the SkyBlock and Prison game modes, and began work towards an ambitious full recode of the Minecade server.

In 2020, the Company finalized its infrastructure overhaul for use in upcoming releases. A new, experimental version of Prison, Prison MMO, was launched as an early access game mode in February 2020. Prison MMO is designed to be a self-sustaining Minecraft game mode which incorporates elements of the Massively Multiplayer Online video game genre. The Company expects steady growth from this mode as it continues developing Prison MMO. On April 1st, 2020, the company released its first iteration of a new SkyBlock gamemode, SkyBlock Spring, to some strong success. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company implemented a new workflow management style and released its summer edition of SkyBlock. The release of the summer edition signified a renewed focus on consistent growth through regular, player focused updates. The Company’s fall release of Prison in October 2020 resulted in its single highest revenue producing month of the year, to date.
 
In 2021, the Company kicked off the first quarter with major upgrades to its Winter edition of SkyBlock along with the release of its Winter edition of Prison. The Company used this period to experiment with new release schedules and game mechanics with the goal of identifying how to further strengthen future releases. Additionally, the Company formulated a new plan to create a new game called “MicroBuddies™” that combines Ethereum ERC721 NFTs (Non-fungible tokens), non-standard ERC20 tokens (GOO™), and strategic gameplay to replicate and create unique and rare NFTs. The game will be played online via the MicroBuddies website and blockchain transactions take place on the Polygon Network.The game was launched on December 17, 2021 after more than 95% of players involved in Beta 1 and 2 testing programs voted to launch the game based on gameplay and user experience.
 
Business Strategy
 
In the past, our management team’s business strategy was to be a full-service company providing best in class Esports gaming tournaments and Minecraft experiences. With the onset of the pandemic, the Esports industry has suffered a considerable amount of lost business opportunities. We were not immune to the effects of the pandemic on our Esports business. In addition, the size of the PC-based Minecraft gaming community has shrunk considerably. We have taken a hard look at both the Esports and Minecraft business verticals and determined that both strategies are no longer in the best interest of the company and our shareholders. We feel that both the Esports and Minecraft verticals do not have significant upside in the future. As so, the Esports and Minecraft business verticals will not comprise a meaningful segment of our ongoing business strategy. We will not designate any future investment in either of these verticals for the foreseeable future.
 
With the rise in the popularity of the crypto-currency and blockchain technologies, the Company has decided to invest in the creation of its new game, “MicroBuddies™” which combines Ethereum ERC721 NFTs (Non-fungible tokens), non-standard ERC20 tokens (GOO™), and strategic, long-tail web browser gameplay to replicate and create unique and collectible NFTs. ERC20 “GOO™” tokens are limited to use as an in-game currency only. This strategy will allow us to enter the emerging NFT and blockchain gaming space. Initial revenues from “MicroBuddies™” will come from the sale of Nano Factory Tokens that will be used to synthesize generation 0 of “MicroBuddies™”. Ongoing “MicroBuddies™” revenues will be generated from a 5% royalty on all of the sales of “MicroBuddy™” NFTs in third-party marketplaces and a.0.01 MATIC per “MicroBuddy™” replication Microbuddies In 2022, we will introduce additional initiatives around the “MicroBuddies™ intellectual property. We expect the ancillary”MicroBuddies™” initiatives to create consistent, recurring revenue over the life of the project. 
 
Moving forward, we are going to expand the “MicroBuddies™” intellectual property to metaverse/virtual world social gaming experiences. There are many current and emerging metaverse/virtual world platforms. Some existing platforms already have greater than one hundred million users while other platforms are slated to launch later in 2022 or in 2023. We see building “MicroBuddies™” themed gaming experiences in these types of metaverses/virtual worlds as a solid strategy to create long tail revenue engines while exposing the “MicroBuddies™” franchise to large, diverse audiences.
