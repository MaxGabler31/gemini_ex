Item 1 - Business
Overview
Albertsons Companies, Inc. ("Albertsons" or the "Company" or "ACI") is one of the largest food and drug retailers in the United States, with both strong local presence and national scale. We also manufacture and process some of the food for sale in our stores. We maintain a website (www.AlbertsonsCompanies.com) that includes additional information about the Company. We make available through our website, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and our interactive data files, including amendments. These forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed them with, or furnished them electronically to, the SEC.
Recent Transactions
Prior to December 3, 2017, ACI had no material assets or operations. On December 3, 2017, Albertsons Companies, LLC ("ACL") and its parent, AB Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("AB Acquisition"), completed a reorganization of their legal entity structure whereby the existing equityholders of AB Acquisition each contributed their equity interests in AB Acquisition to Albertsons Investor Holdings LLC ("Albertsons Investor") and KIM ACI, LLC ("KIM ACI"). In exchange, equityholders received a proportionate share of units in Albertsons Investor and KIM ACI, respectively. Albertsons Investor and KIM ACI then contributed all of the AB Acquisition equity interests they received to ACI in exchange for common stock issued by ACI. As a result, Albertsons Investor and KIM ACI became the parents of ACI owning all of its outstanding common stock with AB Acquisition and its subsidiary, ACL, becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of ACI. On February 25, 2018, ACL merged with and into ACI, with ACI as the surviving corporation (such transactions, collectively the "Reorganization Transactions"). Prior to February 25, 2018, substantially all of the assets and operations of ACI were those of its subsidiary, ACL. The Reorganization Transactions were accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control, and accordingly, there was no change in the basis of the underlying assets and liabilities. The Consolidated Financial Statements are reflective of the changes that occurred as a result of the Reorganization Transactions. Prior to February 25,2018, the Consolidated Financial Statements of ACI reflect the net assets and operations of ACL. 
Pending Rite Aid Merger
On February 18, 2018, we entered into a definitive merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") with Rite Aid, one of the nation's leading drugstore chains. Subject to the approval of Rite Aid's stockholders and other customary closing conditions, the merger with Rite Aid is expected to close early in the second half of calendar 2018. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (i) Ranch Acquisition Corp. ("Merger Sub"), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of ACI, will merge with and into Rite Aid (the "Merger"), with Rite Aid surviving the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Ranch Acquisition II LLC ("Merger Sub II"), a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of ACI, and (ii) immediately following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will merge with and into Merger Sub II (the "Subsequent Merger" and, together with the Merger, the "Mergers"), with Merger Sub II surviving the Subsequent Merger as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of ACI. Following the Mergers, ACI common stock will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). Rite Aid common stock will be delisted from the NYSE, deregistered under the Exchange Act and will cease to be publicly traded.
At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Rite Aid common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than shares of Rite Aid common stock owned, directly or indirectly, by ACI, Merger Sub or Rite Aid (including shares of Rite Aid common stock held as treasury stock by Rite Aid), and in each case not held on behalf of third parties, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger) will be converted into the right to receive and become exchangeable for 0.1000 (the “base exchange ratio”) of a fully paid and nonassessable share of ACI common stock, without interest (the “base consideration”), plus, at the election of the holder of Rite Aid common stock, either:

• | for each share of Rite Aid common stock with respect to which an election to receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked or redeemed, and for each share of Rite Aid common stock with respect to which a Rite Aid stockholder has not made an election to receive cash or stock, an amount in cash equal to $0.1832 per share, without interest (the “additional cash consideration” and, together with the base consideration, the “cash election consideration”); provided, that to the extent the aggregate additional cash consideration to be paid to any holder of shares of Rite Aid common stock for all such holder's shares of Rite Aid common stock held in a single account would result in such stockholder being entitled to a fraction of a cent in cash with respect to the shares of Rite Aid common stock held in such account, such aggregate amount will be rounded down to the nearest whole cent; or


• | for each share of Rite Aid common stock with respect to which an election to receive additional ACI common stock has been effectively made and not revoked, 0.0079 (the “additional stock election exchange ratio” and, together with the base exchange ratio, the “stock election exchange ratio”), of a fully paid and nonassessable share of ACI common stock, without interest (the “additional stock consideration” and, together with the base consideration, the “stock election consideration”).

For the avoidance of doubt, the cash election consideration consists of both the base consideration, which consists of ACI common stock, and the additional cash consideration, which consists of cash. No fractional shares of ACI common stock will be issued in the Merger, and in lieu thereof, holders of Rite Aid common stock who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of ACI common stock will be paid upon surrender of shares of Rite Aid common stock (and after taking into account and aggregating the total number of shares of ACI common stock to be issued in exchange for the shares of Rite Aid common stock represented by all certificates, or book-entry shares, as applicable, surrendered by such holder and the shares of ACI common stock received by such holder as a result of both the base exchange ratio and the additional stock election exchange ratio) cash in an amount, without interest and rounded to the nearest cent, representing such holder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the exchange agent, on behalf of all such holders, of all fractional shares of ACI common stock which would otherwise be issued.
Debt Matters Related to the Rite Aid Merger
In connection with the proposed transaction with Rite Aid, ACI received a debt commitment letter on February 18, 2018, as amended and restated on March 12, 2018 and as further amended and restated on May 8, 2018 (as so amended and restated, the "debt commitment letter"), with Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse Loan Funding LLC, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch, Barclays Bank PLC, Royal Bank of Canada, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, PNC Bank, National Association, PNC Capital Markets LLC, Suntrust Robinson Humphrey Inc., Suntrust Bank, U.S. Bank, National Association, The Bank of Tokyo- Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Bank of Montreal, Fifth Third Bank, TD Bank, N.A. and Capital One, National Association (collectively, the "Commitment Parties"), pursuant to which, among other things, the Commitment Parties have committed to provide ACI with (i) $4,667 million of commitments to a new $5,000 million aggregate principal amount best efforts asset-based revolving credit facility (the "New ABL Facility"); (ii) incremental commitments under ACI's existing asset-based loan facility (the "ABL Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000 million in the event that the Best-Efforts ABL Facility does not become effective on the closing of the Mergers; (iii) a new asset-based term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,500 million (the "ABL Term Loan Facility"); and (iv) a new secured bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million less the gross proceeds received by ACI and its subsidiaries of new senior notes issued prior to the closing of the Mergers (the "Secured Bridge Facility") (collectively, the "Financing"), in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the debt commitment letter. The proceeds of the Financing will be used, among other things, to partially refinance certain of Rite Aid's existing indebtedness that is outstanding as of the closing date, including Rite Aid's 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021(the "2021 Rite Aid Notes") and Rite Aid's 6.125% Senior Notes due 2023 (the "2023 Rite Aid Notes" and together with the 2021 Rite Aid Notes, the "Rite Aid Notes"), and the Amended 
7

and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 27, 2001, as amended and restated as of January 13, 2015, among Rite Aid, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent and collateral agent, pay fees and expenses in connection with the Mergers and finance cash consideration, if any, in connection with the Mergers. The New ABL Facility will be utilized by ACI only if the remaining $333 million of commitments are fully allocated to new or existing lenders prior to the date on which the Mergers are consummated, in which case the incremental commitments described under clause (ii) above will cease to apply.
On March 12, 2018, ACI, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative and collateral agent, and the co-borrowers, guarantors and lenders party to the ABL Facility, entered into an amendment to the ABL Facility (the "ABL Amendment"). The ABL Amendment, among other things, permits the incurrence of the ABL Term Loan Facility and the Secured Bridge Facility and implements other modifications in connection with the Mergers.
The Merger Agreement provides that Rite Aid may redeem, repurchase or otherwise satisfy and discharge the Rite Aid Notes at any time prior to the closing date and to the extent that any Rite Aid Notes remain outstanding on the closing date, such notes will be redeemed or otherwise satisfied and discharged in full.
Additional information with respect to the expected benefits, synergies, and opportunities presented by the Merger, as well as the related risks and uncertainties, is contained in our preliminary proxy statement/prospectus, included within our registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-224169) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on April 6, 2018.
Litigation Related to the Rite Aid Merger
On April 24, 2018, Mel Aklile, a Rite Aid stockholder, (the "Plaintiff") brought a putative class action in Delaware Chancery Court against Rite Aid, the Company, Merger Sub, Merger Sub II and each of the Rite Aid directors (the "Director Defendants"), Del. C.A. No. 2018-0305-AGB. Mr. Aklile contends that Rite Aid stockholders have appraisal rights under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporate Law (the "DGCL") because, notwithstanding that (i) Rite Aid stockholders are not required to receive consideration other than shares of ACI common stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any) in the merger and shares of ACI common stock will be listed on the NYSE immediately after the merger, and (ii) the election to receive cash consideration is voluntary and dependent upon Rite Aid stockholders' election (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any), the alleged disparity in value between the additional cash consideration of $0.1832 per share and the additional stock exchange ratio of 0.0079 ACI common stock per share of Rite Aid common stock amounts to a “false choice” designed to deprive Rite Aid stockholders of their alleged appraisal rights. Plaintiff alleges breach of fiduciary duty claims against the Director Defendants for their alleged failure to provide, and inform Rite Aid stockholders of, their alleged statutory appraisal rights under Delaware law and for allegedly falsely informing Rite Aid stockholders that they will not have appraisal rights. Plaintiff further contends that the proxy statement/prospectus filed by the Company on April 6, 2018 was deficient under Section 262(d)(1) of the DGCL for failure to inform stockholders of their alleged appraisal rights. Mr. Aklile seeks declarations from the Chancery Court that the action is a proper class action and that the Director Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to adequately inform class members of their appraisal rights under Delaware law, to enjoin the proposed action from closing until such time as class members are afforded the ability to seek appraisal of their shares, or otherwise permit class members to petition the Court for appraisal, and attorneys, fees, expenses and costs to plaintiff.
Defendants oppose plaintiffs claims on the ground that Rite Aid stockholders have no right of appraisal under the DGCL because they have a right to receive all stock consideration as described in the proxy statement/prospectus filed by the Company on April 6, 2018. Defendants intend to seek to dismiss the claims against them by bringing a dispositive motion and to otherwise vigorously defend against this action.
On May 7, 2018, the Chancery Court held a hearing on Plaintiff's motion to expedite and for a preliminary injunction. The Chancery Court denied plaintiff's motion to expedite, finding that plaintiff failed to assert a colorable claim for relief.

Segments
We are engaged in the operation of food and drug retail stores that offer grocery products, general merchandise, health and beauty care products, pharmacy, fuel, and other items and services. Our retail operating divisions are geographically based, have similar economic characteristics and similar expected long-term financial performance and are reported in one reportable segment. Our operating segments and reporting units are made up of 13 divisions, which have been aggregated into one reportable segment. Each reporting unit constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which management regularly reviews the operating results. Across all operating segments, the Company operates primarily one store format. Each store offers the same general mix of products with similar pricing to similar categories of customers, have similar distribution methods, operate in similar regulatory environments and purchase merchandise from similar or the same vendors. 
Merchandising and Manufacturing
We offer more than 10,000 high-quality products under our Own Brands portfolio. Our Own Brands products resonate well with our shoppers as evidenced by Own Brands sales of over $11.5 billion in fiscal 2017. Year over year, we have demonstrated great progress and increased sales penetration of Own Brands by 60 basis points to 23%, excluding pharmacy, fuel and Starbuck's sales. 
Own Brands continues to deliver on innovation with approximately 550 new items launched in fiscal 2017 and more than 1,400 in the pipeline for fiscal 2018. We are excited about our O Organics brand, which posted a 17% growth in sales year-over-year, with over 1,200 items and plans to introduce 300 new items in fiscal 2018. O Organics now joins Lucerne, Signature and Signature Café as a billion-dollar brand. In addition to new item innovation and brand development, Own Brands continues to focus on package redesign to refresh shelf presence and comply with new regulatory nutrition guideline changes. 
As measured by units for fiscal 2017, 10.6% of our Own Brands merchandise was manufactured in company-owned facilities, and the remainder of our Own Brands merchandise was purchased from third parties. We closely monitor make-versus-buy decisions on internally sourced products to optimize their quality and profitability. In addition, we believe that the Company's scale will provide opportunities to leverage our fixed manufacturing costs in order to drive innovation across our Own Brands portfolio. As of February 24, 2018, we operated 20 food production plants. These plants consisted of seven milk plants, four soft drink bottling plants, three bakery plants, two ice cream product plants, two grocery/prepared food plants, one ice plant and one soup plant.
