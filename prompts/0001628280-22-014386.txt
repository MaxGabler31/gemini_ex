Electric Vehicle Industry Overview and Market Opportunity 
The electric vehicle industry is poised for explosive growth. Based on the Electric Vehicle Outlook 2021 report, a long-term forecast published in May 2021 by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (“BNEF Report”), passenger electric vehicle sales in the U.S., Europe, and China would grow to a total of approximately 14.0 million vehicles in 2025, from 3.1 million vehicles in 2020, and then continue to grow rapidly.
Driven by China’s new energy vehicle (“NEV”) credit and European CO2 regulations as well as city policies restricting new internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicle sales, electric vehicle sales in China and Europe are estimated to exceed 65% of all passenger electric vehicle sales by 2030, according to the BNEF Report. In addition, since many U.S. households have the infrastructure to install home charging, they are ideal adopters of electric vehicles. According to the BNEF Report, by 2040, over three-quarters of all new passenger vehicles sold will be electric, with markets in China and parts of Europe achieving even higher penetration. For commercial electric vehicles, demand for electric small vans, and trucks are expected to rise quickly, with the U. S., Europe, and China markets expanding faster than the overall market, according to the BNEF Report. In addition, the report notes that light-duty commercial vehicles will see the greatest surge in demand for electric drivetrains among all commercial vehicles. FF believes its U.S. and China dual-home market strategy, as well as its innovative DNA, strong technology portfolio, and emphasis on design, driving experience and personalized user experience will position it well in the passenger electric vehicle segments in these markets. By leveraging the scalable design and modularity of FF’s variable platform architecture, FF is well-positioned to capitalize on growing demands for light, commercial electric vehicles. Additionally, FF’s robust vehicle engineering capabilities and extensive portfolio of technologies offer significant future licensing and strategic partnership opportunities. 
Key Drivers for Electric Vehicle Market Growth 
Several important factors are contributing to the popularity of electric vehicles, in both the passenger electric vehicle and light-duty commercial vehicle segments. FF believes the following factors will continue to drive growth in these markets: 
Increasing Environmental Awareness and Tightening Emission Regulations
Environmental concerns have resulted in tightening emission regulations globally, and there is a broad consensus that further emission reductions will require increased electrification in the automotive industry. The cost of regulatory compliance for ICE power-trains is rising sharply due to the natural limitations of traditional ICE technologies. In response, global original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) are aggressively shifting their strategies toward electric vehicles. At the same time, consumers are more concerned about the impact of goods they purchase, both on their personal health and the environment. As consumer awareness increases, zero emission transportation has become a popular and widely advocated urban lifestyle which has accelerated further development in the electric vehicle market. Consumer pressure can also be seen in the commercial 
electric vehicle market. Being encouraged by their customers to reduce their carbon footprints, retailers, logistics companies, and other corporations are highly incentivized to transition their existing fleets or new vehicle purchases toward electric vehicles.
Decreasing Battery and Electric Vehicle Ownership Costs
Battery and battery-related costs generally represent the most expensive components of an electric vehicle. The falling price of lithium-ion batteries is expected to be among the most important factors affecting electric vehicle penetration in the future. Additionally, the average battery energy density is expected to increase with continuous improvements in battery chemistries, improved materials, advanced engineering, and manufacturing efficiencies. With improvements in battery technology and economies of scale, battery production costs (translated to electric vehicle ownership costs) should continue to decrease. The BNEF Report states that the average lithium-ion battery price has fallen by 89% from 2010 to 2021 to $131/kWh. They project the cost of lithium-ion batteries will fall below $100/kWh by 2024 and continue to decline as advancements in manufacturing and technology continue. According to the BNEF Report, price parity between electric vehicles and ICE is expected to be reached by the mid-2020s in most vehicle segments, subject to variation between geographies.
Strong Regulatory Push 
An increasing number of countries are encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles or a shift away from fossil-fuel-powered vehicles. For example, in the U.S., both states and municipalities have begun to roll out legislation banning combustion engines, with California mandating that every new passenger car and truck sold to be zero-emission by 2035, and every new medium and heavy-duty truck sold be zero-emission by 2045. Fifteen additional U.S. states and Washington, D.C. have announced they intend to follow California’s lead in transitioning all sales of heavy-duty trucks, vans and buses to zero-emission, with potentially more to follow in coming years. In China, the focused regulatory push has been one of the strongest drivers of NEV penetration. In recent years, the Chinese government implemented a series of favorable policies encouraging the purchase of electric vehicles and construction of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Since 2015, the Chinese regulatory authorities have provided subsidies to purchasers of electric vehicles. Although previous purchase subsidies were reduced in China by approximately half in 2019, the Chinese government has continued to provide subsidies for charging infrastructure construction. Since 2016, the Chinese central finance department has been incentivizing certain local governments with funds and subsidies for the construction and operation of charging facilities and other relevant charging infrastructure, such as charging stations and battery swap stations. Europe, UK, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Sweden have all announced plans to phase out combustion engines in some form or fashion by 2030. These legislative tailwinds have already begun to force some legacy OEMs toward electrification, creating a strong need for a modular, flexible, and cost-efficient electric vehicle solution, which will increase competition in the alternative energy vehicle industry.
Growth of Electric “Shared Mobility”
According to the BNEF Report, despite the significant near term impact from COVID-19, the global shared mobility fleet (i.e., ride-hailing and car-sharing) is expected to represent more than 15% of the total kilometers traveled by passenger vehicles by 2040, up from less than 5% in 2019. Bloomberg data also predicted that due to electric vehicles’ lower operating costs, they are anticipated to account for over 75% of shared mobility vehicles by 2040, representing a dramatic increase from current low single digit penetration. At the same time, as vehicle consumers move to rely upon shared mobility fleets, and view ride-hailing and car-sharing as a service, such trends may partially offset passenger vehicle demand growth.
Corporate History and Milestones
FF U.S., the Company’s primary U.S. operating subsidiary, was incorporated and founded in the State of California in May 2014. In July 2014, LeSee Automotive (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“LeSee Beijing”), which was previously the Company’s primary Chinese operating entity, was formed in China.
To facilitate global investment of FF’s business and operations in different jurisdictions, FF established a Cayman Islands holding company structure for the entities within the group. As part of these efforts, Smart Technology Holdings Ltd. (formerly known as FF Global Holdings Ltd.) was incorporated on May 23, 2014 in the Cayman Islands, which directly or indirectly owned and/or controlled 100% of the shareholding of all operating subsidiaries in the group. In March 2017, FF established FF Automotive (China) Co., Ltd., as a Chinese wholly-foreign-owned entity (“WFOE”). As part of a broader corporate reorganization, and to facilitate third-party investment, FF incorporated its top-level holding company, FF Intelligent Mobility Global Holdings Ltd. (formerly known as Smart King Ltd.), in the Cayman Islands in November 2017, as the parent company of Smart Technology Holdings Ltd. To enable effective control over FF’s Chinese operating entity and its subsidiaries without direct equity ownership, in November 2017, the WFOE entered into a series of contractual arrangements (“VIE contractual arrangements”) with LeSee Beijing and LeSee Zhile Technology Co., Ltd., which previously held 100% of LeSee 
Beijing. The VIE contractual arrangement enabled FF to exercise effective control over LeSee Beijing and its subsidiaries, to receive substantially all of the economic benefits of such entities, and to have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in LeSee Beijing. The VIE contractual arrangements were adjusted in the past three years and were terminated on August 5, 2020. LeSee Beijing is currently owned 99% by the WFOE.

Partnership Program 
In order to ensure the sustainability of the Company’s mission, vision and values, certain current and former executives of FF established a partnership program (the “Partnership Program”) through FF Global Partners LLC (“FF Global”) in July 2019. FF Global controls Pacific Technology Holding LLC, which indirectly holds approximately 36.2% of the voting power of FF’s share capital on a fully-diluted basis as of the date hereof. The members and managers of FF Global are treated as “partners” or “preparatory partners” from FF Global’s internal governance perspective. FF Global is managed by its board of managers (“FF Global Board”), which currently consists of eight managers — YT Jia, Matthias Aydt, Jiawei Wang, Tin Mok, Prashant Gulati, Chaoying Deng, Philip Bethell and Dr. Carsten Breitfeld. A majority of the managers of FF Global (excluding Dr. Carsten Breitfeld, who does not yet have voting rights because he has not met the tenure eligibility requirement, and once he satisfies the tenure requirement in September 2022, subject to election by the partners of FF Global, he might become a voting manager) present at a meeting of the FF Global Board where there is a quorum is required to approve any material actions of FF Global (“Reserved Matters”), including actions relating to the voting and disposition of shares of FFIE held by FF Top Holding LLC (f/k/a FF Top Holding Ltd.) (“FF Top”) and indirectly owned by FF Global. In the event of a tie at any meeting of the FF Global Board, the manager designated by Chaoying Deng as the managing partner has a casting vote. Except for the Reserved Matters, management of FF Global has been delegated to the managing partner for efficient management. Based on our investigation, we believe that YT Jia has significant influence over and may control the outcome of any actions taken by the FF Global Board through a series of familial and personal relationships that he has with the other managers on the FF Global Board. The committee has adopted policies to address the nomination and election of partners and managers of FF Global. These policies specify certain minimum requirements to be eligible for such positions, including minimum tenure as an employee of FF, business-related performance and behavior-related performance in connection with corporate cultural values during the tenure as an employee of FF, minimum tenure as a partner or preparatory partner, and payment of a portion of the capital contributions to FF Global. FF Global elects those members of FF management and FF employees who share the same mission and vision, demonstrate partnership spirit, and have made significant contributions to become partners or preparatory partners of FF Global, and issues corresponding units to them. The units may be redeemed by FF Global if the FF Global Board determines in its sole discretion that the holder has acted in a manner that is detrimental to FF Global, FF or any of their affiliates, breached the operating agreement of FF Global or any other agreement between the holder and FF Global or ceased to provide services to FF Global, FF or their affiliates with or without cause. The managers, except for the managing partner, are nominated by the partners of FF Global from the existing partners that satisfy certain qualifications and elected by all partners by plurality voting according to the policy and procedures adopted by the committee. Each partner has one vote in the process and the preparatory partners have no voting rights but each can attend the meetings of the partners. In addition, the creditors’ trust from YT Jia’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy has a substantial preferred economic interest in Pacific Technology Holding LLC and has observatory rights on the FF Global Board.
The Partnership Program is a measure to attract and retain talent of FF and FF Global. The program aims to embody the vision of a large group of management team and employees and foster the spirit of partnership. The peer nature of the partnership enables the Company’s executives and some key employees to work together without bureaucracy. FF Global has 21 partners (one of them is not a member) and 6 preparatory partners as of the date hereof. The Partnership Program is dynamic and enables admission of new partners and preparatory partners. The number of partners and preparatory partners may also change due to the removal or departure of partners and preparatory partners.
FF Technology
Variable Platform Architecture
FF believes one of its core technology competencies is its proprietary Variable Platform Architecture (“VPA”). FF’s VPA is a flexible and adaptable skateboard-like platform featuring a monocoque vehicle structure with integrated chassis and body. The platform directly houses the critical components of an electric vehicle, including all-wheel steering, suspension system, brakes, wheels, electric propulsion system, electronic control units and high voltage battery, among others. Each of these component systems has been engineered in-house or in collaboration with suppliers and has been integrated into the FF vehicles with a view to strive for optimizing performance, efficient packaging, and functional integration.
As an integrated structure, the skateboard-like platform can be shortened or lengthened to allow various wheelbases and battery pack sizes along with other options to fit into the platform. It is designed to accommodate up to three motors and support single or dual rear motors and a single front motor. The VPA can be configured in front-wheel-drive (“FWD”), rear-wheel-drive (“RWD”) or all-wheel-drive (“AWD”) configurations. The platform enables scalable vehicle design and improves manufacturing flexibility as well as capital efficiency and allows continuous improvement across product generations. It is also designed to reduce development time for future models leveraging the platform, as most of research and development and a significant portion of the crash structure is integrated into the platform and enables 5 star and equivalent safety ratings. The modular design of the VPA is adaptable to support a wide range of FF vehicles for both consumer and commercial vehicle markets. 
Propulsion Technology
FF has designed an integrated set of powertrain systems ideally suited for FF’s modular VPA. FF believes its proprietary and patented designed electric powertrain provides a leading competitive edge in horsepower, efficiency, and acceleration performance.
FF Echelon Inverter 
The inverter in FF’s electric vehicle powertrain governs the flow of high-voltage electrical current throughout the vehicle and serves to power the electric motor, generating torque while driving and delivering energy into the battery pack while braking. The inverter converts direct current from the battery pack into alternating current to drive the permanent magnet motors and provides “regenerative braking” functionality, which captures energy from braking to charge the battery pack. The primary technological advantages of FF’s designs include the ability to drive large amounts of current in a small, physical package with high efficiency and low cost (low inverter losses to provide 98% of inverter efficiency) utilizing patented parallel IGBT technology and can achieve high torque accuracy with fast transient response. The inverter can achieve high reliability due to tab bonds in the high current path. The monitoring system is integrated into the inverter to provide enhanced safety. The patented FF Echelon Inverter is designed to have high power in a compact light weight package with high reliability and durability and can support multiple motor configurations. 
Integrated Electric Motor Drive Units 
FF has internally designed its electric motor drive units (including gearbox). The electric drive units are fully integrated with the inverter, transmission, and control unit to create a compact and efficient design. The FF designed drive units have low noise and vibration that can greatly improve driving experience. Depending on the power requirements of each model, the motors can be utilized individually or in two or three motor configurations. The combination of high-power and high-torque is expected to provide users with powerful driving force. The FF 91 Futurist, equipped with three integrated electric drive units (each is designed to deliver up to 350 horsepower), is expected to deliver 1,050 horsepower and 12,510 Newton meters (“Nm”) of torque. FF believes its electric drive unit design is ahead of most of its competitors in terms of performance because of its proprietary, advanced packaging, stator-rotor design, and unique inverter layout. 
Internet, Autonomous Driving, and Intelligence (“I.A.I.”)
FF utilizes an industry-leading automotive grade dual-chip computing system running the Android Automotive operating system. FF’s I.A.I system is built on an enhanced Android Automotive code base and is upgraded with each release of Google’s platform. FF’s vehicles are designed with software OTA capabilities, which allow software and applications in the vehicle to be updated and upgraded wirelessly to deliver continuous enhancements. The vehicle will be connected to FF’s information cloud at all times. When there is a firmware or software update available, FF’s cloud will push an update message to the vehicle to notify the driver to schedule an update. Upgrades will be wirelessly downloaded to the vehicle, installed, and launched, 
including updates for firmware, operating systems, middleware, and applications. FF’s patented Future OS operating system allows multiple users to login through FF 91, preparing user’s preferences per their cloud based FFID profiles. 
For autonomous driving, FF’s Level 3 autonomous driving-ready system (“ADAS”) will deliver multiple ADAS features through a combination of FF’s own as well as industry partners’ applications. FF plans to devote resources to autonomous driving research and development and plans to work with partners to deliver full autonomous-driving capabilities in highway and urban driving, as well as parking, across its vehicle lines in the future. 
FF’s Artificial Intelligence system can actively learn preferences, habits, entertainment, and navigation routines of a user, and associates them with the user’s unique FFID (Faraday Future proprietary user ID). FFID provides a unique Faraday Future user profile that ensures a consistent experience across the FF Ecosystem, as the user goes from one seat to another or even from one vehicle to another. The seamless design and interface of the in-vehicle infotainment system planned in FF vehicles will offer multiple human-machine interface (“HMI”) options and facilitate a personalized user experience for each seat in the vehicle. The enhanced user experience platform powered by Android enables seamless access to third party applications. FF’s patented Intelligent Aggregation Engine can pull content from multiple video applications and displays content in a single area, removing the need to access multiple applications. The Intelligent Recommendation Engine that may be integrated in certain FF series learns each passenger or driver’s digital media preferences across multiple video applications and provide personalized recommendations. The User Recognition function is embedded in each seat through facial or voice recognition, to deliver a suite of personalized content and preferences. 
Electrical/ Electronic (“E/E”) Architecture 
FF plans to design the first generation of FF vehicle series (FF 91 and FF 81) to adopt a domain-centralized E/E architecture, which enables architecture flexibility and maximizes performance efficiency while meaningfully reducing the overall system complexity and weight. The domain-centralized E/E architecture will consolidate the domain functions across five core high-performance domain control units (“DCU”) that manage, compute, and process controls for propulsion, chassis, self-driving, body, and IoV (Internet over Vehicle – connected infotainment system). The E/E architecture of FF’s variable platform architecture is designed with the capacity to support the power and communication requirements necessary for seamless integration with advanced autonomous systems as they evolve. All of FF’s DCUs will support OTA updates and data collection. 
FF Products
FF has developed an extensive portfolio of proprietary technologies that will be embedded and integrated in FF vehicles. FF’s B2C passenger vehicle launch pipeline over the next five years includes FF 91 series, FF 81 series and FF 71 series. In addition to passenger vehicles, leveraging its VPA, FF plans to launch a Smart Last Mile Delivery (“SLMD”) vehicle to address the high growth last mile delivery opportunity. 
Passenger Vehicles
Each of the three passenger vehicle series is planned in two different configurations. All passenger vehicles will share common brand DNA of: 
•modern design: styling and interior materials; 
•superior driving experience: leading power, performance, and driving range; and 
•personalized user experience: space, comfort, and internet experience.
The flagship FF 91 series will define the FF brand DNA. This DNA will carry over to FF 81 and FF 71 series. At the top end, the Futurist configurations of each of these series will be designed to push the core brand values to the maximum. With this brand DNA, FF believes its products will be ahead of competition in their respective segments in terms of design, driving experience, interior comfort, connectivity, and user experience. 
FF 91
With a wheelbase of 3,200 mm (126 inches), FF 91, FF’s flagship vehicle, is designed to be a high-performance luxury electric vehicle in the E-segment/Executive/Full-Size or F-segment/Full-size luxury vehicle segment. FF has built numerous prototypes and pre-production assets for validation and testing, and recently completed its first production-intent build at its Hanford, California manufacturing plant. FF aims to launch FF 91 in the third quarter of 2022. Please refer to “Risk Factors — FF’s vehicles are in development and its first vehicle may not be available for sale in the third quarter of 2022, if at all” for a discussion on risks and uncertainties related to the expected launch.
FF believes that FF 91 represents a new “species” of electric mobility that combines high performance, precise handling, the comfort of a luxury passenger vehicle, and an intelligent, connected user interface which provides a unique mobility experience to both driver and passenger. It leverages FF’s proprietary VPA, which is a skateboard-like platform structure designed and engineered in-house. This integrated platform provides measurable improvements in overall vehicle structural performance, safety, and handling. FF 91 features a multi-motor configuration and an all-wheel drive system. With three electric motors (one in the front and two in the rear), the top configuration (FF 91 Futurist) is designed to produce 1,050 horsepower and 12,510 Nm of torque to all four wheels. This enables FF 91 Futurist to have torque vectoring in the rear for enhanced vehicle dynamics and stability. Its all-wheel drive system offers greater traction control as well as precise power distribution. This technology delivers superior acceleration and safety.
The variable platform architecture for FF 91 series houses floor-mounted batteries, as well as FF’s proprietary inverter, the FF Echelon Inverter, and integrated electric motor drive units. FF 91 is expected to charge at up to a 200kW rate. FF plans to provide charging solutions in FF’s self-owned stores and FF Partner-owned stores and showrooms. 
The FF 91 aims to deliver a first-class user experience that emphasizes personalization and comfort for all users of the vehicle, including the driver and passengers. In terms of driver comfort, there are six driver-specific screens including an ultra-large heads-up display and slim instrument cluster. The center information display supports on-screen gesturing with swipe of fingers. The reconfigurable 3D touch steering wheel can allow further user configurability. The FF 91 is a connected device that has a voice-first user interface as well as an open ecosystem for third-party applications and offers an immersive audio, video, and media experience. There are over 100 inches of high-resolution viewing area across 11 displays embedded in the vehicle. These include industry’s first 17-inch front passenger screen and industry-leading 27-inch rear passenger display, allowing passengers to stream their favorite movies, TV shows and live sports while the FF 91 is in motion without driver distraction. The voice-first foundation enables multiple natural commands at once, facilitating the areas of comfort (including air conditioning, seat positions, and doors), productivity (including text, email, and phone calls), entertainment (including media playlists and content search) and destination reaching (including refined search and navigation). The connectivity is powered by “Super Mobile AP”, which consists of up to three modems to realize aggregated high internet speed and great coverage by multi-carriers for high-throughput and continuous coverage. The Artificial Intelligence system and use of FFID (automatically loaded through facial recognition in each seat) carry the personalized user experience from seat-to-seat and vehicle-to-vehicle. The front and rear passengers will have individual sound zones, which allow passengers in the front and passengers in the rear to listen to their separate audio content with minimal sound interference. The luxury interior design of the FF 91 Futurist also features “zero gravity” seats in the rear row (with industry leading 48.9 inches rear leg room and 60-degree recline). The vehicle also offers a spa mode with personalized seat position, ventilation, massage settings, light animations, and ambient sound. 
For autonomous driving, FF 91 will have up to 12 cameras, up to 5 radar sensors, LIDAR, and 12 ultrasound sensors with full 360-degree sensor coverage to allow the FF 91 to steer autonomously once the autonomous driving software solution is validated and released. FF anticipates that its autonomous driving system will deliver several highway autonomy and parking features, and through continuous learning over time, will enable Autonomous Valet Parking (“AVP”) — where the vehicle can 
autonomously navigate a parking lot, find a parking space and park itself. Eventually, the adaptive learning could allow the driver to use an application to park and summon the vehicle after the driver has exited the vehicle.
FF 91 will feature an SAE Level 3 capable autonomous driving system that will deliver multiple ADAS features through a combination of FF’s own as well as partners’ applications. FF plans to devote resources to autonomous driving research and development and plans to work with partners to deliver full autonomous-driving capabilities in highway and urban driving, as well as parking, across its vehicle lines in the future. 
FF 91 Futurist currently has a target starting price of $180,000.
FF 81
The FF 81 series is FF’s planned second vehicle model and is aimed at the premium mass market in the D-segment or E-segment (with a wheelbase of 3,000 mm). The FF 81 will be designed and built on FF’s proprietary VPA enabling up to 60% carry-over of common parts from FF 91. In addition, parts developed for the FF 81 can be carried back to FF 91 series. The large number of common parts shared across vehicle models creates economics of scale and reduces costs. 
The FF 81 aims to deliver a premium user experience that emphasizes personalization. The FF 81 is planned with high-performance computing and next generation connectivity with a voice-first user interface and open ecosystem for third-party applications. It also has integrated, autonomous driving features and the pertinent hardware capability, including cameras, radars, ultrasound sensors, and optional LIDAR(s). 
FF 81 Futurist is expected to compete with vehicles such as the Tesla Models S/X, BMW X5 and Range Rover Sport, etc.
FF 71
FF’s third planned passenger vehicle, the FF 71 series, is expected to be a connected electric vehicle with a more compact size aiming at the mass market in the C-segment or D-segment (with a wheelbase of 2,850 mm). The FF 71 will be designed to integrate full connectivity and advanced technology into a smaller vehicle size. As FF is currently focusing on the development of the FF 91 and the FF 81, FF does not expect to start design and development of the FF 71 until 2023 and plans to launch the FF 71 Futurist configuration in the first quarter of 2025, assuming that sufficient funding is secured in a timely manner. 
FF 71 Futurist is expected to compete with vehicles such as the Porsche Macan, BMW X3, and Jaguar I-Pace.
Commercial Vehicles 
Smart Last Mile Delivery (“SLMD”)
FF plans to provide purpose-built Smart Last Mile Delivery vehicles by leveraging its proprietary technologies developed for FF’s passenger vehicles, to build tailored SLMD configurations to meet the exact customer needs, whether for fleet provider or last mile delivery divisions, while reducing development time and costs. 
FF’s technical solutions for advanced connectivity and user experience enable an easy integration of the SLMD as another device in the logistics system. Such features may include: 
•Advanced connectivity and telematics for next-gen fleet management;
•OTA upgrade capability; 
•Third party application integration on touch screen display; 
•Surround view cameras for improved visibility; 
•Equipped with Level 3 ready autonomy and ready-for-future capabilities; and
•SLMD’s adaptive modular build enables additional use cases (utilities, tradesmen, and others) with minimal additional time or investment. 
Manufacturing Strategy
FF plans to manufacture FF 91 series vehicles in its manufacturing facility in Hanford, California with a projected annual capacity of 10,000 vehicles. FF will conduct operations similar to traditional vehicle manufacturing facilities such as body assembly, paint operations, final vehicle assembly, and end-of-line testing for FF 91 in the Hanford manufacturing facility. FF intends for its vehicle engineering and manufacturing teams to work alongside one another to streamline the feedback loop for rapid product enhancements and quality improvement and will extensively utilize virtual manufacturing simulation methods to validate operations and improve the manufacturing processes. 
For additional capacity for production of the FF 91 (i.e., exceeding 10,000 vehicles annually), FF can expand production operations in Hanford or seek capacity expansion elsewhere. For the FF 81, FF plans to outsource direct vehicle production to its contract manufacturing partner in South Korea, as FF believes outsourcing could reduce capital investment and accelerate its go-to-market strategy for launching the FF 81, while providing the benefit of flexibility to scale volume to match demand level. FF may outsource the production of the FF 71 to its contract manufacture partner in South Korea or a manufacturing joint venture in China or elsewhere. These plans align with FF’s asset-light, flexible manufacturing strategy. For more information about FF’s manufacturing facility, see the discussion below under the heading “Facilities.” For more information about FF’s memorandum of understanding for contract manufacturing in South Korea, see the discussion below under the heading “Key Agreements and Partnerships.” 
Sales, Delivery, and Servicing of Vehicle 
As of the date hereof, FF has not yet sold any electric vehicles. FF plans to adopt a direct sales model that utilizes a mix of online and offline presence to drive sales. FF’s offline sales network will consist of FF’s self-owned stores and FF Partner-owned stores and showrooms. The self-owned stores are expected to establish FF brand awareness, while the FF Partner-owned stores and showrooms are expected to expand the sales and distribution network without substantial capital investment by FF. 
FF plans to establish stores and showrooms in certain key markets, which may include Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Miami, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, London, Paris, and Oslo, among other cities. These locations will operate as experiential showrooms for FF’s electric vehicle models and will provide sales, aftersales, and charging services. The FF Partner-owned stores and showrooms will support FF’s online-to-offline sales model, vehicle delivery, charging service and other user operations.
All purchase transactions will be processed online through FF’s website or mobile apps, while FF Partners will support the process (including demonstration drives and providing vehicle information) and receive compensation for sales based on 
sales territory and/or services performed. Users accessing FF.com can directly purchase the vehicle online and can choose their closest FF store or FF Partner-owned store and showroom for support. Customers going to a FF Partner-owned store will be supported by staff and directed to FF.com for purchasing. FF believes that once the reputation of FF’s vehicles has been established and users are familiar with FF vehicles, an increasing share of the vehicle sales process is likely to be completed fully online. This will further free up offline capacity and potentially increase productivity for FF’s Partner-owned stores. As FF will oversee delivery of the vehicles, both FF stores and FF Partner-owned stores and showrooms will be able to run their operations with lower on-site inventory, keeping them asset light.
The FF Partner-owned stores and showrooms will be the prioritized network for servicing FF’s vehicles, which may include repair, maintenance, and bodywork services. FF will also contract with select third-party service centers to ensure coverage and will deploy mobile service vans based on user demand. To ramp up its service capabilities, FF U.S., FF’s primary U.S. operating subsidiary, plans to enter into agreements with Somit Solutions and Cox Automotive to support the FF After-sales Systems and Operations. Somit Solutions will develop the underlying systems required to support all after-sales elements, such as warranty, parts catalog, repair manual systems. Cox Automotive will support FF after-sales operations , such as roadside assistance, towing logistics, as well as leveraging Cox’s extensive service center network. Additionally, FF users will benefit from FF’s connected remote service platform that can address a majority of service issues, perform remote diagnosis and OTA updates, perform artificial intelligence and predictive maintenance, and will be able to offer real-time service and repair status update to vehicle users. 
FF Suppliers
FF has partnered with Tier-1 reputable, international suppliers in North America, Europe, and Asia. FF has selected and on-boarded suppliers for all critical parts for the FF 91. FF aims to obtain systems, components, raw materials, parts, manufacturing equipment, and other supplies and services from suppliers which FF believes to be reputable and reliable. 
To expand the capacity for production of the FF 91 beyond FF’s Hanford plant, FF U.S. entered into a memorandum of understanding to secure additional capacity for painted bodies through its contract manufacturing partner in South Korea. FF also signed an agreement with the contract manufacturer in South Korea to reserve manufacturing capacity for the FF 81 in the same plant. FF is also exploring other potential contract manufacturing options in addition to the contract manufacturer in South Korea.

Human Capital Management
As of the date hereof, FF has 745 active employees globally. A majority of FF’s employees are engaged in research and development and related engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain functions. FF plans to ramp up additional hiring efforts for its targeted vehicle production and delivery. FF’s targeted hires typically have significant experience working for reputable OEMs, software, internet, consumer electronics and artificial intelligence companies, as well as tier-one automotive suppliers and engineering firms. FF has not experienced any work stoppages and considers its relationship with its employees to be good. None of FF’s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union.
The FF team is composed of experienced talent from a variety of industry backgrounds and nationalities with a common goal of creating highly innovative and unique products. FF’s human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating existing and additional employees. Faraday Future is committed to the principle of ESG and is committed to building a safer, cleaner world. We have a diverse workforce and are committed to maintaining the highest standards of ethics and behavior.
Governmental Regulations, Programs and Incentives 
FF operates in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become more stringent over time. The laws and regulations to which FF is subject govern, among others, vehicle emissions and the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the remediation of environmental contamination. Compliance with such laws and regulations at an international, regional, national, provincial and local level is critical to FF’s ability to continue its operations. 
Environmental standards applicable to FF are established by the laws and regulations of the countries in which FF operates, standards adopted by regulatory agencies and the permits and licenses issued to FF. Each of these sources is subject to periodic modifications and comprise what FF anticipates will be increasingly stringent requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and licenses may result in substantial administrative, civil or even criminal fines, penalties and orders to cease any violating operations or to conduct or pay for corrective work. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits or licenses. 
Vehicle Safety and Testing Regulation
FF vehicles will be subject to, and must comply with, numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including all applicable U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”). As a manufacturer, FF must self-certify that its vehicles meet all applicable FMVSSs before the vehicles are sold in the U.S. There are many FMVSSs that will apply to FF vehicles, such as crash-worthiness requirements, crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements (i.e., limitations on electrolyte spillage, battery retention and avoidance of electric shock after certain crash tests). FF’s future vehicles must fully comply with all applicable FMVSSs. Additionally, there are regulatory changes being considered for several FMVSSs, and FF must comply with all such FMVSS regulations.
In addition to FMVSS, FF will also be required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, consumer information labeling requirements, early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls and owners’ manual requirements. FF must also comply with the Automobile Information and Disclosure Act, which requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. Further, this law allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings, as determined by EPA, as well as crash test ratings as determined by NHTSA.
FF vehicles sold outside of the U.S. will be subject to similar foreign safety, environmental, and other regulations. If those regulations and standards are different from those applicable in the U.S., FF will redesign and/or retest its vehicles. For example, the European Union (“E.U.”) has established new approval and oversight rules requiring that a national authority certify compliance with heightened safety rules, emissions limits and production requirements before vehicles can be sold in each E.U. member state, the initial of which rules were rolled out on September 1, 2020, and there is also regulatory uncertainty regarding how these rules will impact sales in the United Kingdom given its recent withdrawal from the E.U. These changes could impact the rollout of new vehicle features in Europe. FF vehicles sold in China will be subject to compulsory product certification by certification authorities designated by the State Certification and Accreditation Administration Committee. Additionally, for FF vehicles to be approved for manufacture and sale in China, FF vehicles will need to be added to the Announcement of Vehicle Manufacturers and Products issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (“MIIT”) of China, by showing compliance with the relevant safety and technical requirements and other conditions, including among others, the Administrative Rules on the Admission of New Energy Vehicle Manufacturers and Products and the Administrative Rules on the Admission of Passenger Vehicles Manufacturer and Products, and passing the review by the MIIT. 
Battery Safety and Testing Regulations
FF’s battery packs must conform to mandatory regulations governing the transport of “dangerous goods” that may present a risk in transportation, which includes lithium-ion batteries, and are subject to regulations issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. (“PHMSA”). These regulations are based on the UN Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations and related UN Manual Tests and Criteria. The regulations vary by mode of transportation when these items are shipped, such as by ocean vessel, rail, truck, or air. FF will complete the applicable transportation tests for its battery packs, demonstrating its compliance with applicable regulations. FF uses lithium-ion cells in its high-voltage battery packs. The use, storage and disposal of FF’s battery packs is regulated under federal law. FF will enter into agreements with third-party battery recycling companies to recycle FF’s battery packs. 
Environmental Credits 
In connection with the production, delivery, and placement into service of FF’s zero-emission vehicles, FF may earn tradable credits under certain governmental programs designed to incentivize such activities. FF may sell FF future credits to automotive companies and other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. For example, under California’s Zero Emission Vehicle Regulation and those of states that have adopted California’s standards, vehicle manufacturers are required to earn or purchase credits, referred to as ZEV credits, for compliance with their annual regulatory requirements. These laws provide that automakers may bank or sell to other regulated parties their excess credits if they earn more credits than the minimum quantity required by those laws. FF may also earn other types of salable regulatory credits in the U.S. and abroad, including greenhouse gas, fuel economy, and clean fuels credits. 
EPA Emissions and Certification
The U.S. Clean Air Act requires that FF obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or a California Executive Order issued by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) certifying that FF vehicles comply with all applicable emissions requirements. A Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards. A CARB Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that have adopted 
California’s stricter standards for emissions controls related to new vehicles and engines sold in such states. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the CARB Executive Order for sales of vehicles. In addition to California, there are 14 other states that have either adopted or are in the process of adopting the stricter California standards, including New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Washington, Oregon, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware and Colorado. FF is required to seek an EPA Certificate of Conformity for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards or a CARB Executive Order for vehicles sold in California or any of the other 14 states identified above that have adopted the stricter California standards.
Regulation — Self Driving 
There are no federal U.S. regulations pertaining to the safety of self-driving vehicles; however, the NHTSA has established recommended guidelines. Certain U.S. states have legal restrictions on self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This patchwork of licensing requirements increases the legal complexity for FF’s vehicles. In Europe, certain vehicle safety regulations apply to self-driving braking and steering systems, and certain treaties also restrict the legality of certain higher levels of self-driving vehicles. Self-driving laws and regulations are expected to continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and foreign countries, and may create restrictions on self-driving features that FF develops.
Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation 
U.S. state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution and sale of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to consumers in the state. FF will need to secure dealer licenses (or their equivalent) and engage in sales activities for its self-owned stores and service centers, while partners in certain states will support by providing services via partner-owned stores and showrooms. FF has received its dealer license from the State of California.
In China, automobile suppliers and dealers are required to receive a business license and file and update the relevant information through the information management system for the national automobile circulation operated by the competent commerce department in China. Additionally, according to the Administrative Measures on Automobile Sales, automobile suppliers and dealers shall sell automobiles, spare parts, and other related products that are in compliance with relevant provisions and standards of the state, and the dealers shall, in an appropriate manner, expressly indicate the prices of automobiles, spare parts, and other related products as well as the rates of charges for various services on their business premises, and shall not sell products at higher prices or charge other fees without express indication. 
Competition 
FF has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, intense competition from several companies, particularly as the transportation sector increasingly shifts towards low-emission, zero-emission, or carbon neutral solutions. Many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel and electric vehicle market. Many major automobile manufacturers, such as Tesla, Porsche, Mercedes, and Audi, have electric vehicles available today. Other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles, for example Nio, xPeng, Li Auto, Canoo and Fisker, among others. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions. FF directly competes with other pure-play electric vehicle companies targeting the high-end segment, while also competing to a lesser extent with new energy vehicles (“NEVs”) and internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicles in the mid to high-end segment offered by traditional OEMs. FF believes the primary competitive factors in the electric vehicle market include, but are not limited to:
•pricing; 
•technological innovation;
•vehicle performance, quality, and safety; 
•space, comfort, and user experience; 
•service and charging options;
•design, styling, and interior materials; and 
•manufacturing efficiency. 
FF believes that it will compete favorably with its competitors on the basis of these factors. However, most of FF’s current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, supply chain, manufacturing, marketing, and other resources than FF. They may be able to deploy greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, supply chain, distribution, promotion, sales, marketing, and support of their electric vehicles. Additionally, FF’s competitors may also have greater name 
recognition, longer operating histories, lower cost of materials, larger sales forces, broader customer and industry relationships, and other resources than FF does.
