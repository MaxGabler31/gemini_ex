Item 1. Business
All references to “we,” “our,” and “us” in this Annual Report refer to Quidel Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Overview
We have a leadership position in the development, manufacturing and marketing of rapid diagnostic testing solutions. These diagnostic testing solutions are separated into our four product categories: rapid immunoassays, cardiac immunoassays, specialized diagnostic solutions and molecular diagnostic solutions. We sell our products directly to end users and distributors, in each case, for professional use in physician offices, hospitals, clinical laboratories, reference laboratories, urgent care clinics, leading universities, retail clinics, pharmacies and wellness screening centers. We market our products through a network of distributors and through a direct sales force. The Company operates in one business segment that develops, manufactures and markets our four product categories.
We commenced our operations in 1979 and launched our first products, dipstick-based pregnancy tests, in 1983. Since such time, our product base and technology platforms have expanded through internal development and acquisitions of other products, technologies and companies. Our diagnostic solutions aid in the detection and diagnosis of many critical diseases and other medical conditions, including infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases and conditions, women’s health, gastrointestinal diseases, autoimmune diseases, bone health and thyroid diseases.

The Overall Market for In Vitro Diagnostics
Customers for In Vitro Diagnostics (“IVD”) products are primarily centralized laboratories and decentralized POC or alternate settings.
Centralized testing market
The centralized in vitro diagnostic testing process typically involves obtaining a specimen of blood, urine or other sample from the patient and sending the sample from the healthcare provider’s office, hospital unit or clinic to a central laboratory. In a typical visit to the physician’s office, after the patient’s test specimen is collected, the patient is usually sent home and receives the results of the test several hours or days later. The result of this process is that the patient may leave the physician’s office without confirmation of the diagnosis and the opportunity to begin potentially more effective immediate care.
Decentralized POC market
POC testing for certain diseases has become an accepted adjunct to central laboratory and self-testing. The professional POC market is comprised of two general segments: decentralized testing in non-institutional settings, such as physicians’ offices and hospital testing (e.g., emergency rooms and bedside).

• | Out-of-hospital testing sites consist of physicians’ office laboratories, nursing homes, pharmacies, eye health offices, retail clinics and other non-institutional, ambulatory settings in which healthcare providers perform diagnostic tests.


• | Hospital POC testing is accepted and growing and is generally an extension of the hospital’s central laboratory. Hospitals in the U.S. have progressively sought to reduce the length of patient stays and, consequently, the proportion of cases seen as outpatients has increased. If the U.S. experience is representative of future trends,

5

emergency departments and other critical care units such as intensive care units, operating rooms, trauma and cardiac centers are increasingly becoming the principal centers for the management of moderate and severe acute illness.
The decentralized POC market utilizes a large variety of IVD products ranging from moderate-sized instrumented diagnostic systems serving larger group practices to single-use, disposable tests. We believe POC testing is increasing due to its clinical benefit, fast results, cost-effectiveness and patient satisfaction.
We believe that the growth in POC testing is in part due to evolving technological improvements creating high quality tests with laboratory accuracy and POC ease-of-use, some of which are capable of being granted a waiver under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”).

Women’s and General Health
Pregnancy. Our Sofia hCG fluorescent immunoassay and our QuickVue pregnancy tests are used for the qualitative detection of hCG in serum or urine for the early detection of pregnancy. The early detection of pregnancy enables the physician and patient to institute proper care, helping to promote the health of both the mother and the developing embryo.
Chlamydia. Our QuickVue Chlamydia test is a lateral flow immunoassay for the rapid, qualitative detection of Chlamydia trachomatis from endocervical swab and cytology brush specimens. The test is intended for use as an aid in the presumptive diagnosis of Chlamydia. Chlamydia trachomatis is responsible for the most widespread sexually transmitted disease in the U.S. Over one-half of infected women do not have symptoms and, if left untreated, Chlamydia trachomatis can cause sterility.
Group B Streptococcus (GBS). In 2017, we obtained FDA clearance of our Solana GBS Assay, used in conjunction with our Solana instrument, for the direct, qualitative detection of Group B Streptococcus from enriched broth cultures of specimens from antepartum women. GBS is commonly carried by pregnant women and can be transmitted to newborns at delivery, resulting in potential life-threatening illness. It is recommended that all pregnant women be tested for GBS during pregnancy.
Trichomonas. In 2016, we obtained FDA clearance of our Solana Trichomonas Assay, used in conjunction with our Solana instrument, to aid in the diagnosis of trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted disease attributable to infection from the Trichomonas vaginalis parasite. Trichomoniasis affects millions of people in the U.S., is more common in women, and can be treated with antibiotics upon diagnosis.
Bone Health. Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of the microarchitecture of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures. The risk for fracture increases exponentially with age. A key set of parameters in the monitoring of osteoporosis, both before and after therapy, are biochemical markers of bone metabolism. As a leader in the research space with our biomarkers for bone health, we produce both clinical and research products for the assessment of osteoporosis and the evaluation of bone resorption/formation, which, including our metabolic bone markers, are used by physicians to monitor the effectiveness of therapy in pharmaceutical and related research.
Eye Health
Our InflammaDry and AdenoPlus products are rapid, lateral-flow based, POC products for the detection of infectious and inflammatory diseases and conditions of the eye. InflammaDry is a test that detects elevated levels of MMP-9, a key inflammatory marker for dry eye. AdenoPlus is a test that differentiates between a viral and bacterial infection of acute conjunctivitis (pink eye).
Gastrointestinal Diseases
Clostridium difficile. In 2017, we received FDA clearance of our Solana C. difficile Assay, used in conjunction with our Solana instrument, for the direct, qualitative detection of the Clostridium difficile DNA in unformed stool specimens of patients suspected of having Clostridium difficile-infection (CDI). In addition, we sell our Lyra Direct C. difficile Assay, a qualitative, multiplexed real-time PCR test for the detection of Clostridium difficile Toxin A or Toxin B genes approved for use on a variety of real-time PCR instruments, and our AmpliVue C. difficile Assay, which uses our HDA technology, for the detection of the Clostridium difficile Toxin A gene. Clostridium difficile can be a life threatening bacterial infection, especially for the elderly and patients on a prolonged antibiotic regimen. 
Enterovirus. Enteroviruses reproduce initially in the gastrointestinal tract before spreading to other organs such as the nervous system, heart and skin. Enteroviruses can also infect the respiratory tract. Enteroviruses such as Coxsackievirus A16 are referred to as Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and commonly affect infants and children. Our indirect fluorescent antibody (“IFA”) products sold under the name Super E-Mix and D3 IFA Enterovirus kit are used by reference laboratories and acute care hospitals.
Immunoassay fecal occult blood.  Our QuickVue fecal immunochemical test is a rapid test intended to detect the presence of blood in stool specimens. Blood in the stool is an indication of a number of gastrointestinal disorders, including colorectal cancer. 
Helicobacter pylori (“H. pylori”). H. pylori is the bacterium associated with patients diagnosed with peptic ulcers. H. pylori is implicated in chronic gastritis and is recognized by the World Health Organization as a Class 1 carcinogen that may 
10

increase a person’s risk of developing stomach cancer. Our QuickVue rapid test is a serological test that measures antibodies circulating in the blood caused by the immune response to the H. pylori bacterium.
Toxicology
The toxicology testing market includes testing for substance use, misuse and abuse, including testing in connection with pain management and opioid cessation therapy. The ability to rapidly identify the impact of drug use on a patient’s clinical presentation as well as securely monitor a patient’s therapy compliance is critical to the substance abuse testing market. Our Triage TOX Drug Screen provides qualitative results for the determination of the presence of drug and/or the major metabolites in urine including assays for acetaminophen/paracetamol, amphetamines, methamphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methadone, opiates, phencyclidine, THC and tricyclic antidepressants.
Seasonality
Sales of our influenza products are subject to, and significantly affected by, the seasonal demands of the cold and flu seasons, prevalent during the fall and winter. As a result of these seasonal demands, we typically experience lower sales volume in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, and typically have higher sales in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Historically, sales of our influenza products have varied from year to year based in large part on the severity, length and timing of the onset of the cold and flu season. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, sales of our influenza products accounted for 24%, 39% and 37%, respectively, of total revenue. This percentage decreased in 2018 in part as a result of the late 2017 acquisition of the Triage and BNP Businesses.
Research and Development
We continue to focus our research and development efforts on three areas:

• | new proprietary product platform development,


• | the creation of improved products and new products for existing markets and unmet clinical needs, and


• | pursuit of collaborations with, or acquisitions of, other companies for new and existing products and markets that advance our differentiated strategy.

Research and development expenses were approximately $51.6 million, $33.6 million, and $38.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to devote a significant amount of financial resources to product and technology research and development in the foreseeable future.
Marketing and Distribution
Our business strategy is designed around serving the continuum of healthcare delivery needs globally, starting with POC clinicians located in doctor’s office practices, to moderately complex POLs, through the highly complex environment in hospital and clinical reference laboratories in North America and a variety of settings internationally.
Within the inherent operational diversity of these various segments, we focus on ensuring market leadership and providing points of differentiation by specializing in the diagnosis and monitoring of selected disease states and conditions. Our marketing strategy includes ensuring that our key product portfolios are supported by clinical validation and health economic and outcomes research that demonstrates to hospitals, laboratories, acute care facilities and POC clinicians that these tests deliver fast, high quality results, are cost-effective to use, and improve patient outcomes.
Our North America distribution strategy takes into account the fact that the POC market is highly fragmented, with many small or medium-sized customers. A network of national and regional distributors is employed, as well as our own sales force, to reach customers using POC diagnostic tests.
We have expanded the size of our North America sales force in the past few years. As of December 31, 2018, we employed more than 100 sales representatives in North America. This expanded sales force works closely with our key distributors to drive market penetration of our products in the POC market. 
The sales, distribution and service of our cell culture tests are controlled primarily by us. Laboratory end-users in hospitals and clinical reference laboratories using these diagnostic tests are reached through our own direct sales force and technical support services that have specialized training and understanding of the product portfolio.
11

Internationally, we sell products in approximately 100 countries and market and distribute products in a variety of ways, including a mix of direct and distribution strategies worldwide. Certain markets remain on transition support services provided by Abbott Laboratories in connection with the Triage and BNP Businesses.
In Europe, we currently employ more than 65 employees, to support sales and marketing activities in key countries, such as Germany and Italy and intend to add more sales personnel to support the Triage and BNP Businesses. In addition, we have created a shared service center in Galway, Ireland to support general and administrative, technical support and customer service functions in Europe. 
In Asia, we are focused on supporting the acquired Triage and BNP Businesses and continuing to grow our core immunoassay and cell culture businesses. We currently employ more than 40 employees in China, primarily to support sales and marketing efforts in China related to the acquired Triage and BNP Businesses. In addition, we are building out a shared service center in Shanghai, China to support general and administrative and technical support and customer service functions.
We derive a significant portion of our total revenue from a few distributors. Three of our distributors, which are considered to be among the market leaders, collectively accounted for approximately 44%, 54% and 44% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Note 9 “Industry and Geographic Information” and Note 12 “Acquisition” in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.
Manufacturing
We have three primary manufacturing sites. Two are in San Diego, California and one is located in Athens, Ohio. 
Our McKellar Court, Lateral Flow manufacturing facility is located in San Diego, and consists of laboratories devoted to tissue culture, cell culture, protein purification and immunochemistry. Production areas are dedicated to manufacturing and assembly. In the manufacturing process, biological and chemical supplies and equipment are used. We have invested in a high degree of automated inspection, assembly and testing. Since the year 2000, this facility has operated under a Quality Management System certified to International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) standard. The facility is certified to ISO 13485:2016 and Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”) as required for medical device manufacturers distributing product within the European Union (the “EU”) and other countries. Many of the immunoassay products manufactured in this San Diego facility are packaged and shipped by a local third party.
Our Athens facility consists of a molecular manufacturing laboratory dedicated to the manufacture and assembly of our molecular products, clean rooms (FS-209E Class 1000: ISO Class 6) for the culturing and dispensing of cell cultures under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) conditions and laboratories devoted to tissue culture for the production of monoclonal antibodies and the development and manufacture of research and MicroVue products. In the manufacturing process, biological and chemical supplies are used, as well as specialized equipment. The facility is certified to ISO 13485:2016 and MDSAP. Packaging and shipping logistics are handled at the facility.
Our Summers Ridge, San Diego facility consists of laboratories that are involved in mammalian cell culture, bacterial fermentation, protein purification and modification, as well as other techniques involved in immunoassay reagent manufacturing. These reagents are used in the manufacture of devices made at the site and are also supplied to a third party as key active ingredients for our BNP product that is run on the Beckman Coulter Immunoassay Systems. In addition, this site has production areas dedicated to creating and processing plastic components that are subsequently transformed into finished devices (Cardiac and Drugs of Abuse (“DOA”) products) using customized manufacturing equipment, including specialized automation. This facility is certified to ISO 13485:2003 / EN ISO 13485:2012 / (ISO 13485:2016 and MDSAP certification pending) medical device standards. Most of the products are packaged at this site and subsequently distributed by a third party.
We seek to conduct our manufacturing in compliance with regulations that comply to USA, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Europe, South Korea and other countries Quality Management System “QSR” requirements. Our manufacturing facilities have passed routine regulatory inspections confirming compliance with the QSR regulatory requirements. Our facilities are registered with various regulatory bodies including the USA FDA and the Department of Health Services of the State of California (the “State FDA”) for our San Diego facilities.
Government Regulation
Regulation in the United States
The testing, manufacture and commercialization of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. Pursuant to the U.S. Federal Food, 
12

Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the FDA regulates the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution and promotion of medical devices. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in, among other matters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the FDA to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices, withdrawal of marketing clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to request a recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed in the U.S. if the device is deemed to be unsafe.
In the U.S., devices are classified into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) on the basis of the controls deemed necessary by the FDA to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I and II devices are subject to general controls including, but not limited to, performance standards, premarket notification (“510(k)”) and post market surveillance. Class III devices generally pose the highest risk to the patient and are typically subject to premarket approval to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Our current products are all Class I or II.
Prior to commercialization in the U.S. market, manufacturers of diagnostic assays like our products must obtain FDA clearance through a premarket notification or premarket approval process, which can be lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The FDA has been requiring more rigorous demonstration of product performance as part of the 510(k) process, including submission of extensive clinical data. It generally takes from three to six months to obtain clearance but may take longer. A premarket approval application must be supported by valid scientific evidence to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device, typically including the results of clinical investigations, bench tests and reference laboratory studies. In addition, modifications or enhancements for existing products that could significantly affect safety, effectiveness or constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, will require new submissions to the FDA.
The FDA’s current guidance entitled “Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Recommendations for Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 CLIA Waiver Applications for Manufacturers of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices” sets forth requirements for obtaining a CLIA waiver that are onerous and have increased the time and cost required to obtain a CLIA waiver.
Any devices we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA clearance or approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies, including adherence to QSR relating to testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements. We must also comply with Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”) requirements mandating reporting to the FDA of any incident in which a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or in which a device malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Current FDA enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses.
Regulation Outside of the United States
For marketing outside the U.S., we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing and marketing approval for our products. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the U.S., and may require us to perform additional or different preclinical or clinical testing regardless of whether we have obtained FDA approval. The amount of time required to obtain necessary approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In many foreign countries, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required.
Our initial focus for obtaining marketing approval outside the U.S. is typically the European Union (the “EU”), Japan, China and Canada. EU Regulations and Directives generally classify healthcare products either as medicinal products, medical devices or in vitro diagnostics. The CE Mark certification for the EU requires us to receive ISO certification for the manufacture of our products. This certification comes only after the development of an all-inclusive quality system, which is reviewed for compliance with ISO standards by a notified body accredited by an EU member state. After certification is received, a technical file is developed which attests to the product’s compliance with Regulation (EU) 2017/746 for in vitro diagnostic medical devices. Only after this point is the product CE marked. Japanese regulations require registration of in vitro diagnostic products with the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Chinese regulations require registration of diagnostic products with China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA, formerly CFDA). Additional clinical trials are typically required for registration purposes. For products marketed in Canada, registration is required with Health Canada and we have our independent party certification under the Canadian Medical Device Regulation.
Intellectual Property
The healthcare industry has traditionally placed considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for commercially relevant technologies, devices, products and processes. We and other companies engaged in 
13

research and development of new diagnostic products actively pursue patents for technologies that are considered novel and patentable. However, important factors, many of which are not within our control, can affect whether and to what extent patent protection in the U.S. and in other important markets worldwide is obtained. By way of example, the speed, accuracy and consistency in application of the law in a patent office within any particular jurisdiction is beyond our control and can be unpredictable. The resolution of issues such as these and their effect upon our long-term success is likewise indeterminable. We have issued patents, both in the U.S. and internationally, with expiration dates ranging from the present through approximately 2036 and have patent applications pending throughout the world.
It has been our policy to file for patent protection in the U.S. and other countries with significant markets, such as Western European countries and Japan, if the economics are deemed to justify such filing and our patent counsel advises that relevant patent protection may be obtained.
A large number of individuals and commercial enterprises seek patent protection for technologies, products and processes in fields in, or related to, our areas of product development. To the extent such efforts are successful, we may be required to obtain licenses and pay significant royalties in order to exploit certain of our product strategies. Licenses may not be available to us at all or, if so available, may not be available on acceptable terms.
We are aware of certain patents issued to various developers of diagnostic products with potential applicability to our diagnostic technology. We have licensed certain rights from certain companies to assist with the manufacturing of certain products. In the future, we expect that we will require or desire additional licenses from other parties in order to refine our products further and to allow us to develop, manufacture and market commercially viable or superior products effectively.
We seek to protect our trade secrets and technology by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties (such as potential licensees, customers, strategic partners and consultants). In addition, we have implemented certain security measures in our laboratories and offices. Also, to the extent that consultants or contracting parties apply technical or scientific information independently developed by them to our projects, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such data.
Under many of our contractual agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the counterparty against costs and liabilities arising out of any patent infringement claims and other intellectual property claims asserted by a third party relating to products sold under those agreements.
Competition
Competition in the development and marketing of IVD products is intense, and innovation, product development, regulatory clearance to market and commercial introduction of new IVD technologies can occur rapidly. We believe that some of the most significant competitive factors in the rapid diagnostic market include convenience, speed to result, specimen flexibility, product menu, clinical needs, price, reimbursement levels and product performance as well as effective distribution, advertising, promotion and brand name recognition. The competitive factors in the central laboratory market are also significant and include price, product performance, reimbursement, compatibility with routine specimen procurement methods, and manufacturing products in testing formats that meet the workflow demands of larger volume laboratories. We believe our success will depend on our ability to remain abreast of technological advances, to develop, gain regulatory clearance and introduce technologically advanced products, to effectively market to customers a differentiated value proposition represented by our commercialized products, to maintain our brand strength and to attract and retain experienced personnel. The majority of diagnostic tests requested by physicians and other healthcare providers are performed by independent clinical reference laboratories. These laboratories, we expect, will continue to compete vigorously to maintain their dominance of the testing market. In order to achieve market acceptance for our products, we will be required to continue to demonstrate that our products provide physicians and central laboratories cost-effective and time-saving alternatives to other competitive products and technologies.
Many of our current and prospective commercial competitors, including several large pharmaceutical and diversified healthcare companies, have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. These competitors include, among others, Abbott Laboratories, Beckman Coulter Primary Care Diagnostics, Fisher, Becton Dickinson and Company, Meridian Bioscience, Inc., and Danaher Corporation. We also face competition from our distributors since some have created, and others may decide to create, their own products to compete with ours. Competition may also be provided from large, medium and small development companies whose portfolio and technologies are dedicated to the development of diagnostic solutions in areas in which we currently have relevant market share.
