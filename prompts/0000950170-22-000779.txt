 Item 1. Business
 General Description of the Business
 Yellow Corporation (also referred to as “Yellow,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a holding company that, through its operating subsidiaries, offers its customers a wide range of transportation services. We have one of the largest, most comprehensive less-than-truckload (“LTL”) networks in North America with local, regional, national and international capabilities. Through our team of experienced service professionals, we offer expertise in LTL shipments and flexible supply chain solutions, ensuring customers can ship industrial, commercial and retail goods with confidence.
Yellow Corporation's LTL subsidiaries include USF Holland LLC (“Holland”), New Penn Motor Express LLC (“New Penn”), USF Reddaway Inc. (“Reddaway”), YRC Inc. and YRC Freight Canada Company (both doing business as, and herein referred to as, “YRC Freight”). Our LTL companies provide services through a consolidated network of facilities located primarily across the United States and Canada. We also offer services through Yellow Logistics, Inc. (“Yellow Logistics” and f/k/a HNRY Logistics, Inc.), our customer-specific logistics solutions provider, specializing in truckload, residential, and warehouse solutions.
Incorporated in Delaware, we employed approximately 32,000 people as of December 31, 2021. The mailing address of our principal executive office is 501 Commerce Street, Suite 1120, Nashville, Tennessee 37203, and our telephone number is (913) 696-6100. Our website is www.myyellow.com. Through the “SEC Filings” link under the “Investors” tab on our website, we make our filings available as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements on Schedule 14A, filings required under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 Narrative Description of the Business
 The Company offers a full range of services for the transportation of industrial, commercial and retail goods in national, regional and international markets, primarily through the operation of owned or leased equipment in its North American ground distribution network. Transportation services are provided for various categories of goods, which may include (among others) apparel, appliances, automotive parts, chemicals, food, furniture, glass, machinery, metal, metal products, non-bulk petroleum products, rubber, textiles, wood and other manufactured products or components. The Company provides both LTL services, which combine shipments from multiple customers on a single trailer, and truckload services. Deliveries are predominately LTL shipments with truckload services offered to maximize equipment utilization and reduce empty miles (the distance empty or partially full trailers travel to balance the network). The Company also provides higher-margin specialized services, including guaranteed expedited services, time-specific deliveries, cross-border services, exhibit services, product returns, and government material shipments.
 The Company operates throughout North America with one of the largest networks of LTL service centers, equipment and transportation professionals, offering flexible and efficient supply chain solutions serving various customer needs. The Company is a transportation provider to the United States federal government. The Company also provides logistics solutions for customer-specific needs with custom projects, consolidation and distribution, reverse logistics, and residential white glove service offerings. A substantial majority of our services are provided wholly within the United States.
 Each of our LTL operating subsidiaries has employees who are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“IBT”). These employees represented approximately 80% of our workforce at December 31, 2021. Salaries, wages and employee benefits for both union and non-union employees compose over half of our operating costs.
 The Company’s employees are dedicated to operating its extensive network which transported approximately 17.2 million shipments in 2021. On December 31, 2021, the Company’s revenue fleet was comprised of approximately 14,200 tractors, including approximately 12,200 owned tractors and 2,000 leased tractors, and approximately 42,000 trailers, including approximately 32,900 owned trailers and 9,100 leased trailers. The Company’s network includes 316 strategically located service facilities including 167 owned facilities with approximately 10,200 doors and 149 leased facilities with approximately 9,100 doors, in addition to six warehouses managed by our logistics solution provider, Yellow Logistics.
 Parent Company
 Yellow Corporation's principal executive office is in Nashville, Tennessee. The Company has a field resource center in Overland Park, Kansas that provides centrally-managed support to our operating companies that spans a variety of functions, including

sales and marketing, information technology, human resources, finance and accounting, legal, transportation management, revenue management, risk management, procurement, and security.
 Competition
 Our companies operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include global, integrated freight transportation services providers, global freight forwarders, national freight services providers (including intermodal providers), regional and interregional carriers, third-party logistics providers, and small, intraregional transportation companies. The trucking industry also faces emerging competition from technology firms that specialize in load-matching services and large customers that may use their significant scale advantages to offer transportation services to their suppliers and customers.
 Our companies also have competitors within several different modes of transportation including: LTL, truckload, air and ocean cargo, intermodal rail, parcel and package companies, transportation consolidators, reverse logistics firms, and privately-owned fleets. Ground-based transportation includes private fleets and “for-hire” provider groups. The private provider segment consists of private fleets owned by companies that move their own goods and materials. The “for-hire” groups are classified based on the typical shipment sizes that they handle. Truckload refers to providers transporting shipments that generally fill an entire dry van, and LTL refers to providers transporting goods from multiple shippers in a single trailer.
 LTL transportation providers consolidate numerous shipments (generally ranging from 100 to 20,000 pounds) from varying businesses at service centers within close proximity to where those shipments originated. Utilizing expansive networks of pickup and delivery operations around local service centers, shipments are moved between origin and destination using distribution centers when necessary, where consolidation and deconsolidation of shipments occur. Depending on the distance shipped, LTL carriers are often classified into one of four sub-groups:
 •Regional - Average distance is typically fewer than 500 miles with a focus on one- and two-day delivery times. Regional transportation companies can move shipments directly to their respective destination centers, which increases service reliability and avoids costs associated with intermediate handling.
 •Interregional- Average distance is usually between 500 and 1,000 miles with a focus on two- and three-day delivery times. There is a competitive overlap between regional and national providers in this category, as each group sees the interregional segment as a growth opportunity, and few providers focus exclusively on this sector. 
 •National - Average distance is typically in excess of 1,000 miles with focus on two- to five-day delivery times. National providers rely on intermediate shipment handling through a network of facilities, which require numerous satellite service centers, multiple distribution centers and a relay network. To gain service and cost advantages, they often ship directly between service centers, minimizing intermediate handling. 
 •International - Providing freight forwarding and final-mile delivery services to companies shipping to and from multiple regions around the world. This service can be offered through a combination of owned assets or through a purchased transportation model and may involve just one leg of a shipment’s movement between countries. 
 The Company provides services in all four sub-groups in North America with a heavy concentration of services in the United States. We directly compete in the regional market and use intracompany and external interline relationships to provide service to the interregional and national transportation marketplace. Yellow Logistics is our non-asset-based provider of transportation solutions and competes with asset-based carriers, third-party logistics (“3PL”) firms, forwarders and global integrated freight transportation service providers. The Company competes against a number of providers in these markets, from small firms with one or two vehicles to global competitors with thousands of physical assets and non-asset-based logistics solutions. While we have competitors with a similar multi-dimensional approach, there are few in the traditional LTL segment with as comprehensive an offering in those categories as our brand provides.


Asset-based LTL carriers utilize 3PL firms. These asset-light service providers are both our customers and competitors. As customers, these firms aggregate truck shipment demand and distribute that demand across the transportation sector. Asset-based LTL carriers are the providers of shipping capacity to 3PL companies and thus our LTL offerings can benefit from the relationships with 3PL firms. As competitors, 3PLs often control shipper relationships and can shift shipment volumes away from specific carriers. Certain 3PLs have completed purchases of asset-based LTL carriers and certain LTL carriers have completed purchases of 3PLs, both of which have and will continue to alter the competitive landscape.
 Several technology firms have introduced load-matching technologies for heavyweight freight. Whereas these firms operate similar to a third-party logistics firm, they allow any carrier, of any size, to bid on specific shipment opportunities. They aggregate independent operators, giving shippers an easier means of engaging what has been a highly fragmented segment of trucking. Successfully winning a bid opportunity could be based on a truck’s proximity to the pick-up location, price, or other factors. Just as in the 3PL scenario, we view these as potential opportunities as well as a competitive risk.
 Large shippers with significant freight volume scale and advanced technologies offer transportation management services to their suppliers and customers. These companies often operate their own private fleets and can merge asset and non-asset based transportation solutions to create a competitive, market-facing offer.
 Competitive cost of entry into the asset-based LTL sector on a small scale, within a limited service area, is relatively low (although more so than in other sectors of the transportation industry). The larger the service area, the greater the barriers to entry, due primarily to the need for additional equipment and facilities associated with broader geographic service coverage. Broader market coverage in the competitive transportation landscape also requires increased technology investment and the ability to capture cost efficiencies from shipment density (scale), making new market entry on a national basis more difficult. Lastly, our industry has been consistently faced with challenges in competing for human capital resources, including those inherent in driver retention and hiring.
 Foreign companies have begun to invest in U.S. transportation and supply chain companies. Some of these companies are large, multi-national firms with significant resources across a broad-spectrum of the global logistics sector.
Significant technological investments to improve network efficiency and optimize asset utilization can provide carriers with cost advantages. Further development of density-based pricing strategies require carriers to continue to make investments in scanning and measuring technologies. We have already taken significant steps toward implementing these various types of technologies, and other competitors in our industry have made and continue to make investments in these technologies at varying speeds.
 Regulation
 Our operating companies and other interstate motor carriers were substantially deregulated following the enactment of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, the Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization of 1994 and the ICC Termination Act of 1995. Prices and services are now largely free of regulatory controls, although the states retained the right to require compliance with safety and insurance requirements, and interstate motor carriers remain subject to regulatory controls imposed by agencies within the U.S. Department of Transportation.
 Our companies are subject to regulatory and legislative changes, which can affect our economics and those of our competitors. Some regulatory changes could potentially impact the pool of available drivers and the costs of compensation of drivers. Various federal and state agencies regulate us, and our operations are also subject to various federal, foreign, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations dealing with transportation, storage, presence, use, disposal and handling of hazardous materials, emissions related to the use of petroleum-based fuels, fuel efficiency, discharge of storm-water and underground fuel storage tanks. Our drivers and facility employees are protected by occupational safety and health regulations and our drivers are subject to hours of service regulations. Some regulatory changes could potentially impact the pool of available drivers or otherwise increase our costs of operations. We are also subject to security regulations intended to combat terrorism imposed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other federal and state agencies. See the Risk Factors section related to our compliance with laws and regulations in Item 1A of this report.
 Environmental Matters
 Our operations are subject to U.S. federal, foreign, state, provincial and local regulations with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these regulations. Regulation in this area continues to evolve and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations, as well as the enactment and enforcement of new legislation or regulation, may require us and our customers to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation.
 Our operating companies store fuel and lubricating oils for use in our revenue equipment in approximately 200 underground storage tanks located throughout the U.S. Maintenance of such underground storage tanks is regulated at the federal and, in some

cases, state level. The underground storage tanks are required to have leak detection systems and are required to be extracted upon our exiting the property.
 During 2021, we spent approximately $7.2 million to comply with U.S. federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment (collectively, “Environmental Regulations”). In 2022, we expect to spend approximately $7.5 million to comply with the Environmental Regulations. Based upon current information, we believe that our compliance with Environmental Regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position because we have either made adequate reserves for such compliance expenditures or the cost for such compliance is expected to be small in comparison with our overall expenses.
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (known as the “Superfund Act”) imposes liability for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. Superfund Act liability is imposed without regard to fault and even if the waste disposal was in compliance with then-current laws and regulations. With the joint and several liabilities imposed under the Superfund Act, a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) may be required to pay more than its proportional share of any required environmental remediation. Several of our subsidiaries have been identified as PRPs at various sites discussed below. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and appropriate state agencies are supervising investigative and cleanup activities at these sites.
 The former Yellow Transportation (now a part of YRC Freight) has been alleged to be a PRP for two locations: Angeles Chemical Co., Santa Fe Springs, CA and Alburn Incinerator, Inc., Chicago, IL, which is included in the Lake Calumet Cluster Site. The EPA has issued YRC Freight a Request for Information (“RFI”) regarding Omega Chemical Corporation Superfund Site – Operable Unit 2, Santa Fe Springs, CA. With respect to these sites, there is little, if any evidence that YRC Freight contributed to any contamination and these allegations are not believed to present material exposure, but YRC Freight has entered into a tolling agreement with the Omega Chemical PRP Organized Group.
The former Roadway Express (now a part of YRC Freight) has been alleged to be a PRP for three locations: Ward Transformer, Raleigh, NC, Roosevelt Irrigation District, Phoenix, AZ and Berry's Creek, Carlstadt, NJ. There is little, if any, evidence connecting YRC Freight with either the Ward Transformer site or to the Roosevelt Irrigation District’s contaminated groundwater wells and any potential exposure is believed to be immaterial. The EPA and a number of PFPs have performed a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (“RI/FS”) and the EPA has issued a record of decision for an interim remedy for the Berry’s Creek Study Area (“BCSA”). The EPA has requested that YRC Freight participate in designing the remedy (the “Remedial Design”) for the BCSA. YRC Freight does not believe that it is a PRP for the BCSA and has, therefore, declined to participate in the Remedial Design.
 The EPA has issued the Company an RFI regarding current and former Yellow Transportation and Roadway Express (now YRC Freight) facilities adjacent to or in close proximity of Newtown Creek, NY and its tributaries. None of the Company’s operating companies have been named as a PRP in this matter, but YRC Freight has entered into a tolling agreement with the Newtown Creek Group (“NCG”). The NCG is comprised of five companies and the City of New York who, per Consent Order, have agreed to perform a RI/FS under the supervision of the EPA. The EPA’s website regarding this matter provides status updates of site investigations and study.
 USF RedStar LLC, a non-operating subsidiary, has been alleged to be a PRP at three locations: Booth Oil, N. Tonawanda, NY and two separate landfills in Byron, NY and Moira, NY. Holland has been alleged to be a PRP in an RFI for one location, Horton Sales Piedmont Site, Greenville County, SC.
Although the outcome of any legal matter is subject to uncertainties, based on our current knowledge, we believe the potential combined costs at all of the above sites will not be significant and that we have made adequate reserves for complying with future EPA demands at such sites.
 While PRPs in Superfund Act actions have joint and several liabilities for all costs of remediation, it is not possible at this time to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage. Based upon current information, we do not believe that probable or reasonably possible expenditures in connection with the sites described above are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations because:
 •To the extent necessary, we have established adequate reserves to cover the estimate we presently believe will be our liability with respect to the matter;
 •We and our subsidiaries have only limited or de minimis involvement in the sites based upon volumetric calculations;
 •Other PRPs involved in the sites have substantial assets and may reasonably be expected to pay a larger share of the cost of remediation; and
 •We believe that our ultimate liability is relatively small compared with our overall expenses.


We are subject to various other governmental proceedings and regulations, including foreign regulations, relating to environmental matters, and are investigating potential violations of Environmental Regulations with respect to certain sites, but we do not believe that any of these matters or investigations is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
 Economic Factors and Seasonality
 Our business is subject to a number of general economic factors that may have a material effect on the results of our operations, many of which are largely out of our control. These include supply chain interruptions and the impact of recessionary economic cycles and downturns in our customers’ business cycles, particularly in market segments and industries, such as retail and manufacturing, where we have a significant concentration of customers. Economic conditions may materially affect our customers’ business levels, the amount of transportation services they need and their ability to pay for our services. We operate in a highly price-sensitive and competitive industry, making industry pricing actions, quality of customer service, effective asset utilization and cost control major competitive factors.
 
The impact of the coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) outbreak had a considerable negative impact on our 2020 consolidated financial statements, which is reflected in our revenue metrics predominantly during the second quarter, and a lesser impact on our 2021 consolidated financial statements. See the Risk Factors section related to our forward-looking considerations in Item 1A of this report.
 All of our revenues are subject to seasonal variations which are common in the trucking industry. Customers tend to reduce shipments just prior to and after the winter holiday season. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue tend to be higher, and operating cash flows as a percent of revenue tend to be lower in the winter months, primarily due to colder weather and seasonally lower levels of shipments and the seasonal timing of expenditures. Generally, most of the first quarter and the latter part of the fourth quarter are the seasonally weakest while the second and third quarters are the seasonally strongest. The availability and cost of labor and other operating cost inputs, such as fuel, equipment maintenance and equipment replacements, can significantly impact our overall cost, competitive position within our industry and our resulting earnings and cash flows.
 Consumer and corporate purchasing behaviors may also change due to cyclical economic conditions or changes in consumer trends. For example, consumer retail shopping experienced a significant shift in market share from brick-and-mortar distribution to online purchasing and direct-to-consumer warehouse fulfillment. The Company believes that this shift was notably accelerated due to COVID-19. These changes can permanently alter distribution patterns, warehousing and inventory carrying volumes, and subsequent use of LTL.
 Human Capital Resources
 
The Company’s commitment to human capital resources is evidenced through our focus on our people. Their safety, both physical and psychological, is our top priority as we create a culture of collaboration, inclusion, integrity, leadership, and respect. We believe the Company’s success is firmly built upon our commitment to these values, giving us the ability to attract, develop, and retain quality talent. It is this ability that drives us to create an inclusive and engaged workforce where our people have a sense of belonging and can better focus on executing our strategic goals, driving innovation, and delivering on our commitment to our customers. The skills, diverse experiences, and industry knowledge of our approximately 32,000 employees significantly benefit our operations and performance.
Health and Safety
 
The Company is safety focused; hazards in the workplace are actively identified, and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken. As a team, we hold ourselves accountable to taking care of our customers and each other. We have implemented additional training and development programs for front-line employees and leaders to meet regulatory requirements and promote a culture of safety. We are honored to recognize our safest drivers with awards for reaching million-mile milestones of accident-free driving. The Company recently established a new safety committee comprised of members of the Board of Directors and management to oversee strategic initiatives regarding safety. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed new and different challenges to honor our commitment to employee health and safety. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have worked closely with local, state, and federal officials to implement protocols focused on protecting employees and minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Our cleaning, hygiene and safety protocols are designed to align around guidelines provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Occupational Health and Safety Administration, and local health authorities.
    

Labor Relations
 
As discussed throughout this filing, most of our employees are covered by our various collective bargaining agreements. As such, the Company is dedicated to managing our labor relations for those employees covered by collective bargaining agreements as well as those who are not.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging
 
The Company is committed to efforts to increase diversity within our partnerships and our workforce and has named a Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to work with a diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging ("DEIB") advisory council to guide these efforts. We believe this program has the potential to help create better partnerships, stronger customer relationships, and economic growth for our community members. The Company’s Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion as well as the DEIB advisory council, comprised of a representative group of employees within the organization, will provide strategic direction, set organizational objectives, and lead DEIB initiatives and programs. We have been honored to receive several awards highlighting our commitment to diversity and inclusion including: Top Company for Women to Work for in Transportation, Military Friendly Employer, and the National Defense Transportation Association Pathfinder Society Award.
Training and Development
 
Our Yellow Driving Academy is a paid training program whereby either current employees or newly-hired employees can get guidance and coaching through both classroom and behind-the-wheel training to enable them to get their commercial driver's license and begin a driving career with us.

We expanded the Yellow Driving Academy in early 2021 to address the nationwide shortage of experienced drivers. The comprehensive training is registered through the Department of Labor as a formal apprenticeship program and is designed to comply with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”) Entry-Level Driver Training requirements. Student training emphasizes safe driving habits through extended on road skills training.
