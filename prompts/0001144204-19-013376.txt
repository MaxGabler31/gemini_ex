Item 1.   Business 
General 
 Alcentra Capital Corporation 
 We are a specialty finance company that operates as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which we refer to as the 1940 Act. In addition, we have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code.
 We are an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or the “JOBS Act.” We expect to remain an emerging growth company until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering, or December 31, 2019. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, we will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.
 We provide customized debt and equity financing solutions primarily to middle-market companies, which we define as companies having annual earnings, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of between $15 million and $75 million although we may make investments in larger or smaller companies and other types of investments. Our investments typically range in size from $5 million to $25 million. 
 Our Adviser has a history of investing in companies that seek capital to use for leveraged buyouts, acquisitions, recapitalizations and growth initiatives. Our targeted industry sectors are: healthcare and pharmaceutical services; defense, aerospace, and government services; business and outsourced services as these sectors have generally exhibited faster growth relative to the overall economy. We may also make investments in portfolio companies that do not possess these characteristics or are outside of these industry sectors where we believe there are opportunities to prudently deploy capital. 
 Our investment activities are managed by our Adviser pursuant to the terms of an investment advisory and management agreement, which we refer to as the Investment Advisory Agreement. We expect to source investments through the extensive network of relationships that our Adviser’s principals have developed with financial sponsor firms, financial institutions, middle-market companies, management teams and other professional intermediaries. 
 Portfolio Composition 
 We originate and invest primarily in middle-market companies (typically those with $15 million up to $75 million of EBITDA) through first lien, second lien, unitranche and, to a lesser extent given the current credit environment, mezzanine debt. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had $234.8 million (at fair value) invested in 30 portfolio companies. Our portfolio included approximately 71.6% of first lien debt, 18.1% of second lien debt, 0.5% of mezzanine debt, 0.7% of CLO investments, and 9.0% of equity investments at fair value. At December 31, 2018, our average portfolio company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $8.7 million and $6.9 million, respectively, and our largest portfolio company investment by amortized cost and fair value was approximately $22.7 million and $22.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018, 86.9% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates (subject to interest rate floors), such as LIBOR, and 13.1% bore interest at fixed rates. We intend to continue to re-balance our portfolio going forward with more investments in senior secured floating rate loans.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 The weighted average yield on all of our debt investments as of December 31, 2018 was approximately 11.0%. The weighted average yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates for all of our debt investments and is computed including cash and payment in kind, or PIK interest, as well as accretion of original issue discount. As a result, the weighted average yield figure set forth above does not represent the cash interest payments we received on our debt investments during the period noted above. In this regard, the weighted average cash yield on all of our debt investments as of December 31, 2018 was approximately 11.0%. These yields do not include the dividends, including PIK dividends, received on our preferred equity investments. PIK dividends on preferred equity functions in much the same way as PIK interest on debt investments in that it is paid in the form of additional preferred securities and not cash. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield and the weighted average cash yield will remain at their current levels. 
 The companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, our investments in such companies are not rated by any rating agency. If such investments were rated, we believe that they would likely receive a below-investment grade rating from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, which is often referred to as “high-yield” and “junk.” Exposure to below-investment grade securities involves certain risks, and those securities are viewed as having predominately speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, a substantial portion of our investment portfolio consists of debt investments for which issuers are not required to make principal payments until the maturity of the loans, which may result in a substantial loss to us if such issuers are unable to refinance or repay their debt at maturity. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 3% of the income we received from our portfolio companies was in the form of non-cash income, such as PIK interest. Since PIK interest involves us recognizing income without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the annual distribution requirement applicable to RICs. Our failure to meet the annual distribution requirements could reduce the amounts available for distributions. In addition, the PIK feature of our mezzanine debt and preferred equity investments increases our credit risk exposure over the life of the investments given that it increases the amounts that our portfolio companies will ultimately be required to pay us.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Our Adviser 
 Our investment activities are managed by Alcentra NY, LLC (“Alcentra NY”), our investment adviser. Alcentra NY, together with certain of its affiliated companies (the “Alcentra Group”), is an asset management platform focused on below-investment grade credit, often referred to as “high-yield” and “junk.” Alcentra Group has offices in London, New York and Boston and representatives in Singapore and Hong Kong. Alcentra Group manages more than 75 investment vehicles and accounts totaling more than $37.0 billion in assets. 
 Our Adviser is responsible for sourcing investment opportunities, conducting industry research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring our investments and monitoring our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of investment professionals.
 The Investment Committee is currently comprised of Vijay Rajguru, Suhail A. Shaikh and Peter Glaser. See “Item 9B. Other Information” for information relating to the positions of Messrs. Rajguru, Shaikh and Glaser at the Company. Members of the Investment Committee together with other investment professionals of our Adviser, collectively have substantial experience investing and lending across changing market cycles.
 Our Adviser combines credit analysis, structuring capability and transaction experience within the larger credit investment platform of the Alcentra Group. See “Item 1. Business — General — Alcentra Group and BNY Mellon.” 
 We have entered into an Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) with our Adviser pursuant to which we pay a base management fee and incentive fees to our Adviser for its services under the agreement. See “Item 1. Business — Investment Advisory Agreement.” 
 Our Administrator 
 We have entered into a fund administration and accounting agreement, or the Administration Agreement, with State Street Bank and Trust Company, pursuant to which State Street provides us with financial reporting, post-trade compliance, and treasury services. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, we pay a fixed annual fee, paid in monthly installments in arrears, along with additional fees and expenses as incurred each month. 
 Alcentra Group and BNY Mellon 
 The Alcentra Group was formed in 2002 through the merger of two asset management divisions from Barclays Bank Plc in the United Kingdom and Imperial Credit Industries, Inc. In January 2006, Alcentra Group was purchased by BNY Mellon. As an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, which we refer to as BNY Mellon, the Alcentra Group manages approximately $37.0 billion in below-investment grade debt assets across more than 75 investment vehicles and funds. The Alcentra Group collectively employed 168 investment professionals as of December 31, 2018. Alcentra Group is the specialist below-investment grade debt manager within BNY Mellon’s group of asset management boutiques. 
 BNY Mellon is one of the largest bank holding companies in the U.S. with a market capitalization of approximately $45.2 billion and is also one of the largest securities servicing organizations with $33.1 trillion of assets under custody and administration and boasts a global platform across 35 countries as of December 31, 2018. BNY Mellon is a substantial player in asset management with approximately $1.7 trillion of assets under management as of December 31, 2018. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our investment objective is to generate both current income and to a lesser extent capital appreciation primarily by making direct investments in middle-market companies in the form of first lien, second lien and unitranche debt investments. The companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, our investments in such companies will not be rated by any rating agency. If such investments 

 3

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 were rated, we believe that they would likely receive a rating below-investment grade, which is often referred to as “high-yield” and “junk.” While our primary investment focus is to make loans to privately-held middle-market companies, we may also make investments in larger or smaller companies. 
Competitive Advantages 
  Experienced Management Team.   Members of our Adviser’s Investment Committee and other investment professionals of our Adviser collectively have substantial experience investing and lending across changing market cycles. These professionals have diverse backgrounds with prior experience in investment and management positions at investment banks, commercial banks, pension funds and asset managers. 
  Strong Transaction Sourcing Network.   Our Adviser sources investments from a network of relationships with private equity firms, middle-market senior lenders, junior-capital partners, financial intermediaries, law firms, accountants and management teams of privately owned businesses. 
  Flexible Financing Solutions.   We offer a variety of financing structures and have the flexibility to structure our investments to meet the custom needs of our portfolio companies, including among investment types and investment terms. We believe our ability to offer a variety of financing arrangements makes us an attractive partner to middle-market companies. 
  Underwriting Policies and Active Portfolio Management.   Our Adviser has implemented rigorous underwriting policies that are followed in each transaction. These policies include a detailed review and credit analysis of portfolio companies’ historical and projected financial performance as well as an assessment of the portfolio company’s business model and forecasts, which are designed to assess investment prospects via a thorough analysis of each potential portfolio company’s competitive position, financial performance, management team operating discipline, growth potential and industry attractiveness. We structure our debt investments with protective covenants, designed to proactively address changes in a portfolio company’s financial performance. After investing in a portfolio company, we monitor the investment closely, receiving financial statements on a quarterly basis as well as annual audited financial statements. We analyze and discuss in detail the portfolio company’s financial performance with management and may attend board meetings as appropriate and when available. 
  Minimize Portfolio Concentration.   We seek to diversify our portfolio across various industries and other risk areas to reduce the effects of economic downturns or regulatory changes that may affect our portfolio. We will continually seek to further diversify our portfolio through a variety of actions. 
  Access to the Alcentra Group Platform.   We seek to utilize the resources of the Alcentra Group platform across all aspects of its operations, benefiting from the Alcentra Group’s investment professionals, who in addition to their credit expertise, possess deep industry expertise. As of December 31, 2018, the Alcentra Group employed 30 analysts that closely followed 23 industries. 
Investment Guidelines for Evaluating Investment Opportunities 
 We believe that investing in debt investments provides several potential benefits, including: 
 •

 current income; 
 ​
 •

 priority in the portfolio company’s capital structure over equity holders;
 ​
 •

 significant equity sponsorship by well-regarded private equity sponsors;
 ​
 •

 creditor protections; and 
 ​
 •

 multiple exit strategies. 
 ​
 We use the following guidelines in evaluating investment opportunities. However, not all of these guidelines have been, or will be, met in connection with each of our investments. 
  Current Income.   Debt investments contractually provide either a fixed or variable coupon payable on a monthly or quarterly basis. We seek to invest in debt securities that generate interest rate coupons of between 7 – 10% and seek to minimize PIK interest. 

 4

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Priority in Capital Structure.   In liquidation, senior secured debt holders typically are repaid first, with the remaining capital distributed to unsecured creditors, including subordinated lenders, and then to the equity holders if any residual value exists. The structural priority of debt investing is a key component of our investment strategy to preserve capital.
  Covenant and Portfolio Monitoring.   We seek debt investments with financial covenants, which are used to proactively address changes in a company’s financial performance. We also will selectively invest in covenant-lite debt investments where we believe the loan-to-value and pricing are appropriate relative to the risk and will assist in portfolio diversification. 
  Multiple Exit Analysis.   When we execute each investment, an analysis of exit strategies determined by a variety of factors, including the portfolio company’s projected financial position to refinance our debt, anticipated growth dynamics and the existing mergers and acquisitions environment is conducted. Our debt is structured with a finite life, whereby the portfolio company is contractually required to repay the loan. Accelerated repayment typically occurs in the event of a refinancing, recapitalization or sale/merger of the company. 
 Private Funds.   We will invest no more than 15% of our net assets in entities which would be required to be registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act but for the exemptions in Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) thereunder (“Private Investment Companies”). Private Investment Companies include hedge funds and private equity funds. In addition, we will limit our investment in privately offered pooled investment vehicles (“Private Funds”) which include private real estate investment trusts, private oil and gas funds, private commodity pools, private real estate funds as well as Private Investment Companies, to no more than 35% of our net assets, subject to the overall limit of investing no more than 15% of our net assets in Private Investment Companies. If we change this policy and determine to invest more than 15% of our net assets in Private Investment Companies or more than 35% of our net assets in Private Funds, we have agreed with the SEC staff to only do so after we have filed, and the SEC has declared effective, a new registration statement or a post-effective amendment to our registration statement.
Transaction Sourcing and Investment Process 
  Transaction Sourcing.   We source portfolio investments from a variety of different investment sources, including private equity sponsors, fundless sponsors, family offices, management teams, financial institutions, investment bankers, accounting firms and law firms. 
  Investment Process.   Our Adviser maintains an investment process, which initiates with the sourcing of a potential transaction. Upon receiving information on a potential transaction, the information is circulated among the investment professionals of our Adviser and discussed during weekly investment meetings. Upon determination that a potential target has investment merit, our Adviser will schedule a meeting with the management team, investment bank, or private equity sponsor. 
 Typically, after completing a preliminary analysis of the target’s information, our Adviser will decide whether to “Phase I” the deal for the Investment Committee. A Phase I consists of a situation overview, a company overview, key investment considerations, investment risks, information on the management team, financial data, a financial model and investment return information. If the Phase I memorandum is approved by our Adviser’s Investment Committee, our Adviser will proceed with extensive due diligence and prepare a “Phase II” memorandum that is the basis for receiving a formal approval from our Adviser’s Investment Committee (majority approval from Investment Committee required). At least two investment professionals of our Adviser will conduct the due diligence on the target company. Updates are provided to the Investment Committee as to any material changes in the transaction, investment thesis, or any other relevant deal point, ensuring decisions are made utilizing the most current information. 
  Deal Analysis.   For each investment opportunity that includes a Phase II memorandum, our Adviser conducts in-house analytics, including an analysis of market and operational dynamics as well as historical and projected financial information. Specific attention is given to management and sponsor experience and track record, industry dynamics, revenue growth drivers and valuations and general macroeconomic conditions. Our Adviser, sometimes in conjunction with the control equity investor, often will engage a 

 5

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 consultant to interview a range of key customers, suppliers, competitors and other parties deemed relevant to the ongoing performance of the target company. The consultant will typically prepare a report that generally includes a quality of earnings report, a market study and information technology and environmental assessments. 
  Ongoing Relationship with and Monitoring of Portfolio Companies.   Our Adviser employs portfolio monitoring of portfolio companies following an investment. The monitoring process is driven by interaction and discussion with target company management, attending lender meetings and, as appropriate, board of director meetings, and may include meetings with industry experts and third party sources for market information and working with third-party consultants. Additionally, our Adviser receives and analyzes monthly and/or quarterly financial data and operating metrics which are part of the quarterly portfolio valuation and covenant compliance process. 
  Managerial Assistance.   As a BDC, we offer managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. Our Adviser or an affiliate of our Adviser will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. We may receive fees for these services and will reimburse our Adviser or an affiliate of our Adviser for its allocated costs in providing such assistance, subject to the review by our board of directors, including our independent directors. 
Determination of Net Asset Value 
 The net asset value per share of our outstanding shares of common stock is determined quarterly by dividing the value of total assets minus total liabilities by the total number of shares outstanding. 
 In calculating the value of our total assets, investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses will be computed using the specific identification method. Investments for which market quotations are readily available will be valued at such market quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market price is not readily available will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors based on the input of our management and the valuation committee of our board of directors. 
 The valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter. Our board of directors has authorized the engagement of independent valuation firms to provide us with valuation assistance on a portion of our portfolio on a quarterly basis and our entire portfolio on at least an annual basis. When an external event with respect to one of our portfolio companies, such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation. As part of our quarterly valuation process, we will record an expense accrual relating to the capital gains component of the incentive fee payable by us to Alcentra NY when the unrealized gains on our investments exceed all realized capital losses on our investments given the fact that a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to Alcentra NY if we were to liquidate our investment portfolio at such time. The actual incentive fee payable to Alcentra NY related to capital gains will be determined and payable in arrears at the end of each fiscal year and will include only realized capital gains for the period computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation for such period. 
 A readily available market value is not expected to exist for substantially all of the investments in our portfolio, and we will value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors under our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process, and in consultation with our Adviser, the valuation committee of our board of directors and, in some cases, an independent valuation firm. The types of factors that our board of directors may take into account in determining the fair value of our investments generally include, as appropriate, comparisons of financial ratios of the portfolio companies that issued such private equity securities to peer companies that are public, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and other relevant factors. 

 6

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different from the valuations currently assigned. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 •

 our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment; 
 ​
 •

 preliminary valuation conclusions will then be documented and discussed with the Adviser’s Investment Committee; 
 ​
 •

 independent valuation firms engaged by the valuation committee of the board of directors prepare preliminary valuations on a select portion of our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis (and each portfolio position on at least an annual basis) and submit the reports to the board of directors; and 
 ​
 •

 the valuation committee of the board of directors then reviews these preliminary valuations and makes a recommendation to the board of directors with respect thereto; and 
 ​
 •

 the board of directors then discusses the valuations and approves the fair value of each such investment in good faith, based on the input of the Adviser, the independent valuation firms and the valuation committee. 
 ​
 Determinations in Connection with Offerings 
 In connection with offerings of shares of our common stock, our board of directors or an authorized committee thereof will be required to make the determination that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price below the then current net asset value, or NAV, of our common stock at the time at which the sale is made. Our board of directors or an authorized committee thereof will consider the following factors, among others, in making such determination: 
 •

 the NAV of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report that we filed with the SEC; 
 ​
 •

 our management’s assessment of whether any material change in the NAV of our common stock has occurred (including through the realization of gains on the sale of our portfolio securities) during the period beginning on the date of the most recently disclosed NAV of our common stock and ending two days prior to the date of the sale of our common stock; and 
 ​
 •

 the magnitude of the difference between (i) a value that our board of directors or a committee thereof has determined reflects the current NAV of our common stock, which is generally based upon the NAV of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report that we filed with the SEC, as adjusted to reflect our management’s assessment of any material change in the NAV of our common stock since the date of the most recently disclosed NAV of our common stock, and (ii) the current offering price of our common stock. 
 ​
 These processes and procedures are part of our compliance policies and procedures. Records will be made contemporaneously with all determinations described in this section and these records will be maintained with other records that we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act. 
 Policies and Procedures for Managing Conflicts; Co-investment Opportunities 
 The 1940 Act prohibits us from making certain negotiated co-investments with affiliates unless we receive an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. On December 30, 2015, the SEC granted us relief sought in an exemptive application that expands our ability to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain other funds managed by the Adviser or certain of its affiliates, subject to compliance with certain 

 7

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 conditions. Under the terms of the order, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching with respect to us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our then-current objectives and strategies. On March 27, 2018, the SEC granted us relief sought in a new exemptive application that further expands our ability to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain other funds managed by our Adviser or certain of its affiliates, subject to compliance with certain conditions. The new exemptive relief is substantially similar to the exemptive relief from the SEC we received on December 30, 2015, except that it also permits us to co-invest in negotiated transactions with certain funds to which our Adviser serves as sub-adviser. We intend to co-invest with certain of our affiliates, subject to the conditions included in the March 2018 SEC order for exemptive relief. If we and an affiliate are unable to rely on the exemptive order to complete a transaction together, then our Adviser will determine which entity will proceed with the investment.
Fees From Services to Portfolio Companies 
 BNY Mellon Group may receive significant advisory, underwriting, or other fees from portfolio companies. Services for advisory fees may range from general corporate financial advice to restructuring advice to merger and acquisition representation. For example, BNY Mellon Group may be compensated as an advisor to a person who sold an investment to us, BNY Mellon Group may earn fees for obtaining equity or debt financing for an investor attempting to consummate an acquisition in which we are a co-investor, or BNY Mellon Group may earn fees acting as a lender, advisor or underwriter to one of our portfolio companies. None of the fees paid to BNY Mellon Group or its affiliates will be shared with us. 
Regulated Investor 
 As a result of restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and entities managed by bank holding companies (including us), our Adviser may be required or may decide to structure an investment in a manner that would be less favorable to us than structures available to a non-regulated entity. Consequently, our Adviser may choose a structure which may be less favorable to us than other structures. In addition, we may be restricted from making an investment or limited in the amount or may be required to divest an investment as a result of such restriction. See “Item 1.A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to our Business and Structure — Our activities may be limited as a result of being controlled by a bank holding company.”
 BNY Mellon has put in place policies and procedures to seek to manage and mitigate the potential conflicts of interests described above. 
 Competition 
 Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle-market companies include public and private funds, other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent that they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to maintain our qualification as a RIC. 
Employees 
 We do not have any direct employees, and our day-to-day investment operations are managed by our Adviser and each of our executive officers is an employee of the Adviser. To the extent necessary, our board of directors may hire additional personnel going forward. Our officers are employees of our Adviser and our allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs will be paid by us pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Investment Advisory Agreement 
 Alcentra NY serves as our investment adviser and is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors and in accordance with the 1940 Act, our Adviser manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory services to us. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser: 
 •

 determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; 
 ​
 •

 identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make; 
 ​
 •

 executes, closes, services and monitors the investments we make; 
 ​
 •

 determines the securities and other assets that we purchase, retain or sell; 
 ​
 •

 performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies;
 ​
 •

 provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds; 
 ​
 •

 provides, on our behalf, significant managerial assistance to any of our portfolio companies that have requested such assistance; and
 ​
 •

 provides us with office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such office facilities and such other services as the Adviser, subject to review by our board of directors, shall from time to time determine to be necessary or useful to our operations.
 ​
 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay our Adviser a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components — a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee will ultimately be borne by our stockholders. 
 Management Fee 
 The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate as follows: 1.5% of our gross assets (i.e., total assets held before deduction of any liabilities), including assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage and excluding cash and cash equivalents (such as investments in U.S. Treasury Bills), if our gross assets are less than or equal to $625,000,000; 1.4% if our gross assets are greater than or equal to $625,000,001 but less than or equal to $750,000,000; and 1.25% if our gross assets are greater than or equal to $750,000,001. These various management fee percentages (i.e. 1.5%, 1.4% and 1.25%) would apply to our entire gross assets in the event our gross assets exceed the various gross asset thresholds.
 On May 4, 2018, the Adviser agreed to a temporary 25 basis point reduction, from May 1, 2018 to April 30, 2019, across all of these base management fee breakpoints.
 Although we do not anticipate making significant investments in derivative financial instruments, the fair value of any such investments, which will equal their current market value, not their notional value, will be included in our calculation of gross assets. For services rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents (such as investments in U.S. Treasury Bills), at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately pro-rated. 
 Incentive Fee 
 We pay our Adviser an incentive fee. Incentive fees are calculated as below and payable quarterly in arrears. The incentive fee, which provides the Adviser with a share of the income that it generates for us, has two components, ordinary income and capital gains, calculated as follows: 

 9

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 The ordinary income component is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a total return requirement and deferral of non-cash amounts, and is 20.0% of the amount, if any, by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets attributable to our common stock, for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, exceeds a 2.0% hurdle rate or preferred return and a “catch-up” provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter. Under this provision, in any calendar quarter, our Adviser receives no incentive fee until our pre-incentive fee net investment income equals the hurdle rate or preferred return of 2.0%, but then receives, as a “catch-up,” 50% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate or preferred return but is less than 2.5%. Our adviser receives 20% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.5%. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income (including on our investments in U.S. Treasury Bills), dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence, managerial assistance and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, administrative expenses payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, and any interest expense and any distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee and any offering expenses and other expenses not charged to operations but excluding certain reversals to the extent such reversals have the effect of reducing previously paid incentive fees based on the deferral of non-cash interest). Pre-incentive fee net investment income excludes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income until we have received such income in cash. 
 The foregoing incentive fee is subject to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of our pre-incentive fee net investment income is payable except to the extent 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding quarters exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding quarters. In other words, any ordinary income incentive fee that is payable in a calendar quarter is limited to the lesser of (i) 20.0% of the amount by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the 2.0% hurdle, subject to the “catch-up” provision, and (ii) (x) 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters minus (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding calendar quarters. For the foregoing purpose, the “cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations” is the amount, if positive, of the sum of pre-incentive fee net investment income, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation for our then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters. In addition, the portion of such incentive fee that is attributable to deferred interest (such as PIK interest or OID) is paid to the Adviser, together with interest thereon from the date of deferral to the date of payment, only if and to the extent we actually receive such interest in cash, and any accrual thereof will be reversed if and to the extent such interest is reversed in connection with any write-off or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to any deferred interest accrual. Any reversal of such accounts would reduce net income for the quarter by the net amount of the reversal (after taking into account the reversal of incentive fees payable) and would result in a reduction and possible elimination of the incentive fees for such quarter. There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter, and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle, and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle. The Adviser has agreed to permanently waive any interest accrued on the portion of the incentive fee attributable to deferred interest (such as PIK interest or OID).
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss, subject to the total return requirement and deferral of non-cash amounts. For example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate or preferred return, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. Our

 net investment income used to calculate this component of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the base management fee. These calculations will be appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter. 
 The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee: 
 Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Net Investment Income 
 Pre-incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
(expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) 
 
Percentage of Pre-incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
Allocated to Income-Related Portion of Incentive Fee 
 The capital gains component of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and is equal to 20.0% of our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains from inception through the end of that calendar year, computed net of our aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and our aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation through the end of such year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. If such amount is negative, then no capital gains incentive fee will be payable for such year. Additionally, if the Investment Advisory Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date will be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying the capital gains incentive fee.
Payment of Our Expenses 
 All investment professionals of our Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of personnel allocable to these services to us, are provided and paid for by our Adviser and not by us.

 Administrative Services 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser furnishes us with office facilities and equipment and provides us with clerical, recordkeeping and other administrative services at such facilities. Under our Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser also provides managerial assistance on our behalf to those portfolio companies that have accepted our offer to provide such assistance. 
 Payments under the Investment Advisory Agreement for the provision of administrative services are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion (subject to the review of our board of directors) of our Adviser’s overhead in performing its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement, including rent and the fees and expenses associated with performing financial reporting and compliance functions. These reimbursable fees and expenses include the compensation of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs. 
 Duration and Termination 
 The initial investment advisory agreement between the Company and our Adviser was approved by our board of directors on March 6, 2014 and became effective on May 5, 2014. On May 4, 2018, at an in-person meeting, our board of directors, including a majority of the directors who were not “interested persons,” as defined in the 1940 Act, of the Company or our Adviser, approved the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement for a one-year term through May 5, 2019. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect from year to year thereafter if approved annually by our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and, in either case, if also approved by a majority of our directors who are not “interested persons” of the Company Under Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. The Investment Advisory Agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, by our Adviser and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days’ written notice to the other. The holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities may also terminate the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice. 
Indemnification 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members, and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering by our Adviser of its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser. 
 Organization of the Investment Adviser 
 Alcentra NY is a Delaware limited liability company. The principal executive offices of Alcentra NY are located at 200 Park Avenue, 7th Floor, New York, New York 10166.

 Board Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement 
 At an in-person meeting of the board of directors held on May 4, 2018, the board of directors approved the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement for a one-year term through May 5, 2019. 
 In approving the renewal of the investment advisory agreement, our board of directors, including a majority of our non-interested directors, made the following determinations: 
 •

  Nature, extent and quality of services.   Our board of directors received and considered information regarding the nature, extent and quality of the investment selection process employed by Alcentra NY. Our board of directors also considered the backgrounds and responsibilities of Alcentra NY’s senior personnel and their qualifications and experience in connection with the types of investments made by us, as well as Alcentra NY’s financial resources. Our board of directors determined that the nature, extent and quality of the services provided or to be provided by Alcentra NY supported the renewal of the Investment Advisory Agreement.
 ​
 •

  Investment Performance.   Our board of directors considered the investment performance of Alcentra NY, as well as comparative data with respect to the investment performance of other externally-managed business development companies. Our board of directors considered, among other things, the performance of our common stock and changes in our net asset value in comparison with other business development companies. Our board of directors concluded that Alcentra NY’s investment performance supported the renewal of the investment advisory agreement. 
 ​
 •

  Reasonableness of advisory fees.   Our board of directors considered comparative data based on publicly available information on other business development companies with respect to the advisory fees (including the management fees and incentive fees) of other business development companies. Based upon its review, our board of directors concluded that the fee schedule is comparable with the fee schedules of business development companies with similar investment objectives. 
 ​
 •

  Economies of Scale.   Our board of directors addressed the potential for Alcentra NY to realize economies of scale in managing our assets, and determined that at this time they did not expect economies of scale to be realized by Alcentra NY. 
 ​
 Based on the information reviewed and the discussions, the board of directors, including a majority of the non-interested directors, concluded that the investment management fee rates and terms are reasonable in relation to the services to be provided and approved the Investment Advisory Agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders. 
 Administration Agreement 
 Under the Administration Agreement, State Street provides us with financial reporting, post-trade compliance, and treasury services. In providing these services, State Street oversees the performance of our required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial and other records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports and other materials filed with the SEC. State Street provides post-trade compliance services including performing the applicable SEC, IRS, and BDC compliance testing, provides monthly and quarterly reporting and maintains a compliance testing matrix and performs an annual update. In addition, State Street assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of our tax returns, the printing and dissemination of reports and other materials to our stockholders and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. 
 Payments under the administration agreement equal a fixed annual fee of $130,000 and 9bps of our net managed assets plus incidental charges, paid in monthly installments in arrears, along with additional fees and expenses as incurred each month. Under the Administration Agreement, we reimburse State Street for out-of-pocket expenses incurred on our behalf for services, as well as direct pass-through vendor fees incurred on our behalf.

 License Agreement 
 We have entered into a License Agreement with our Adviser under which our Adviser has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name “Alcentra.” Under this agreement, we have a right to use the “Alcentra” name for so long as our Adviser or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the “Alcentra” name. The License Agreement will remain in effect for so long as the Investment Advisory Agreement with our Adviser is in effect. 
Exchange Act Reports 
 We maintain a website at www.alcentracapital.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K. 
 We make available on or through our website certain reports and amendments to those reports that we file with or furnish to the SEC in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. These include our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K. We make this information available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the information with, or furnish it to, the SEC. 
Regulation 
 We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between business development companies and their affiliates (including any investment advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a business development company unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 
 We may not acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these current limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company or business development company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one registered investment company or business development company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of registered investment companies or business development companies. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. 
 Qualifying Assets 
 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as “qualifying assets,” unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 
 (1)

 Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: 
 ​
 •

 is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 
 ​
 •

 is not an investment company or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 
 ​
 •

 satisfies either of the following: 
 ​
 •

 has a market capitalization of less than $250 million or does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; or 
 ​

​
  14

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 •

 is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC, the BDC actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result thereof, the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company. 
 ​
 (2)

 Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. 
 ​
 (3)

 Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. 
 ​
 (4)

 Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control. 
 ​
 (5)

 Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. 
 ​
 The regulations defining qualifying assets may change over time. We may adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area. 
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
 In addition, a business development company must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described above in Qualifying Assets categories (1), (4) or (5) above. Business development companies generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the business development company controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the business development company purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers, employees or agents, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. Our Adviser will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. 
Temporary Investments 
 Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets and/or temporary investments. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, so long as the agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification requirements in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 
Senior Securities 
 The Small Business Credit Availability Act (“SBCAA”), which was signed into law on March 23, 2018, among other things, amended Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act to add a new Section 61(a)(2) that reduces the 

 15

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 asset coverage requirement applicable to BDCs from 200% to 150% so long as the BDC meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. On May 4, 2018, our board of directors, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our board of directors, approved the applicability of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCAA. As a result, effective on May 4, 2019, our asset coverage requirement applicable to senior securities will be reduced from 200% to 150%, and the risks associated with an investment in us may increase. Thus, effective as of May 4, 2019, we will be permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance.
 In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. We consolidate our financial results with all of our wholly owned subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes and measure our compliance with the leverage test applicable to BDCs under the 1940 Act on a consolidated basis. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to our Business and Structure — Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.”
 Codes of Ethics 
 We and our Adviser have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with such code’s requirements. The code of ethics is available free of charge on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on the Company’s website at www.alcentracapital.com. 
 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of our Adviser are set out below. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by our Adviser and our directors who are not “interested persons,” and, accordingly, are subject to change. 
 As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, our Adviser has a fiduciary duty to act solely in our best interests. As part of this duty, our Adviser recognizes that it must vote our securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in our best interests. 
 Our Adviser’s policies and procedures for voting proxies for its investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 
 Proxy Policies 
 Our Adviser votes proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what it perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders. Our Adviser reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its effect on the portfolio securities we hold. In most cases our Adviser will vote in favor of proposals that our Adviser believes are likely to increase the value of the portfolio securities we hold. Although our Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative effect on our portfolio securities, our Adviser may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. 
 Our Adviser has established a proxy voting committee and adopted proxy voting guidelines and related procedures. The proxy voting committee establishes proxy voting guidelines and procedures, oversees the internal proxy voting process, and reviews proxy voting issues. To ensure that our Adviser’s vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, our Adviser requires that (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how our Adviser 

 16

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. Where conflicts of interest may be present, our Adviser will disclose such conflicts to us, including our independent directors and may request guidance from us on how to vote such proxies. 
Proxy Voting Records 
 You may obtain information about how our Adviser voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Alcentra Capital Corporation, 200 Park Avenue, 7th Floor, New York, New York 10166, or by telephone at (212) 922-8240. 
 Privacy Principles 
 We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their nonpublic personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 
 Generally, we do not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain nonpublic personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third-party administrator).
 We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to employees of our Adviser and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our stockholders. 
 Other 
 We are required to maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office. 
 We and our Adviser are each required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of relevant federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 
 We are also prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our board of directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. BDCs are generally prohibited from engaging in “joint transactions” with entities that are managed by the BDC’s investment adviser or an affiliate thereof. On December 30, 2015, the SEC granted us relief sought in an exemptive application that expands our ability to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain other funds managed by the Adviser or certain of its affiliates, subject to compliance with certain conditions. On March 27, 2018, the SEC granted us relief sought in a new exemptive application that further expands our ability to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain other funds managed by our Adviser or certain of its affiliates, subject to compliance with certain conditions. The new exemptive relief is substantially similar to the exemptive relief from the SEC we received on December 30, 2015, except that it also permits us to co-invest in negotiated transactions with certain funds to which our Adviser serves as sub-adviser. Under the terms of the order, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching with respect to us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our then-current objectives and strategies. We intend to co-invest, subject to the conditions included in the order and, upon its issuance, the new order. 

 17

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 We may also co-invest with certain other funds managed by the Adviser or certain of its affiliates in circumstances where doing so is consistent with applicable law and SEC staff interpretations. For example, we may co-invest with such entities consistent with guidance promulgated by the SEC staff permitting us and such other entities to co-invest in privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that the Adviser, acting on our behalf and on behalf of other clients, negotiates no term other than price. Any such investment would be made, subject to compliance with existing regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and our allocation procedures. In situations where we cannot rely on the exemptive order or SEC staff interpretations, our Adviser will need to decide which fund will proceed with the investment. 
 Compliance with the JOBS Act 
 We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act and we have taken and will continue to be able to take advantage of certain specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We expect to remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of:
 •

 the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering, or December 31, 2019;
 ​
 •

 the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion;
 ​
 •

 the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and
 ​
 •

 the date on which we qualify as a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals $700 million or more as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.
 ​
 The JOBS Act affords an emerging growth company the opportunity to get an exemption from certain SEC regulations for up to five years. This includes an exemption from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements. The JOBS Act provides scaled disclosure provisions for emerging growth companies, including, among other things, removing the requirement that emerging growth companies comply with Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b) auditor attestation of internal control over financial reporting. This exemption may increase the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. 
 Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act also permits an emerging growth company to elect an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until such time as these new or revised standards are made applicable to all private companies. We have determined not to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. 
 Compliance with NASDAQ Global Select Market Listing Requirements 
 Our shares of common stock are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “ABDC.” As a listed company on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, we are subject to various listing standards, including corporate governance listing standards. We monitor our compliance with all listing standards and take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 
 Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 
 •

 pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 
 ​

​
  18

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 •

 pursuant to Item 307 under Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; 
 ​
 •

 pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and, starting from the date on which we cease to be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, must obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting performed by our independent registered public accounting firm; and
 ​
 •

 pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. 
 ​
 Compliance with the Bank Holding Company Act 
 BNY Mellon is a bank holding company, or a “BHC” under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or the “BHCA.” BNY Mellon is also a financial holding company, or “FHC,” under the BHCA, which is a status available to BHCs that meet certain criteria. As a BHC and a FHC, the activities of BNY Mellon and its affiliates are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the BHCA and related regulations. BHCs and FHCs are subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve. Because BNY Mellon may be deemed to “control” us within the meaning of the BHCA, restrictions under the BHCA could apply to us. Accordingly, the BHCA and other applicable banking laws, rules, regulations and guidelines, and their interpretation and administration by the appropriate regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the Federal Reserve, may restrict the transactions and relationships between our Adviser, BNY Mellon and their affiliates, on the one hand, and us on the other hand, and may restrict our investments, transactions and operations. For example, the BHCA regulations applicable to BNY Mellon and us may, among other things, restrict our ability to make certain investments or the size of certain investments, impose a maximum holding period on some or all of our investments, and restrict our Adviser’s ability to participate in the management and operations of the companies in which we invest. In addition, certain BHCA regulations may require aggregation of the positions owned, held or controlled by related entities. Thus, in certain circumstances, positions held by BNY Mellon and its affiliates (including our Adviser) for client and proprietary accounts may need to be aggregated with positions held by us. In this case, where BHCA regulations impose a cap on the amount of a position that may be held, BNY Mellon may utilize available capacity to make investments for its proprietary accounts or for the accounts of other clients, which may require us to limit and/or liquidate certain investments. Additionally, BNY Mellon may in the future, in its sole discretion and without notice to investors, engage in activities impacting us and/or our Adviser in order to comply with the BHCA or other legal requirements applicable to, or reduce or eliminate the impact or applicability of any bank regulatory or other restrictions on BNY Mellon, us or other funds and accounts managed by our Adviser and its affiliates. 
Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code effective as of our taxable year ended December 31, 2014, and intend to qualify annually thereafter. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which generally is our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”). 
 Taxation as a RIC 
 For any taxable year in which we: 
 •

 qualify as a RIC; and 
 ​

​

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 •

 satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, 
 ​
 we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 
 We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no corporate-level U.S. federal income tax (the “Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement”).
 In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 
 •

 continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; 
 ​
 •

 derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities (the “90% Income Test”); and 
 ​
 •

 diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
 ​
 •

 at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and 
 ​
 •

 no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (the “Diversification Tests”). 
 ​
 In accordance with certain applicable Treasury regulations and guidance published by the IRS, a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many stockholders elect to receive cash, the cash available for distribution must be allocated among the shareholders electing to receive cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any stockholder, electing to receive cash, receive less the lesser of (a) the portion of the distribution such shareholder has elected to receive in cash or (b) an amount equal to his or her entire distribution times the percentage limitation on cash available for distribution. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these Treasury regulations and published guidance. 
 We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest, deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock, or certain income with respect to equity investments in foreign corporations. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. 
 Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we generally are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If we are prohibited from making distributions or are unable to obtain cash from other sources to make the distributions, we may fail to qualify as a RIC, which would result in us becoming subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. 
 Any transactions in options, futures contracts, constructive sales, hedging, straddle, conversion or similar transactions, and forward contracts will be subject to special tax rules, the effect of which may be to accelerate income to us, defer losses, cause adjustments to the holding periods of our investments, convert long-term capital gains into short-term capital gains, convert short-term capital losses into long-term capital losses or have other tax consequences. These rules could affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to stockholders. We do not currently intend to engage in these types of transactions. 
 A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its investment company taxable income (which is, generally, ordinary income plus net realized short-term capital gains in excess of net realized long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed gross taxable income, we would experience a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, we may for tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such required distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, you may receive a larger capital gain distribution than you would have received in the absence of such transactions. 
 Investment income received from sources within foreign countries, or capital gains earned by investing in securities of foreign issuers, may be subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source. In this regard, withholding tax rates in countries with which the United States does not have a tax treaty are often as high as 35% or more. The United States has entered into tax treaties with many foreign countries that may entitle us to a reduced rate of tax or exemption from tax on this related income and gains. The effective rate of foreign tax cannot be determined at this time since the amount of our assets to be invested within various countries is not now known. We do not anticipate being eligible for the special election that allows a RIC to treat foreign income taxes paid by such RIC as paid by its stockholders. 
 If we acquire stock in certain foreign corporations that receive at least 75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such as interest, dividends, rents, royalties or capital gain) or hold at least 50% of their total assets in investments producing such passive income (“passive foreign investment companies”), we could be subject to U.S. federal income tax and additional interest charges on “excess distributions” received from such companies or gain from the sale of stock in such companies, even if all income or gain actually received by us is timely distributed to our stockholders. We would not be able to pass through to our stockholders any credit or deduction for such a tax. Certain elections may, if available, ameliorate these adverse tax consequences, but any such election requires us to recognize taxable income or gain without the concurrent receipt of cash. Additionally, to the extent we make such any such election, proposed Treasury regulations, if made final, would not treat the income we receive from passive foreign investment companies as qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test unless we receive a cash distribution from such entity during the same taxable year attributable to the income. We intend to limit and/or manage our holdings in passive foreign investment companies to minimize our tax liability.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Foreign exchange gains and losses realized by us in connection with certain transactions involving non-dollar debt securities, certain foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency option contracts, foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currencies, or payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency are subject to Code provisions that generally treat such gains and losses as ordinary income and losses and may affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to our stockholders. Any such transactions that are not directly related to our investment in securities (possibly including speculative currency positions or currency derivatives not used for hedging purposes) could, under future Treasury regulations, produce income not among the types of “qualifying income” from which a RIC must derive at least 90% of its annual gross income. 
Failure to Qualify as a Regulated Investment Company 
 If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions are applicable (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes or to dispose of certain assets). 
 If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and the foregoing relief provisions are not applicable, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. Distributions would not be required, and any distributions would be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and, subject to certain limitations, may be eligible for the 20% maximum rate for noncorporate taxpayers provided certain holding period and other requirements were met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. To requalify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the nonqualifying year, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized within the subsequent five years, unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level tax on such built-in gain at the time of our requalification as a RIC.
