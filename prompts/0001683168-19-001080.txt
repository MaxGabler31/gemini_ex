ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
The Company was originally incorporated on September 20, 2004 in the State of Delaware under the name “Blog8.” Since incorporation, we have changed our name a number of times, having been named “Securiteyes,” “Medify Solutions Limited,” “Petel Incorporated” and “Gleeworks, Inc.” and “Capital Art, Inc.” On June 6, 2018, we filed a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware in order to effectuate a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Globe Photos, Inc. As part of the merger, our board of directors authorized a change in our name from “Capital Art, Inc.” to “Globe Photos, Inc.” and our Certificate of Incorporation has been amended to reflect this name change.
 
We are currently engaged in the business of acquiring, selling, licensing and merchandising classic and contemporary photographic images and reproductions. Over the last few years, we have been in a developmental phase, focused mostly on acquiring ownership or rights to collections of rare or unpublished negatives and photographs of iconic celebrity images.
 
We have been taking advantage of a new market dynamic, where aging celebrities, retiring photographers, and image rights holders (i.e., family estates) are finally offering their exclusive photographic collections up for sale. We seized this opportunity to acquire these historic archives over the last few years, including the acquisition of other companies that have been quietly collecting these rare archives.
 
We believe we have now assembled one of largest collections of iconic pop culture imagery photography in the world. It is comprised of more than 15 million images taken by more than 3,500 photographers from around the world over the last century. It features iconic personalities and seminal moments from the worlds of entertainment, sports, history and politics. Our branded archives include Frank Worth collection, Movie Star News, and Globe Photos Agency (from the original Globe Photos founded in 1939).
 
Archived and stored at our Company’s secured warehouse, these collections include never before seen negatives, one-of-a kind prints and other memorabilia. They include rare images of celebrity icons, such as Elvis Presley, James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, Humphry Bogart, Frank Sinatra, the Beatles and more, as well as many contemporary personalities, performing artists and star athletes.
 
More recently we have been focused on acquiring assets that would provide us the ability to sell and merchandise licensed sports photography, as well as an operational platform for monetizing the photographic assets and associated memorabilia that we have acquired. This effort culminated on October 11, 2018 with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Photo File, Inc. (“Photo File”), a 30-year-old New York-based licensed sports photography company with more than 50 employees engaged in the licensing, production, marketing and sales of sports imagery and related collectibles.
 
As part of the Photo File transaction, we acquired licenses to produce and sell licensed sports prints, lithographs and other related items for major U.S. sports leagues, including NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL Properties and their respective player associations, as well as most major college sports teams. We also gained licenses with thousands of individuals and organizations, including Babe Ruth, Joe Namath, Vince Lombardi, Marvel Entertainment, and others. The acquisition also significantly expanded our collection of company-owned iconic sports photography.
 
In addition to valuable licenses and photo assets, the Photo File transaction has provided us access to its well-established sales and marketing organization, and it has opened new distribution channels for our existing product lines.
 
We also expect to benefit from Photo File’s reputation for excellent customer service, as well as its strong ties to its professional and collegiate sports leagues and large retail customers. This will be important as we further develop relationships with top retail clients and distributors including Costco, Walmart, Target, Bed Bath and Beyond, USPS, Scheels and others.

Prior to the Photo File transaction, we had taken preliminary steps to monetize the value of our collection by establishing various sales channels and marketing methodologies. We have been selling some of our photographic images and reproductions on a limited basis through auctions, third-party galleries, art consultants, interior decorators, brick and mortar locations, specialty and big box retailers, as well as through various online outlets, including Amazon and 1stdibs, and directly to end consumers via our Globe Photos website. We have been experimenting with various ways to reach customers through diverse marketing channels, including our websites, events and interactive campaigns.
 
In many respects, the Company believes it has turned the corner with the Photo File transaction, allowing us to emerge from our development stage into a full-scale commercialization phase and take advantage of the growing market demand for pop culture and sports imagery and related memorabilia.
 
Our mission is to operate as a global marketplace for licensed sports and pop culture imagery, which includes both sold physical prints as well as licensed digital photography that our customers can use in their communications, such as social media, websites, digital and print marketing materials, books and publications.
 
Through our online and in-store platforms and manufacturing processes, consumers are able to customize, personalize, share, print and download licensed prints and physical products both for personal use and for creating thoughtful and personalized gifts. These may include such photo-based products as framed photos, canvases, books, calendars, greeting cards, mugs, bags, and apparel. There are numerous ways for our customers to avail themselves of our vast library of digital images.
 
As part of increasing our product offerings, we plan to continue our search for photographic archives that are undervalued by the market. These archives may be acquired outright, or we may enter into representation or consignment agreements with the owners of the archives. These opportunities are typically (1) aging photographers who are looking to monetize their archive while still alive via a single large transaction, or (2) media companies that have aggregated assets (or rights to assets) and are seeking to dispose of the archive or a partner who can help them grow cash flows related to the archive. These opportunities exist both in the United States and abroad and we continue to search for value on a global basis.
 
Our principal place of business is located at 6445 South Tenaya Way, Suite B-130, Las Vegas, NV 89113. General information about us can be found at www.globephotos.com. The information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Prospectus.
 
Asset Purchase Agreement with Photo File
 
In 1987, the year it was founded, Photo File was awarded a license for photography by Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association, becoming the first company to be given a license for photography by any major sport in the United States. Photo File is also licensed by thousands of individuals and organizations, including Muhammad Ali, Babe Ruth, Joe Namath, Vince Lombardi, and Marvel Entertainment. Photo File had become one of the nation’s leading manufacturers of sports photography, with licenses from the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC), and their respective player associations.
 
Besides photos in sizes up to 30"x40", Photo File offered a full range of framed and matted products, plaques, photo sculptures, ceramics tiles, key chains and event covers. Photo File also produced a line of licensed Framed Gold Records featuring top recording artists, including Elvis Presley, KISS and many others.
 
At the time of the asset purchase by Globe Photos, Photo File employed 54 people, including its owners. The staff was comprised of 51 full-time and three part-time employees. Photo File’s 43,000 square foot facility, located in Mount Kisco, NY, included a printing lab, a graphics department, framing operation and sales and marketing divisions.

On October 11, 2018, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Photo File, along with its related company Sportphotos.com (collectively, the “Seller”) and Charles Singer, its CEO and principal stockholder, to acquire the assets of the 30-year-old private New York-based company.
 
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company and the seller agreed to the following purchase consideration:
 

§ | $2 million cash consideration as follows: $865,000 was advanced at the execution of the Purchase Agreement, which was secured through a pledge of 40% of the outstanding shares of the Seller; $650,000 was paid on the closing of the Agreement; and a $500,000 contingency payment shall be paid to Seller within 72 hours of receiving written consent from the major sports leagues; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
§ | A 10% interest in the Nevada subsidiary called Photo File, LLC that we have formed to house the assets; and 
§ | A royalty to Seller that commences upon the initial $6 million in sales from the Nevada subsidiary with a cap of $500,000 annually and $5 million in total. The royalty is calculated on annual sales beginning with the date of closing and will restart each year with no carry forward from one year to the next. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has recorded a contingent liability related to the royalty payout of $4,279,000. 
§ | Additionally, the Seller will endeavor to sell its Vintage Photographic Collection to a third party after Closing. If at the completion of the sale of the Vintage Photographic Collection, proceeds from the sale, but before any expenses other than commissions, are less than $2 million, Globe Photos will pay to the Seller the difference between such proceeds and $2 million within 30 days. Any proceeds from the sale, but before any expenses other than commissions, above $2 million will be divided equally between the Seller and Globe Photos with the Seller remitting 50% of such proceeds within 30 days of their receipt. 

 
Assets acquired in the Photo File transaction included more than 1 million sports negatives, prints and slides, more than 1,000 autographed lithographs and memorabilia, as well as printing and packaging equipment. Per the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we have created a new Nevada subsidiary called Photo File, LLC to hold the assets we have acquired from Photo File.
 
Post-Acquisition Plans
 
We see Photo File as a classic turnaround situation, during 2017 Photo File alone presented annual revenues of approximately $6.7 million and losses of approximately $1 million , but at one time having generated more than $20 million in annual revenues. Currently, of the approximately $7 million in revenue, only about 8% is generated online. We believe this represents a substantial opportunity to leverage the latest advances in e-Commerce technology and services to grow sales. Through our experience and our review of successful models of other major sports retailers, we determined that more than 80% of the business revenue should be generated by online, print-on-demand or direct-to-consumer sales.
 
We are also currently executing a plan to right size the organization and move forward efficiently and effectively. In conjunction with this analysis, we have evaluated areas and processes such as printing, production and fulfillment to reduce inefficiencies and further reduce overhead, along with expanding capacities. This review and integration will take place over a measured period as to not disrupt current operations and production. We have identified several viable options to outsource printing and grow the business by including individuals and companies currently working within the industry.
 
We believe the inclusion of a sports channel is complementary to our existing business and allows us to piggy back the photo assets of Globe Photos onto Photo File’s existing clients and retail opportunities. We plan to leverage the long-term distributor relationships Photo File has developed over the last 30 years to increase the sales of our existing Globe Photos library.

Business Strategy
 
We expect to become a major provider of licensed products and services by using a combination of traditional methods and merchandizing, along with innovative new approaches. Traditional methods, such as licensing, online downloads and subscriptions, and manufacturing and selling framed products, have built billion-dollar photo-based enterprises like Getty Images, Shutterstock and Shutterfly. However, with the aspiration to become the leader in our space, we are also developing new sales and marketing concepts that we believe will change the way people purchase images across online and retail channels. We expect our growth to be driven several initiatives:

§ | Develop our customer base: We plan to expand our customer base and promote our Globe Photos brand by leveraging our existing channels. This includes word-of-mouth referrals from customers, auctions, catalogs, online advertising and direct marketing that will continue to expand our customer reach. We plan to leverage the latest methods and technologies in social media and eCommerce marketing, including A.I. (artificial intelligence) to build out our customer database with valuable demographic and customer preference information in order to enhance our customer experience and increase sales. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Expand products and services offerings: We plan to innovate as a way to increase the breadth and value proposition of our products and services. We will continually explore new marketing possibilities, and have a number of programs at various stages of development. These programs are based on the strategy of leveraging industry partners and technology to lower or eliminate capital requirement for deployment and ongoing program management. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Increase sales to existing customers: We intend to increase both average order size and repeat orders per customer by expanding our products and services, tailoring our offerings to encourage additional purchases for different use occasions, and increasing our cross-selling and up-selling activities. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Growth through acquisitions: We will continue to consider strategic business or asset acquisitions that will help us secure additional photographic assets, products, market share, talent, and revenue. We continue to seek photographic archives that are undervalued, to purchase them or secure rights to these archives through representation or consignment agreements with the owners. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Expand our sports licenses. We are looking to expand our sports licenses to include more products related to the core licenses we currently have with the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL, as well as to expand our licensing relationships with additional major college teams and other sports organizations. We expect sales of products generated by the sport licensing part of our business, particularly with the launch of new sales and marketing concepts, to grow the fastest. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Expand upon and leverage partnerships: We plan to expand upon and leverage our retail and distribution partners that include Costco, Walmart, Bed Bath & Beyond and CVS. We also plan to increase our sales presence on Amazon and 1stdibs. We expect to expand upon our licensing partnerships with Wendover Art Group, Zuma Press, Artspace, Fanatics, PersonalizationMall.com and others.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
Our photographic assets and licenses are delivered or manufactured in a variety of physical and digital formats that can be sold through several different distribution channels and markets. This creates numerous potential revenue streams.
 
We sell photographs in the form of open edition or fine art prints. In some instances, prints can be paired with other memorabilia to create unique collectibles, such as photo footballs, original concert tickets, and autographed items.

Since we own many original prints and negatives, these prints can be also be paired with memorabilia or sold separately as collectibles after we digitize the original print or negative. We retain the exclusive copyright to the image, so we can then resell the digitalized image in different formats and sizes, and at different price-points, from digital download and postcard collectibles, to open edition prints and large-format fine art framed limited editions. We are not aware of any other pubic company that has as many original-source photo assets as Globe Photos.
 
To address opportunities created by the many varieties of products and distribution channels, we plan to expand our in-house sales staff as we scale up our commercialization efforts. Currently, approximately 90% of our licensed sports business is through major big-box and specialty retailers. We also reach customers through diverse marketing channels, including our website, events and interactive campaigns. Our marketing activities aim to build awareness for our brands and drive revenue by promoting both existing and newly-acquired images in our collection.
 
We are currently completing the development of a new robust enterprise web platform that will support the automation of product personalization and expand our online reach. We anticipate that a direct-to-consumer and print-on-demand approach will enable us to rapidly and efficiently scale our business while avoiding the costly investment and charges typically associated with the procurement and management of inventory and traditional manufacturing.
 
We plan to continue to implement marketing programs, although on a larger scale, designed to target non-traditional retail outlets, as well as the interior design, fund-raising and hospitality industries. We are also in discussions with several independent sales representatives to market the Company’s products to these market segments on a commission basis.
 
We also expect to continue to sell our pop culture photographic images and reproductions through auctions, third-party galleries, art consultants, interior decorators and directly to consumers. We will reproduce large quantities of different photographs from our collection, which may be sold through third party on-line retailers.
 
Our Globe Photos’ licensing division currently services more than 2,500 global clients, including every major news organization in the world, production companies, publishing houses and more. We have recently begun testing an online direct-to-consumer digital subscription model designed to license individual images for use in personal documents, prints, screen savers, and other uses.
 
We expect to generate significant growth over the next several years through interactive sales and marketing campaigns conducted in partnership with big-box and online retailers, including Wal-Mart, Costco and Fanatics, as well as fine art websites like 1stdibs.com, particularly as we take advantage of new sport photo licenses we acquired from Photo File. In fact, we anticipate the sport imagery aspect of our business will be the fastest growing area for us for the foreseeable future.
 
We plan to continue to pursue opportunities that can to diversify revenues, such as developing additional websites for retail clients to purchase our prints and also as a portal for interior decorators, and a new store-with-a-store gallery concept in New York City, New York and Santa Monica, California.
 
We are also developing an immersive interactive retail experience in partnership with a well-established industry player that is designed to require significantly small capital expenditure by Globe Photos, as our part will require use of our existing licenses, and overseeing fulfillment by outsourcing manufacturing, fulfillment and customer service. We expect this program to also provide the opportunity for customer acquisition at minimal to no cost, after which we can then remarket to them other products and services via our other channels, such as online.
 
Licenses
 
Our major sports licenses include NFL Properties, NFL Players Association, MLB Properties, MLB Players Association, NHL Properties, NHL Players Association, NBA Properties, and NBA Players Association, which comprise over 1,000 individual licenses to produce officially licensed sports prints, canvas, memorabilia and other related items.

In 2017, the Company entered into a licensing arrangement with Authentic Brands Group to license our images of Muhammad Ali, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis Presley, incorporating their respective signatures and iconic sayings onto the images, as “Officially Licensed Products.”
 
Intangible Assets; Photographic Image and Memorabilia Archive 
 
We believe we have now assembled one of largest collections of iconic pop culture imagery photography in the world. It is comprised of more than 15 million images taken by more than 3,500 photographers from around the world over the last century. It features iconic personalities and seminal moments from the worlds of entertainment, sports, history and politics. Our branded archives include Frank Worth collection, Movie Star News, and Globe Photos Agency (from the original Globe Photos founded in 1939).
 
Archived and stored at our Company’s secured warehouse, these collections include never before seen negatives, one-of-a kind prints and other memorabilia. They include rare images of celebrity icons, such as Elvis Presley, James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, Humphry Bogart, Frank Sinatra, the Beatles and more, as well as many contemporary personalities, performing artists and star athletes. The collection features iconic personalities and unforgettable moments from the worlds of entertainment, sports, history and politics.
 
We have been taking advantage of a new market dynamic, where aging celebrities, retiring photographers, and image rights holders (i.e., family estates) are finally offering their exclusive photographic collections up for sale. We seized this opportunity to acquire these historic archives over the last few years, including the acquisition of other companies that have been quietly collecting these rare archives.
 
The Company’s new Photo File division currently holds licenses with the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and major colleges including Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State and others, to produce sports prints, lithographs and other related items. Photo File also holds licenses for thousands of additional individuals and organizations, including Babe Ruth, Joe Namath, Vince Lombardi, and others.
 
The Company regards its archival images and related proprietary rights as valuable intangible assets. The Company, with the assistance of Corporate Valuation Advisors, Inc. (CVA), an independent appraiser, undertook an estimate of the value of the Company’s intangible assets.
 
The Company engaged CVA to value the identifiable assets acquired in the acquisition of Photo File in accordance with ASC 805, and separately from Globe Photo’s existing intangible assets, in order to assist with the accounting treatment for the combined entities.
 
The valuation of Photo File’s identifiable assets included memorabilia of $3.6 million, copyrighted image library of $4.1 million, tradename of $0.340 million, and other intangible assets including license agreements, customer relationships, and non-competes of $11.42 million. Altogether, CVA determined a total estimated value of the intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Photo File to be approximately $19.46 million.
 
Industry Overview
 
According to IBISWorld Industry Report OD5070 Online Art Sales in the U.S., IBISWorld estimated that over the next five years industry revenue will grow at an annualized rate of 3.5% to $597.2 million. The report points out how growth in macroeconomic conditions and the increased number of broadband connections have been the primary drivers of industry expansion over the last five years. Rapidly changing technology and the increasing acceptance of e-Commerce have shaped the online art sales industry over the last five years. IBISWorld projects the online art sales industry will continue to grow at an annualized rate of 3.2% over the next five years reflecting a slower rate of growth as the industry becomes more saturated and matures.

The art industry is subject to the same general economic conditions affecting the marketplace for branded products. When the economy is good, discretionary consumer spending increases. In economic downturns, consumers have less discretionary income and purchases of art products tends to decline.
 
Analysts at Technavio, a global technology research and advisory firm, forecast the global still images market at $4.46 billion by 2021, growing at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of close to 8% over the forecast period. The Americas is the leading regional segment of the market, responsible for generating the high revenue and incremental growth over the forecast period. The top three emerging trends driving the global still images market, according to Technavio’s consumer and retail research analysts are: 1) growth of microstock images; 2) increased demand for authenticity; and 3) growing popularity of premium still images with brand managers and publishers looking for images that are unique, culturally relevant, and provide fresh perspectives.
 
Technavio also expects the global market for personalized gifts will reach $31.63 billion by 2021, growing at a CAGR of more than 9%. Technavio analysts highlight the following three key factors that are contributing to the growth of the global personalized gifts market: 1) growing gifting culture and increasing demand for seasonal decorations; 2) innovative gifting solutions and advancements in technology; and 3) expanding online retail, kiosks, and online distribution channels. Technavio notes that gifting culture is evolving with an increasing number of occasions when gifts are exchanged. Consumers are looking to customize their gifts through personalization, configuration, or on-demand printing to add value and make their gifts unique. We have taken note of these trends, particularly personalization, and are currently designing innovative new programs designed to take advantage of them.
 
The recent acquisition of a controlling interest in Getty Images, Inc. by the Getty family from the Carlyle Group in a deal which reportedly values Getty Images at approximately $3 billion suggests an active market exists for copyrighted photographic libraries.
 
The U.S. sports memorabilia market is estimated at $5.4 billion annually, according to Collectible.com. This estimate considers the total gross merchandise volume from eBay, independent auction houses, online retail venues and other sources. According to Zion Market Research, the global licensed sports merchandise market was valued at approximately $31.3 billion in 2017 and is expected to reach approximately $48.7 billion by 2024, growing at a CAGR of about 6.56% from 2018 to 2024. Zion reports that sports licensing is one of the fastest growing categories worldwide, and it states that the rise in the number of sports leagues may help growth in licensed sports merchandise industry.
 
Furthermore, an article published in Fortune magazine on August 24, 2018 estimates the size of the U.S. sports licensed apparel market at approximately $7.8 billion per year, growing at a rate of 3% per year. Fanatics, Inc., an online retailer of licensed sportswear and merchandise, is believed to have grown from approximately $250 million in revenues in 2010 to an expected $2.3 billion in 2018. Fortune views the sports merchandise market as “ripe for e-commerce.” In the article, an analyst for IBISWorld claims that online sales of sports merchandise has grown from 1% of sales to 20% of sales over the past decade alone.
 
Competition 
 
Most of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. The market for iconic photographic images and related services is highly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors include our licenses, name recognition, company reputation, the quality, relevance and breadth of the content in a company’s collections, and the quality of contributing photographers and other partners under contract with a company. Additionally, we also face competition in connection with factors relating to the business and our infrastructure such as effective use of current and emerging technology, customer service and customer relationships, pricing and licensing models, policies and practices and accessibility of content and speed and ease of search and fulfillment.
 
Some of our current and potential significant competitors include other general visual content providers such as Getty and Shutterstock, and photo personalization providers like ShutterFly. We believe that we can be highly competitive with these companies because we own many of our photographic original prints and negatives, and therefore do not have to split sales proceeds with photographers who own intellectual property right which is a typical industry standard. Our competitors in this area could also potentially become license clients or partners, as they look to access the many unique images in our library.

-

 

We also face significant competition from specialized visual content companies that are well established in their local, content or product-specific market segments such as Reuters Group, the Associated Press, and ZUMA Press, Inc. There are also thousands of small photography agencies, image content aggregators and individual photographers throughout the world with whom we compete. Our Globe Photos’ licensing division is small in relation to these larger firms, but our photo assets have unique historical value with a name representing one of the nation’s first pop culture-licensing agencies founded in 1939. As a result, our licensing division services over 2,500 global clients, including every major news organization in the world, production companies, publishing houses and more.
 
Our competition also includes retail photography galleries and websites selling photography such as Art.com, Artspace.com and Rockpaperphoto.com. However, in some instances we have or can partner with these online sellers to also sell our products.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Much of our collection of iconic photographic images was acquired and are owned by us. A small percentage of the images in our collection are obtained through reproduction or licensing agreements, wherein we pay a royalty based on the percentage of revenues we receive from the use of the licensed images. As such, currently such agreements are limited and not material.
 
To this end, we have been and continue to search for photographic archives. We believe that these archives can be monetized multiple ways, through our collectibles, licensing and retail divisions, depending upon the structure and content of each archive. These archives may be acquired outright, or we may enter into representation or consignment agreements with the owners of the archives. These opportunities are typically (1) aging photographers who are looking to monetize their archive while still alive via a single large transaction, or (2) media companies that have aggregated assets (or rights to assets) and are seeking to dispose of the archive or a partner who can help them grow cash flows related to the archive. These opportunities exist both in the United States and abroad and we continue to search for value on a global basis.
 
Our management believes that the market is significantly undervaluing physical photographic assets for both individual photographers seeking to monetize their collections and media companies seeking to dispose of their archives because of the investment required to digitize and then monetize them. We have created an infrastructure and workflow process in order to digitize these assets at a low cost, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage for purchasing from all sources.
 
We utilize the following criteria when evaluating archives:
 

§ | The age of the archives;
--+-------------------------


§ | How/if the archive is organized;
--+---------------------------------


§ | The type of media in the archive;
--+----------------------------------


§ | The subject matter of the archive;
--+-----------------------------------


§ | The rarity of the subject matter;
--+----------------------------------


§ | The photographer(s) represented in the archive; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


§ | The nature and the strength of the intellectual property rights associated with the archive. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on these factors, single photographer archives are desirable because copyrights are most commonly owned by the person who photographed an image. We can market and build the reputation of the photographer to enhance the value of the archive. In addition, we believe we can better control the market for the works of individual photographers. Reproduction and licensing agreements are often more desirable because they typically require low or no upfront cash commitments. In these agreements, content providers are usually paid mostly through royalties on sales. Owning copyright or having rights to copyrights significantly impact our gross margins. On the other hand, purchasing copyrights outright while reducing cash, increases intangible assets and generates higher gross margins. Reproduction and licensing agreements do not significantly impact our balance sheet but generate lower gross margins.
 
Our ability to acquire such depository is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital in order to have funds to make such acquisitions.
 
Employees
 
As of April 12, 2019, we had approximately 48 employees. We also utilize consultants on an as-needed basis. None of our employees are members of any union. We believe our relationship with those employees is excellent. With the acquisition of the assets of Photo File, we acquired 45 employees (which number is included in the figure above). There will be an integration period over the coming months that will include employee retraining, and we anticipate an adjustment in the number of employees to “right size” the company in preparation for our next growth phase.
Government Regulations
 
We are subject to certain regulations as it relates to the Internet, data privacy and security. See “Risk Factors” for more information.
