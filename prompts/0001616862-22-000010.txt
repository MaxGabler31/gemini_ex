SEGMENT OVERVIEW
Performance Coatings
Through our Performance Coatings segment, we provide high-quality liquid and powder coatings solutions to both large regional and global original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and to a fragmented and local customer base. We are one of only a few suppliers with the technology to provide precise color matching and highly durable coatings systems. The end-markets within this segment are refinish and industrial.
Performance Coatings End-Markets
Refinish
Sales in the refinish end-market are driven by the number of vehicle collisions, owners' propensity to repair their vehicles, the number of miles vehicle owners drive and the size of the car parc. Although refinish coatings typically represent only a small portion of the overall vehicle repair cost, they are critical to the vehicle owner's satisfaction given their impact on appearance. As a result, body shop operators are most focused on coatings brands with a strong track record of performance and reliability. Body shops look for suppliers and brands with productivity enhancements, regulatory compliance, consistent quality, the presence of ongoing technical support and exact color match technologies. Color matching is a critical component of coatings supplier selection, since inexact matching adversely impacts vehicle appearance, and if repainting is required due to a poor match, it can reduce the speed and volume of repairs at a given shop.
We develop, market and supply a complete portfolio of innovative coatings systems and color matching technologies to facilitate faster automotive collision repairs relative to competing technologies. Our color matching technology provides Axalta-specific formulations that enable body shops to accurately match thousands of vehicle colors, regardless of vehicle brand, color, age or supplier of the original paint during production. It would be time consuming and costly for a new entrant to create such an extensive color inventory.
During 2021, we acquired U-POL Holdings Limited ("U-POL") a leading manufacturer of repair and refinish products used primarily for automotive refinish and aftermarket protective applications. The business produces a wide range of high-quality automotive refinishing products including fillers, aerosols, and adhesives as well as industry leading protective coatings. U-POL sells its products in over 100 countries and is widely known for its leading brands, including Raptor®, Dolphin®, and Gold™, among others. Axalta expects to accelerate the growth of U-POL's products by expanding market access through our existing sales and distribution channels while leveraging U-POL's distribution channels to extend the reach of its Refinish Coatings portfolio to new customers. U-POL's expertise in refinish accessories and protective coatings is highly complementary to Axalta's business and expands our addressable market into the important and growing mainstream and economy-based refinish segment as well as the consumer do-it-yourself aftermarket.

Performance Coatings Products and Brands
We offer a comprehensive range of specially-formulated waterborne and solventborne products and systems used by the global automotive refinish industry to repair damaged vehicles. Our refinish products and systems comprise a range of coatings layers, including fillers, aerosols and adhesives acquired with the 2021 U-POL acquisition, required to match the vehicle's color and appearance, producing a repair surface indistinguishable from the adjacent surface.
We provide systems that enable body shops to match more than 200,000 color variations, using a database with more than four million formulations, in the global market. Our color technology is manifested in the pigment and dispersion technology that are utilized in our tints, one of the most technologically advanced parts of the refinish coatings system, which makes up most of our products in a body shop. We have a large color library and several well-known, long-standing premium brands, including Cromax®, Standox®, Spies Hecker®, Syrox™, and Raptor®, as well as other regional and local brands. 
Our color matching and retrieval systems allow customers to quickly match any color, preventing body shop technicians from having to repeat the color matching process, saving time and materials. The color matching process begins with a technician scanning a damaged vehicle with one of our advanced color matching tools, such as our Acquire Plus EFX™ hand-held spectrophotometer. The Acquire Plus EFX reads the vehicle color, evaluating both the unique flake and color characteristics of the specific vehicle. These characteristics may vary significantly, even for vehicles of the same make, model and original color, due to a variety of factors, including a vehicle's age, plant at which it was assembled, weather conditions and operating history. The Acquire Plus EFX electronically connects with our ColorNet® database and generates for the body shop technician the precise mix of tints and colors needed to recreate that specific color for the part being repaired. In addition to the Acquire Plus EFX, we offer customers several other color matching tools, including our VINdicator® database, which identifies vehicle color based on its vehicle identification number, and traditional color matching fan decks. 
We are also a leading global developer, manufacturer and supplier of functional and decorative liquid and powder coatings for a large number of diversified applications in the industrial end-market. Through an acquisition completed in 2017, we have also become a leading manufacturer and supplier of coatings sold into the building materials, cabinet, wood and luxury vinyl flooring and furniture markets in North America. Our liquid systems are used to provide insulation and thermo-mechanical protection for electrical conductors and devices, protect automotive parts and serve as primers, basecoats, and clearcoats for alloy and steel wheels, and provide weatherability and corrosion protection for metal building and infrastructure projects. Powder coatings, both thermoset and thermoplastic, products are an environmentally responsible, higher transfer efficiency alternative to liquid coatings. These coatings are typically electrostatically sprayed using a specialized spray gun and cured to create a uniform, high-quality finish. In the oil & gas industry, our powder and liquid products are used to protect components from corrosion and severe conditions such as extreme temperatures, pressures, and harsh chemicals.
Our major industrial brands include Imron® Industrial, Tufcote™ Industrial, Corlar™ Industrial, Strenex™ Industrial, PercoTop®, Voltatex®, AquaEC™, Durapon®, Hydropon™, UNRIVALED™, and Ceranamel® for liquid coatings and Alesta®, Teodur®, Nap-Gard®, Abcite® and Plascoat® for powder coatings.
Performance Coatings Sales, Marketing and Distribution
We leverage a large global refinish sales and technical support team to effectively serve our broad refinish customer base of approximately 80,000 body shops. Most of our products are supplied by our network of approximately 4,000 independent local distributors. In select regions, including parts of Europe, we also sell directly to body-shop customers. Distributors maintain an inventory of our products to fill orders from body shops in their market and assume credit risk and responsibility for logistics, delivery and billing. In certain countries, we utilize importers that buy directly from us and actively market our products to body shops. Our relationships with our top ten distributors are longstanding and continue to contribute to our success in the global refinish market.
Our large sales force manages relationships directly with our end-customers to drive demand for our products, which in turn are purchased through customers in our distributor network. Due to the local nature of the refinish industry, our sales force operates on a regional/country basis to provide clients with responsive customer service and local insight.

These customers also look for suppliers that offer sustainable solutions that aid in the customer portfolio transformation and can enhance process efficiency to improve productivity and provide superior technical service support. Rigorous environmental and durability testing as well as obtaining engineering approvals are also key criteria used by global light vehicle OEMs when selecting coatings providers. Globally integrated suppliers are important because they offer products with consistent standards across regions and are able to deliver high-quality products in sufficient quantity while meeting OEM service requirements. Our global scale, people expertise, innovative technology platforms, and customer focus, position us to be a global partner and solutions provider to the most discerning and demanding light vehicle OEMs. We are one of the few coatings producers that can provide OEMs with global product specifications, standardized color development, compatibility with an ever-increasing number of substrates, automotive plastics supplies, increasingly complex colors and environmentally responsible coatings while continuing to simplify and reduce steps in the coating application process.
Commercial Vehicle
Sales in the commercial vehicle end-market are generated from a variety of applications, including non-automotive transportation (i.e., HDT, bus and rail), motorcycles, marine and aviation, as well as related markets such as trailers, recreational vehicles and personal sport vehicles. This end-market is primarily driven by global commercial vehicle production, which is influenced by overall economic activity, government infrastructure spending, equipment replacement cycles and evolving environmental standards for sustainability.
Commercial vehicle OEMs select coatings providers on the basis of their ability to consistently deliver advanced technological solutions that improve exterior appearance, protection and durability and provide extensive color libraries and matching capabilities at the lowest total cost-in-use, while meeting stringent environmental requirements. Particularly for HDT applications, truck owners demand a significant variety of custom colors and advanced product technologies to enable custom designs. Our strong market position and growth are driven by our ability to provide customers with our market-leading brand, Imron®, as well as leveraging our global product lines, regional knowledge and service.
Mobility Coatings Products and Brands
We develop and supply a complete coatings product line for light vehicle OEMs. Our products are designed to enhance the styling and appearance of a vehicle's exterior while providing protection from the elements, extending the life of the vehicle. Widely recognized in the industry for our advanced and patented technologies, our products not only increase productivity and profitability for OEMs but also produce attractive and durable finishes. Our light vehicle coatings portfolio is one of the broadest in the industry.
The coatings operation is a critical component of the vehicle assembly process, requiring a high degree of precision, speed and productivity. The paint shop process typically includes a dip process, three application zones and three high-temperature ovens that cure each coating layer at temperatures ranging from 320°F to 400°F (i.e., "high bake"). Our key products consist of the four main coatings layers: electrocoat (AquaEC™), primer (HyperDur™), basecoat (ChromaDyne™) and clearcoat (Lumeera™). 
The coatings process accounts for a majority of the total energy consumed during the vehicle manufacturing process. As a result, we have developed Harmonized Coating TechnologiesTM, including 3-Wet, Eco-Concept and 2-Wet Monocoat, that help our OEM customers lower costs by reducing energy consumption while increasing productivity. 
In today's existing transportation ecosystem, coatings provide essential beauty and color to vehicle bodies while adding corrosion and impact protection. As the industry evolves, each dimension of mobility – electric vehicles, shared transportation and autonomous driving – requires coatings with advanced functionality that, in addition to aesthetics and protection, contributes to the efficiency of electrification, vehicle design, navigation and passenger safety, among other areas. The evolution of mobility creates tremendous opportunities for OEMs but requires them to undertake significant shifts in how they design and produce vehicles. OEMs are also increasingly looking to reduce the weight of vehicles in response to increasing vehicle emissions and fuel consumption regulations. As a result, OEMs are constructing vehicle platforms using a variety of new materials in addition to steel and plastic, including aluminum, carbon fiber and other substrates, LiDAR and Radar sensory, each of which requires specialized coatings formulations to create a uniform color and finish. We continue to innovate with our OEM customers in driving this trend, as evidenced by use of our coatings on their flagship vehicle platforms.
We also develop and supply a wide array of coatings systems for a broad range of commercial vehicle applications including HDT, bus and rail. These products simultaneously enhance aesthetic appearance and provide protection from the elements. We meet the demands of commercial vehicle customers with our extensive offering of over 75,000 different colors. In the HDT market, because the metal and composite components are painted simultaneously in an automatic process, most truck OEMs use low bake coatings to ensure that the plastic composite parts on a truck's exterior do not deform during the bake process. Truck owners demand a wide variety of custom colors that are formulated using a combination of on-site mixing machines at the OEM or direct shipments of premixed high-volume colors from us. Our commercial vehicle brands include Imron®, Imron Elite®, Centari®, Rival®, Corlar® epoxy undercoats and AquaEC™.

KEY RAW MATERIALS 
We use thousands of different raw materials, which fall into seven broad categories: liquid resins, powder resins, pigments, solvents, monomers, isocyanates and additives. On average, our total raw material spend represents between 40% and 50% of our cost of sales, even during 2021 despite significant raw material inflation experienced throughout the year. We purchase raw materials from a diverse group of suppliers, with our top ten suppliers representing approximately 33% of our 2021 spending on raw materials. 
Approximately 65% of the raw materials we procure are derived from crude oil and natural gas. While prices for these raw materials fluctuate with energy prices, such fluctuations are somewhat mitigated by the fact that the majority of our raw materials are fourth to sixth generation derivatives of crude oil and natural gas. The dynamics of supply and demand play a much more critical role in our cost of raw materials than just the price of crude oil. Non-petrochemical based inputs such as minerals that are used to manufacture coating pigments are not significantly affected by volatility in crude oil prices but tend to be impacted by the supply-demand dynamics of their industry.
Historically, to manage raw material volatility, we have used a combination of price increases to customers and, in certain limited circumstances, contractual raw material recovery mechanisms. Since 2001, our variable cost of sales has remained stable between 35% and 45% of net sales, even during 2021 despite significant raw material inflation experienced throughout the year. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Our focus on technology has allowed us to proactively provide customers with next-generation offerings that enhance product performance, improve productivity and satisfy increasingly strict environmental regulations. Since our entry into the coatings industry over 150 years ago, we believe we have consistently been at the forefront of coatings technology innovation. These innovations have played a fundamental role in our ability to maintain and grow our global market share as well as deliver substantial financial returns.
We believe that we are a technology leader well positioned to benefit from continued industry shifts in customer needs. Our markets are among the most demanding in the coatings industry with high levels of product performance that continuously evolves, with increasing expectations for productivity on customer lines and with environmentally responsible products. Our technology development is led by a highly experienced and educated workforce that is focused on new product development, color development, technical customer support and improving our manufacturing processes. As such, our technology development covers two critical interrelated aspects for us, research and development as well as technical support and manufacturing. In total, as of December 31, 2021, we have approximately 1,300 people dedicated to technology development. We operate four major technology centers throughout the world where we develop and align our technology investments with regional business needs complemented by approximately 28 regional laboratories which provide local connection to our global customer base. This includes our Global Innovation Center located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which opened in 2018 for global research, product development and technology initiatives.
PATENTS, LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS
As of December 31, 2021, we had a global portfolio of approximately 740 issued patents and more than 480 trademarks. We actively apply for and obtain U.S. and foreign patents and trademarks on new products and process innovations and as of December 31, 2021, approximately 230 patent applications were pending throughout the world.

Axalta is committing to deliver sustainability benefits from 80 percent of its new technology and innovation developments by 2030 and increasing, by at least 20 percent, the total percentage of net sales derived from products, services, and tools that offer sustainability benefits.
•People Solutions: Building on Axalta's corporate culture, which is rooted in inclusivity, integrity, safety, and engagement, this third pillar will ensure that the Company continues operating and fostering an environment where all of our people can thrive. The Company is committing to creating a more diverse and inclusive environment that results in increasing the representation of women in management positions globally to at least 30 percent by 2030. Axalta will continue to support its local communities via its Bright Futures Program, which includes STEM and vocational scholarships.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our success is realized through the engagement and commitment of our people. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 13,000 team members, including 12,000 employees and 1,000 contractors, with 25% of our team members based in the U.S. and 75% based in international locations. Our workforce is distributed globally, with approximately 44% in the Americas, 39% in EMEA and 17% in Asia Pacific.
Axalta's ability to attract, develop and retain highly skilled talent requires us to focus on the growth and well-being of each team member. As a global coatings manufacturer, we have a wide range of employees, including but not limited to management professionals, scientists, technicians, engineers, sales, technical, manufacturing operations, supply chain, administrative and customer service personnel. We drive to create a performance-driven culture where employees feel included and find a sense of belonging. It is also important that we provide an environment that fosters inclusivity and embraces diversity where everyone feels they have a voice and their contributions are valued. In support of this, our first all employee engagement survey took place in 2021. Capturing the voice of our employees through this survey provided actionable insights into the specific tools, processes, and other factors that enable our employees to perform at their best.
We strive to provide a wide variety of opportunities for growth for our employees, including online trainings, on-the-job experience, education tuition assistance and financial counseling. We also aim to provide competitive compensation and benefits across all of our global locations. 
In addition, the health and well-being of our employees is foundational to Axalta's success. In 2020, we launched "Flex Your Work", a program that is intended to support the work-life balance of our office-based employees by allowing them to work from home up to two days a week. We are also committed to providing a workplace that enables team members to operate safely, including safety protocols to ensure the health and safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. Safety is ingrained in the way we do business and our safety program is structured on the foundation that every employee is engaged and committed to improving safe operating practices and eliminating injuries. When health and safety incidents do occur, we strive to determine the causes and eliminate the potential for future similar incidents. In 2021, Axalta's injury and illness performance resulted in a 0.24 OSHA Recordable Incident Rate ("TRIR"), compared to the 1.6 OSHA Recordable Incident Rate for the Paint and Coating Manufacturing Industry (according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics 2020 data). An internal review revealed that, for 2017-2020, we had miscalculated our TRIR. Our TRIR for each of 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, as recalculated, was 0.40, 0.46, 0.30 and 0.16, respectively. 
The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight of the Company's human capital management efforts. The Environment, Health, Safety and Sustainability Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight of the Company's policies to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors, and this committee regularly reviews data on our safety metrics and performance.
We encourage you to visit the sustainability section, and other sections, of our website for more detailed information regarding our human capital resources, programs, and initiatives. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
Our business is subject to significant regulations in all of the markets that we operate and we are committed to operating our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
Environmental
We are subject to applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and workers' safety, including those required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Our Environment, Health, Safety ("EHS") and Sustainability policies and standards are a key element of the foundation upon which we develop, market, manufacture, and distribute products and services to our global customers. In 2017, we established a Board-level committee responsible for the oversight of our EHS and Sustainability policies, performance, strategy and compliance matters. We operate our manufacturing facilities using a common set of internal standards. These standards support a consistent approach to EHS and Sustainability performance improvement. We strive to assure that all our manufacturing and distribution facilities are operated in compliance in all known material respects to applicable environmental requirements. Investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal recurring part of our operations.
