Our Company

The Company offers a specialty branded selection of high-quality proprietary loose-leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets, tea-related accessories and gifts through its e-commerce platform at www.davidstea.com and the Amazon Marketplace, its wholesale customers which include over 3,500 grocery stores and pharmacies, and 18 company-owned stores across Canada. The Company offers primarily proprietary tea blends that are exclusive to the Company, as well as traditional single-origin teas and herbs. Our passion for and knowledge of tea permeates our culture and is rooted in an excitement to explore the taste, health and lifestyle elements of tea. With a focus on innovative flavours, wellness-driven ingredients and organic tea, the Company launches seasonally driven “collections” with a mission of making tea fun and accessible to all. 

Sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Sales are traditionally highest in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the year-end holiday season and tend to be lowest in the second and third fiscal quarters because of lower customer engagement during the summer months.

Our Market and Competition

We participate in a large and growing global tea market which, combined with the relatively low percentage of tea sales in North America, makes the market opportunity very attractive. The markets for tea products in Canada and the United States are highly fragmented and we compete with many relatively small independently owned tea retailers and several regional tea retailers, as well as retailers of grocery products, including loose‑leaf teas, tea sachets and tea-related beverages. We also compete with other vendors of loose‑leaf teas, tea sachets and ready‑to‑drink teas, such as club stores, wholesalers, and internet suppliers, as well as with houseware retailers and suppliers that offer tea wares and related accessories.

We believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors because we are considered by our customers as tea experts and by the excellence of our blended and straight teas, through our distinct retail experience, our broad product offering that ranges from loose leaf tea to in-store craft beverages, the potential broad demographic appeal of our brand, innovative tea products driven by customer insights, the effectiveness of our online store, www.davidstea.com, and digital and community focused events, and our passionate customer-focused culture supported by our experienced management team and dedicated board members.

Our Product Offerings

We offer a significant variety of premium loose‑leaf teas, and pre-packaged teas, tea sachets, tea-related gift’s and accessories. We also offer on‑the‑go craft tea beverages in our retail stores.
Teas

Our loose‑leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts can be enjoyed by consumers at home, on‑the‑go or at work. Our different flavors of loose-leaf tea span eight different tea categories: white, green, oolong, black, pu’erh, mate, rooibos, and herbal tea. Our tea collection features over 30% certified organic teas, and to our knowledge makes us the largest organic loose-leaf provider on the market. We carry only responsibly sourced and fairtrade certified blends. Our teas and ingredients used in our tea blends are sourced from various regions around the world, including from China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, India, Nepal, Kenya, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Thailand and Canada. In addition to loose‑leaf teas, we sell pre‑packaged teas and tea sachets to make the tea experience more convenient. Our tea-related gifts include special edition seasonal and holiday gift packages as well as novelty themed gifts that continue to innovate with new themes, seasonal collections and visually appealing gift boxes designed for entertaining. Our tea gifts are substantially all either fully recyclable or compostable. 
Tea Accessories

Our tea accessories are created to make the tea preparation process and tea experience more convenient, fun, and easy at home or on-the-go. Tea accessories include tea mugs, travel mugs, teacup sets, teapots, tea makers, kettles, infusers, filters, frothers, tins and spoons. Many of our accessories are crafted with unique functional features to improve tea preparation and consumption as well as with visually appealing colors and designs consistent with our brand aesthetic. 
Distribution Channels

We have strategically pivoted the organization to serve consumer demand by leveraging our digital channels supported by emerging omni-channel fulfillment capabilities, including by online pick-up in store and curbside pick-up. These strategies align with rapidly evolving consumer preferences as we refocus our energies to provide consumers with an enhanced shopping experience on our online channels. We believe our continued efforts to transform our business to a digital first organization will improve our customer experience, our overall performance, and ultimately position us for long-term growth.
Digital Retail

Our online store, www.davidstea.com, features our full assortment of premium loose‑leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts and accessories. To drive increased sales through our website, we utilize online‑specific marketing and promotions in addition to employing banner advertisements, search engine optimization and pay‑per‑click arrangements on various social media platforms to help drive customer traffic to our website. The use of influencers and affiliates with like-minded brands are also helping to attract customers to our online store.  We periodically enhance our online store with new features and functionality to improve our customers’ experience and accessibility for mobile users. We have also launched a select assortment on the Amazon Marketplace that complements our full product assortment on our online store. 
Wholesale 

We sell our tea and related products to premium grocery and drugstore chains throughout Canada.  We believe that the broad distribution of select tea blends helps to service not only existing customers but also attract new customers to our exclusive sachet tea offerings, while ultimately also driving greater brand awareness and traffic to our online and retail stores where our full selection of products including loose-leaf tea blends and packaged gifts become available.  In Fiscal 2021, demand from hotels, restaurants and various other office and corporate customers was softened by the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.   
Retail Stores

Over the last decade, our brand connected with consumers and created a reputation of quality and innovation driven primarily from our in-store experience.  The secular decline in retail and consumers’ move to many things digital has significantly impacted our business.  We continue our transition to a digital first organization, complemented by select stores strategically located throughout Canada and we continue to re-invent our in-store experience.

Our retail footprint consists of 18 mall-based stores in Canada. Each store exterior prominently displays the DAVIDsTEA teal signage and our in-store Tea Guides’ passion for tea and wellness permeate our culture. A key element of the retail experience is our “Tea Wall,” a focal point of the store. Our Tea Guides help to create a highly interactive and immersive multi-sensory experience for our customers. The Tea Guides facilitate customers’ interaction with our products through education and sampling, which allows our customers the opportunity to appreciate the compelling attributes of tea as well as the ease of preparation. 

Marketing and Advertising

We use a variety of marketing and advertising mediums to drive brand health, customer acquisition, and engagement. We leverage our customer database and respond to shopping behaviors and needs with content across email, site, and digital media to drive relevance and urgency. Our diversified media mix spans traditional to digital to social media. We focus on productivity of marketing investment to drive increased effectiveness.

We are focused on amplifying all marketing and advertising efforts to help build brand awareness and increase sales on our digital platforms. Such marketing efforts include communications with our Super Steeper and Frequent Steeper loyalty members and using paid and non-paid media programs to help create demand on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok and Yelp.  

COVID-19 has impacted our in-store marketing efforts due to the social distancing and other regulatory requirements and protocols. Notwithstanding this, we differentiate our business through a field‑based marketing approach to build brand awareness and drive customers to our stores and website in both new and existing markets. 

Product Development and Design

Our tea and merchandising teams seek premium teas and tea-related products from around the world.  These teams consist of Tea Blend Developers, Product Designers, Category Merchants and Quality Control Personnel, who leverage our extensive experience in selecting and developing our product assortment. We constantly explore distinctive ingredients, flavors and trends that are popular in a variety of cultures, which we introduce to our customers through their incorporation in new teas. Our research and development team works with our blenders and suppliers to create new and exciting flavors of tea, which we rotate into our product offerings to attract new customers and to continue to pique the interest of existing customers. Our blending process focuses on magnifying the senses and bringing smell and taste to the forefront. We introduce new flavors and blends each month as well as seasonal holidays blends. Through extensive research, we have identified key customer segments and preferences to help evaluate our product assortment and we have developed an effective product release cadence. We believe our focus on innovation and continual product development are key differentiating factors for our brand that drives our customers’ loyalty and supports our efforts to attract new customers.

Travel restrictions brought on by COVID-19 have not impacted our ability to develop new products and innovate, due primarily to strong relationships built over the years with our suppliers, including our significant library of untapped new blends and products that we can bring to market as required.

Our innovation also extends to creating new and exciting merchandise to make the tea consumption and experience more convenient and stimulating at home or on-the-go. Since our merchandising team designs and develops most of our products in‑house, we believe we are better positioned than our competitors who do not have such an in-house function to create the unique and proprietary designs that make consuming loose‑leaf tea easier and more enjoyable for our customers. We believe the combination of our product selection and our product innovation allows us to offer customers a distinctive assortment that differentiates us from other specialty tea retailers.

Sourcing and Manufacturing

We do not own or operate any tea estates or blending operations; instead, we work with vendors who source ingredients for our teas and tea blends from all over the world. Many of our tea blenders are in either Germany or the United States. Since we founded the Company in 2008, we have developed strong relationships with our vendors. These relationships are important, as we depend on our vendors to provide us with the highest quality teas and ingredients from around the world. Our quality control process includes both in-house testing and vendor testing. Therefore, in addition to bringing our designs for tea blends to fruition, our vendors play an important role in quality control and in ensuring our teas meet applicable regulatory guidelines. Our tea merchandise is sourced from several suppliers who manufacture to our unique and proprietary designs.

Warehouse and Distribution Facilities

We distribute our loose-leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets, tea-related gifts and, accessories to our stores and our online customers from third-party distribution centers.  In September 2021, we consolidated the North American distribution of our products to one facility located in Longueuil, Québec, Canada.  Prior to this, the Company distributed products throughout Canada from Sherbrooke, Québec and throughout the U.S. from Champlain, New York using third-party logistics facilities in these locations. Our products are typically shipped to our customers via third‑party national transportation providers multiple times per week. 

We also assemble finished goods from our production facility located in Montreal, Québec. COVID-19 has heighted the importance of our health and safety protocols on our production, warehouse, and distribution facilities. Social distancing and other health and safety requirements, including cleanliness protocols, have put constraints on our production capacity, which we have addressed through additional operating shifts and automating manual processes where possible. 

Management Information Systems

Our management information systems provide a full range of business process supports to our online and retail stores, our store operations and service support center teams. Additionally, we operate our website on an independent platform. We utilize a combination of industry‑standard and customized software systems to provide various functions related to point of sales, inventory management, warehouse management, and accounting and financial reporting.
Government Regulation

      We are subject to labor and employment laws, import and trade restrictions laws, laws governing advertising, privacy and data security laws, safety regulations, and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that apply to retailers and/or the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. In the United States, we are subject to the regulatory authority of, among other agencies, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). We are also subject to the laws of Canada, including the regulatory authority of Canadian Food Inspection Agency, as well as provincial and local regulations. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws.
Insurance

We maintain third-party insurance for a number of risk management activities including, but not limited to, workers’ compensation, general liability, property, directors and officers, cyber insurance and employee-related health care benefits. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure that we maintain adequate levels of coverage. 
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property

We regard intellectual property and other proprietary rights as important to our success. In addition to registered intellectual property, such as our patents and marks, we also rely upon trade secrets and know‑how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our intellectual property rights through a variety of methods, including by availing ourselves of trademark and trade secret laws and by entering into confidentiality agreements with vendors, employees, consultants, and others who have access to our proprietary information.

We own several trademarks and service marks that have been registered with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including DAVIDsTEA®. We have also registered our stylized logos, and we own domain names, including www.davidstea.com. In addition, we have registered or have applied to register one or more of our marks in several foreign countries and expect to continue to do so in the future. However, we cannot be certain that we can obtain the registration for the marks in every country where we apply for registration.

We must constantly protect against any infringement by competitors. If we believe a competitor has infringed or is infringing upon our rights, we may take legal action, which could result in litigation, in which case we may incur significant expenses and divert significant management attention from our business operations.

Human Capital

As of January 29, 2022, we employed a total of 204 full‑time employees and 174 part‑time employees in Canada. Of those employees, 133 were employed in our corporate office, 69 in our production and distribution operations and 176 in our store network. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. 

Our employees are united by our goal of infusing people’s lives with positivitea. Our human capital resources objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining and incentivizing our existing and new employees. We foster a people-first approach through connection and collaboration, focusing on mental & physical wellness, diversity and inclusion, family, sustainability, and community involvement. We offer hybrid and flexible work options, generous time off and professional development and training. We believe that fostering this openness and flexibility within our organization is how we encourage a collaborative work environment resulting in new ideas and continuous improvement.

Seasonality

Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations, reflecting increased sales during the holiday season in November and December. Our sales and income are generally highest in the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday sales period, and tends to be lowest in the second and third fiscal quarters. Therefore, operating results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year. To prepare for the holiday season, we must increase our inventory levels above those maintained during the rest of the year. We expect inventory levels, along with an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, to reach their highest levels in the third and fourth quarters in anticipation of the increased net sales during the holiday season. As a result of this seasonality, and generally because of variations in consumer spending habits, we experience fluctuations in net sales, earnings/(losses) and working capital requirements during the year.
