Item 1. Business
The Company
We are a leading global property information, analytics and data-enabled software platforms and services provider operating in North America, Western Europe and Asia Pacific. Our vision is to deliver unique property-level insights that power the global real estate economy. Our mission is to empower our clients to make smarter decisions through data-driven insights.
With our data as a foundation, we provide software platforms and value-added business services that address the unique needs of the mortgage, real estate, insurance, capital markets, public sector and rental property markets. We believe the quality of the software platforms and services we offer is distinguished by our broad range of data sources and our experience in aggregating, organizing, normalizing, processing and delivering data. Our databases include over 900 million historical property transactions, over 100 million mortgage applications and property-specific data covering approximately 99% of the United States ("US") residential properties, as well as commercial locations, totaling over 150 million records. We are also the industry's first parcel-based geocoder and have developed a proprietary parcel database covering more than 150 million parcels across the US. These databases provide our clients with detailed coverage of property, mortgages and other encumbrances, property risk and replacement cost, consumer credit, tenancy, location, hazard risk and related performance information. 
We have more than one million users who rely on our data and predictive decision analytics to reduce risk, enhance transparency and improve the performance of their businesses.
We offer our clients a comprehensive national database covering real property and mortgage information, judgments and liens, building and replacement costs, parcel and geospatial data, criminal background records, eviction information, non-prime lending records, credit information, and tax information, among other data types. Using these robust datasets, we have built strong value-added analytics capabilities and business services to meet our clients’ needs for property tax processing, property valuation, mortgage and automotive credit reporting, tenancy screening, hazard risk, property risk and replacement cost, flood plain location determination and other geospatial data, analytics and related services.
We became a stand-alone public company on June 1, 2010 when we completed a transaction in which we separated from the financial services businesses of our predecessor company, The First American Corporation ("FAC") (referred to as the "Separation"). To effect the Separation, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement (“Separation and Distribution Agreement”) that governs the rights and obligations of us and First American Financial Corporation ("FAFC") regarding the distribution. It also governs the on-going relationship between us and FAFC subsequent to the completion of the Separation and provides for the allocation of assets and liabilities between us and FAFC. In addition, we also entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement (“Tax Sharing Agreement”) with FAC and FAFC. FAC was incorporated in California in 1894, and as part of the Separation, we reincorporated in Delaware on June 1, 2010, changed our name to CoreLogic, Inc. and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CLGX.” As used herein, the terms "CoreLogic," the "Company," "we," "our" and "us" refer to CoreLogic, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries, except where it is clear that the terms mean only CoreLogic, Inc. and not our subsidiaries. Our executive offices are located at 40 Pacifica, Irvine, California, 92618-7471, our telephone number is (949) 214-1000, and our website is www.corelogic.com.
Corporate Events
Business Exits & Transformation 
In December 2018, we announced the intent to exit a loan origination software unit and its remaining legacy default management related platforms over the next 24 months, as well as accelerate an appraisal management company transformation program. We believe these actions will expand our overall profit margins and provide for enhanced long-term organic growth trends. We will assess and may incur cash and non-cash charges associated with these actions.
Acquisitions
We acquire, on an opportunistic basis, companies, businesses, products and services, to grow market share in the mortgage, real estate, insurance, capital markets, public sector and rental property markets. We also identify opportunities that complement our strengths and/or diversifies our exposure from the mortgage and real estate market.
 3

During 2018, we completed the acquisitions of eTech Solutions Limited ("eTech"), a la mode technologies, LLC ("a la mode"), Breakaway Holdings, LLC ("HomeVisit") and Symbility Solutions Inc. ("Symbility") for total net cash of approximately $219.6 million. eTech is a leading provider of innovative mobile surveying and workflow management software that enhances productivity and mitigates risk for participants in the U.K. valuation market. The acquisition of eTech expands our U.K. presence and strengthens our technology platform offerings. a la mode is a provider of subscription-based software solutions that facilitate the aggregation of data, imagery and photographs in a government-sponsored enterprise compliant format for the completion of US residential appraisals. The acquisition of a la mode contributes to our continual development and scaling of our end-to-end valuation solutions workflow suite, which includes data and market insights, analytics as well as data-enabled services and platforms. HomeVisit is a leading provider of marketing focused real estate solutions, including property listing photography, videography, 3D modeling, drone imagery and related services. Given anticipated synergy with our pre-existing real estate solutions platforms, the acquisition of HomeVisit is expected to enable the next generation of property marketing solutions for real estate professionals, MLS, brokers and agents across North America. Symbility is a leading global provider of cloud-based property claims workflow solutions for the property and casualty insurance industry, headquartered in Canada. The acquisition of Symbility further progresses our long-term strategic plan by adding scale to our insurance and spatial businesses and international presence. See Note 17 - Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.    

Technology Transformation
In September 2018, we announced the adoption of the Google Cloud Platform ("GCP") as a foundational element of our ongoing technology transformation program to further expand infrastructure capabilities and drive efficiencies. We expect to complete the initial deployment of GCP over the next 24 months. Once implemented, CoreLogic plans to leverage the capabilities of the cloud platform to achieve best-in-class system performance and reliability and to facilitate the deployment of unique business insights fueled by gold-standard data, information and analytics. Additionally, we expect to realize significant cost efficiencies and enhanced security.
Our Data
Our data is the foundation of many of our products, analytics and services, and can generally be categorized as property information, mortgage information and consumer information. We obtain our data from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to, data gathered from public sources, data contributed by our clients and data obtained from data aggregators.
We gather a variety of data from public sources, including data and documents from federal, state and local governments. We enhance our public record information with the data we collect from other public and non-public sources to create comprehensive textual and geospatial views of each property within our coverage areas, including physical property characteristics, boundaries and tax values, current and historical ownership, voluntary and involuntary liens, tax assessments and delinquencies, replacement cost, property risk including environmental, flood and hazard information, criminal data, building permits, local trends and summary statistics.
Our client agreements typically govern the use of our client-contributed data. These contractual arrangements often permit our clients to use our solutions which incorporate their data. We generally structure our client agreements to specify the particular uses of the data our clients contribute and to provide the required levels of data privacy and protection. Our contributed data includes loan performance information (from loan servicers, trustees, securitizers, issuers and others), appraisal information, information regarding property rental and under-banked loan applications from various loan originators, and information regarding landlords and property owners. 
In addition, we gather property listing and tenant/landlord rental information from Boards of Realtors®, real estate agents, brokers, landlords, and owners of multi-tenant properties. We collect appraisals and property valuations from appraisers and we license consumer credit history information from credit reporting agencies, lenders and auto dealers.
Business Segments
We have organized our business into the following two segments: Property Intelligence & Risk Management Solutions ("PIRM") and Underwriting & Workflow Solutions ("UWS"). 
We believe that we hold the leading market position for many of our solutions, including:
 4


• | property tax processing, based on the number of loans under service;


• | flood zone determinations, based on the number of flood zone certification reports issued;


• | credit and income verification services to the US mortgage lending industry, based on the number of credit reports issued;


• | property valuation and technology platform solutions, based on the number of in-house staff appraisers and inquiries received; and


• | multiple listing services ("MLS"), based on the number of active desktops using our technology.

In addition to our two reporting segments, we also have a corporate group, which includes costs and expenses not allocated to our segments. More detailed financial information regarding each of our business segments is included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as Note 18 - Segment Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of Part II of this report.
Solutions
Property Intelligence & Risk Management Solutions
Our PIRM segment delivers unique housing market and property-level insights, predictive analytics and risk management capabilities. We have also developed proprietary technology and software platforms to access, automate or track this information and assist our clients with decision-making and compliance tools in the real estate industry, insurance industry and the single and multifamily industry. We deliver this information directly to our clients in a standard format over the web, through hosted software platforms or in bulk data form. Our solutions include property insights and insurance & spatial solutions in North America, Western Europe and Asia Pacific. 
Our property insights combine our patented predictive analytics and proprietary and contributed data to enable our clients to improve customer acquisition and retention, detect and prevent fraud, improve mortgage transaction cycle time and cost efficiency, identify real estate trends and neighborhood characteristics, track market performance and increase market share. Our data is comprised of real estate information with crime, site inspection, neighborhood, document images and other information from proprietary sources. We also provide verification of applicant income, identity and certain employment verification services using Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and Social Security Administration databases, as well as third-party employment data providers. Further, we maintain the leading market share of real estate listing software systems, with provisioning to more than 50% of all US and Canadian real estate agents. We also provide a full range of professional services to listing organizations and assist our clients in identifying revenue opportunities and improving member services.
Our insurance & spatial solutions provide property and casualty insurers, energy and other markets, the solutions required to more effectively locate, assess and manage property-level assets and risks through location-based data, property content, proprietary workflow solutions and analytics. In addition to the industry's first parcel-based geocoder and an industry-leading parcel database covering more than 155 million parcels across the US, we maintain critical and up-to-date information across multiple hazard databases including information on storm, land-based, fire and even non-weather-related hazards. 
Underwriting & Workflow Solutions
Our UWS segment provides comprehensive mortgage origination and monitoring solutions, including underwriting-related solutions and data-enabled valuations and appraisals. We have also developed proprietary technology and software platforms to access, automate or track this information and assist our clients with vetting and on-boarding prospects, meeting compliance regulations and understanding, diagnosing and monitoring property values. Our solutions include property tax solutions, valuation solutions, credit solutions and flood services in North America. 
Our property tax solutions are built from aggregated property tax information from over 20,000 taxing authorities. We use this information to advise mortgage originators and servicers of the property tax payment status of loans in their portfolio and to monitor that status over the life of the loans. If a mortgage lender requires tax payments to be impounded on behalf of its borrowers, we can also monitor and oversee the transfer of these funds to the taxing authorities and provide the lender with payment confirmation.
Our valuations solutions represent property valuation-related data-driven services and analytics combined with collateral valuation workflow technologies, which assist our clients in assessing risk of loss using both traditional and alternative forms of property valuation, driving process efficiencies, and ensuring compliance with lender and governmental regulations. We have been building collateral risk management models for more than 20 years and provide collateral 
 5

information technology and solutions that automate property appraisal ordering, tracking, documentation and review for lender compliance with government regulations.
Our credit solutions have access to one of the largest consumer and business databases, which enables us to provide credit and income verification services to the mortgage and automotive industries. We provide comprehensive information about credit history, income verification and home address history. We normalize our data to provide a broad range of advanced business information solutions designed to reduce risk and improve business performance.
Our flood data solutions provide flood zone determinations in accordance with the US Federal legislation passed in 1994, which requires that most mortgage lenders obtain a determination of the current flood zone status at the time each loan is originated and obtain applicable updates during the life of the loan. We provide flood zone determinations primarily to mortgage lenders.
Clients
Our clients are predominantly financial services institutions in the mortgage and insurance industries. We provide our solutions to national and regional mortgage lenders, servicers, brokers, credit unions, commercial banks, investment banks, fixed-income investors, real estate agents, MLS companies, property management companies, real estate investment trusts, property and casualty insurance companies, government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises.
Our more significant client relationships tend to be long-term in nature and we typically provide a number of different solutions to each client. Because of the depth of these relationships, we derive a significant portion of our aggregate revenue from our largest clients, with 31.3% of our 2018 operating revenues being generated by our ten largest clients. None of our clients individually accounted for greater than 10% of our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Competition
We offer a diverse array of specialized products and services that compete directly and indirectly with similar products and services offered by national and local providers. We believe there is no single competitor who offers the same combination of products and services that we do. Therefore, we believe that we compete with a broad range of entities.
Our PIRM segment competes with entities that provide access to data or data-based analytics products and services as part of their product offerings, including Black Knight, Inc., which provides real estate information, analytics, valuation-related services and other solutions, ATTOM Data, which provides public records data, FAC, which provides real estate, home ownership and property data, Verisk Analytics, Inc., which provides data and risk assessment in the insurance and financial services industries, as well as RealPage, Inc. and Yardi Systems, Inc., which provide services in the multifamily residential industry. We also compete with departments within financial institutions that utilize internal resources to provide similar analytics and services on a captive basis. We compete based on the breadth and quality of our data sets, the exclusive nature of some of our key data sets, the quality and effectiveness of our products and the integration of our platforms into client systems. We believe the data we offer is distinguished by quality, the broad range of our data sources (including non-public sources), the volume of records we maintain and our ability to provide data spanning a historical period of time that exceeds comparable data sets of most of our competitors.
Our UWS segment competes with third-party providers such as Black Knight, Inc. and Lereta LLC, which provide tax and flood services, as well as credit and screening solutions providers such as Equifax, Inc., Credit Plus, Kroll Factual Data; Clear Capital, Solidifi and ServiceLink, which provide valuation-related services. For these services, we compete largely based on the quality of the products and services we provide, our ability to provide scalable services at competitive prices and our ability to provide integrated platforms. We also compete with departments within financial institutions that utilize internal resources to provide similar services on a captive basis. We generally compete with captive providers based on the quality of our products and services, the scalability of our services, cost efficiencies and our ability to provide some level of risk mitigation.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales strategy is client-focused and resources are primarily assigned based on client size and complexity. Several of our sales team members and subject matter experts specialize in specific solutions, products and services. Each of our sales executives develops and maintains key relationships within each client’s business units and plays an important role in relationship management as well as developing new business. Our sales executives understand the current marketplace 
 6

environment and demonstrate extensive knowledge of our clients’ internal operating structure and business needs. The depth and breadth of our relationships with our clients allows us to develop and implement solutions that are tailored to the specific needs of each client in a prompt and efficient manner.
Smaller clients, measured by revenue or geographic coverage, are primarily managed through our inside sales operations function which is responsible for working with mortgage and real estate brokers, smaller property and casualty insurance companies, fixed-income investors, appraisers, real estate agents, correspondents and other lenders.
Several of our product and service lines have sales teams and subject matter experts who specialize in specific solutions, products and services. These sales teams and subject matter experts work collaboratively with our sales executives and our inside sales operations to assist with client sales by combining our data, products and data-enabled services to meet the specific needs of each client, and may be assigned to assist with sales in targeted markets, for certain categories of clients or for particular service groups.
Our marketing strategy is to accelerate growth by building trusted relationships with our clients and delivering superior value through unique property-related data, analytics and data-enabled solutions. We use the most efficient methods available to successfully identify, target, educate and engage potential and existing clients through their preferred channel of communication. Employing client-centric marketing initiatives and campaigns, we clearly articulate our value proposition to build awareness, familiarity and interest in our business solutions, demand for our products and services, and increase volume, quality and velocity of sales opportunities. Our marketing activities include direct marketing, advertising, public relations, event marketing, digital marketing, social media and other targeted activities.
 Acquisitions and Divestitures
Historically, we have increased the scale of our existing businesses and entered new markets, products and services through selective acquisitions that we believe strengthen our overall solution offerings and value proposition to clients. We continually evaluate our business mix and opportunistically seek to optimize our business portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures.
Intellectual Property
We own significant intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. We consider our intellectual property to be proprietary and we rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret and patent) and contractual safeguards in an intellectual property enforcement program to protect our intellectual property rights.
We have more than 50 issued patents in the US covering business methods, software and systems patents, principally relating to automated valuation, fraud detection, data gathering, flood detection, MLS technology and property monitoring. We also have 18 patent applications pending in these and other areas in the US. In addition, we have a number of issued patents and pending patent applications internationally, including in Canada and Australia. The protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we intend to continue to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and are material to our business.
In addition, we own more than 300 trademarks in the US and foreign countries, including the names of our products and services as well as our logos and tag lines, many of which are registered. Many of our trademarks, trade names, service marks and logos are material to our business, as they assist our clients in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them.
We own more than 1,000 registered and unregistered copyrights in the US and foreign countries, covering computer programs, reports and manuals. We also have other literary works, including marketing materials, handbooks, presentations and website content that are protected under common law copyright. We believe our written materials are essential to our business as they provide our clients with insight into various areas of the financial and real estate markets in which we operate.
Our research and development activities focus primarily on the design and development of our analytical tools, software applications, and data sets. We expect to continue our practice of investing in the development of new software applications and systems in response to the market and client needs we identify through client input collected in meetings, phone calls and web surveys. We also assess opportunities to integrate existing data sets to enhance our products' effectiveness. 
 7

In order to maintain control of our intellectual property, we enter into license agreements with our clients, granting rights to use our products and services, including our software and databases. We also audit our clients from time to time to ensure compliance with our agreements. This helps to maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions. As a general practice, employees, contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information enter into agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights, information and technology.
Information Technology
Information technology is a significant focus area and we maintain a long-term strategic technology plan which is reassessed annually. Our information technology initiatives are driven by internal technology staff with support from a number of external technology firms. Our existing technology infrastructure is a private, dedicated cloud-based computing environment hosted in a primary and secondary technology centers owned and managed by the NTT Data Corporation ("NTT").
We maintain an innovation development center ("IDC") to develop, enhance and expand our next generation cloud-agnostic IDC platform on which new products can be rapidly built, scaled, modified and deployed. In addition, the IDC plays a leading role in research and development in the areas of employing hardware advancements, data and analytics, mobility and the application of machine learning and mobility solutions. We supplement the IDC with a number of strategic alliances, including Google and Pivotal Software, Inc.
Technology Operations
Our private, dedicated cloud computing environment hosted by NTT is designed to enable us to deliver secure and compliant data, analytics and services to support client needs. This network of systems, combined with enterprise-level service operations, positions us as a leading property insights provider to the financial services market. Additionally, our platform stores, processes and delivers our data and our proprietary technologies that are the foundation of our business and critical to the development of our solutions. In conjunction with NTT, we operate a computing technology environment intended to allow us to provide flexible systems at all times, enabling us to deliver increased capacity as needed or when client needs demand increased speed of delivery. Additionally, our unified network architecture allows us to operate multiple systems as a single resource capable of delivering our applications, data and analytics as a combined solution to our clients.
Security
We have deployed a wide range of physical and digital security measures, along with a formal governance program, designed to secure our information technology infrastructure, personnel and data. Our governance program is based on corporate information security policies, an information security awareness training program along with an enterprise compliance program. Both our technology managers and NTT’s technology infrastructure managers are Information Technology Infrastructure Library certified. NTT is contractually obligated to comply with our information security policies and procedures. Our digital security framework provides layered protection designed to secure both active and inactive virtual machines in the data centers we use. This approach enables dedicated virtual machines to regularly scan all of our systems. These measures help to detect and prevent intrusions, monitor firewall integrity, inspect logs, catch and quarantine malware and prevent data breaches. Our physical and digital security solutions run in tandem, enabling us to better identify suspicious activities and implement preventive measures.
Regulation
We are subject to a number of US federal, state and local and foreign laws and regulations that involve various aspects of our businesses. Failure to satisfy those legal and regulatory requirements, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could have a significant negative impact on our ability to provide certain products and services or could result in the imposition of fines or penalties or the incurrence of damages. US federal, state and local and foreign laws and regulations are evolving and can be subject to significant change. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the US Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning consumer and data protection that could affect us. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain. These laws are enforced by regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions where we operate and, in some instances, also through private civil litigation. Among the more significant areas of regulation for our business are the following:
 8

US Consumer Financial Regulations and Data Protection
Our US operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the collection, protection and use of consumer data and other information, and provide for sanctions for the misuse of such information or unauthorized access to data. The laws and regulations that affect our US operation include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”). The FCRA governs the practices of consumer reporting agencies that are engaged in the business of collecting and analyzing certain types of information about consumers, including credit eligibility information. The FCRA also governs the submission of information to consumer reporting agencies, the access to and use of information provided by consumer reporting agencies and the ability of consumers to access and dispute information held about them. Some of our services are subject to regulation under the FCRA. Violation of the FCRA can result in civil and criminal penalties and the FCRA contains an attorney fee shifting provision to provide an incentive for consumers to bring individual or class action lawsuits for violations of the FCRA. Regulatory enforcement of the FCRA is under the purview of the US Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), and state attorneys general, acting alone or in concert with one another. Many states have also enacted laws with requirements similar to FCRA. Some of these state laws impose additional, or more stringent, requirements than FCRA.


• | Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act gave the CFPB supervisory authority over “larger participants” in the market for consumer financial services, as the CFPB defines by rule. In July 2012, the CFPB finalized its regulation regarding larger participants in the consumer reporting market. Under the regulation, certain of our credit services businesses are considered larger participants. As a result, the CFPB has the authority to conduct examinations of the covered credit services businesses and we expect that we will continue to be examined by the CFPB as part of this authority. In addition, the CFPB serves as the principal federal regulator of providers of consumer financial products and services. As such, the CFPB has significant rulemaking authority under existing federal statutes that regulate many of our products and services, as well as the authority to conduct examinations of certain providers of financial products and services, including our tax services business. The CFPB also has the authority to initiate an investigation of our other businesses if it believes that a federal consumer financial law is being violated. In addition to transferring authority under certain existing laws to the CFPB and providing it with examination and supervisory authority, the Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAP”) with respect to consumer financial products and provides the CFPB with authority to enforce those provisions. The CFPB has stated that its UDAAP authority may allow it to find statutory violations even where a specific regulation does not prohibit the relevant conduct, or prior published regulatory guidance or judicial interpretation has found the activity to be in accordance with law.


• | Privacy Laws. The privacy and protection of consumer information remains a developing area and we continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments at the federal, state and local levels. We expect that there will continue to be enhanced state and/or federal regulation in the area of financial and consumer data privacy, including regulation similar to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). As enacted, the CCPA may require us to make new disclosures to consumers about our data collection, use and sharing practices and afford consumers new abilities to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. It also provides a new cause of action for data breaches. As currently enacted, the CCPA takes effect on January 1, 2020, but is subject to further rulemaking proceedings by the California Attorney General. Any such additional regulation could significantly impact some of our business practices.

Other federal and state laws also impose requirements relating to the privacy of information held by us. For our businesses that involve the collection, processing and distribution of personal public and non-public data, certain of their solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws in the US and, to a lesser extent, foreign countries. These laws impose requirements regarding the collection, protection, use and distribution of some of the data we have, and provide for sanctions and penalties in the event of violations of these requirements. In addition, certain state laws may impose breach notice responsibilities in the event of the loss of data due to third-party security breaches, employee error, or other events resulting in persons gaining unauthorized access to our data (including, in some cases, for losses that are incurred through our clients’ errors or systems). Some of these laws require additional data protection measures over and above the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLBA") data safeguarding requirements. If data within our system is compromised by a breach, we may be subject to provisions of various state security breach laws. Most states have adopted data security breach laws that require notice be given to affected consumers in the event of a breach of personal information, and in some cases the provision of additional benefits such as free credit monitoring to affected individuals. If data 
 9

within our system is compromised by a breach, we may be subject to provisions of various state security breach laws.

• | Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The GLBA regulates the sharing of non-public personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions. In addition to regulating information sharing, the GLBA requires that non-public personal financial information be safeguarded using physical, administrative and technological means. Certain of the non-public personal information we hold is subject to protection under the GLBA.


• | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”). RESPA is enforced by the CFPB and generally prohibits the payment or receipt of fees or any other item of value for the referral of real estate-related settlement services. RESPA also prohibits fee shares or splits or unearned fees in connection with the provision of residential real estate settlement services, such as mortgage brokerage services and real estate brokerage services. Notwithstanding these prohibitions, RESPA permits payments for goods furnished or for services actually performed, so long as those payments bear a reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods or services provided. Our mortgage origination-related businesses that supply credit reports, flood and tax services, valuation products, and all other settlement services to residential mortgage lenders are structured and operated in a manner intended to comply with RESPA and related regulations.


• | Real estate appraisals and automated valuation models (“AVMs”) are subject to federal and state regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act implemented rules and guidance thereunder, and inter-agency guidance jointly issued by the federal financial institution regulators have expanded regulation of these activities. Regulations address appraisals, AVMs and other forms of property value estimates, which are subject to explicit and detailed regulations including licensing, pricing and quality control requirements. In addition, creditors are required to disclose information to applicants about the purpose, and provide consumers with a free copy, of any appraisal, AVM or other estimate of a home's value developed in connection with a residential real estate mortgage loan application.

In addition to the foregoing areas of regulation, several of our other businesses are subject to or impacted by additional regulation, including our tenant screening business, which is subject to certain landlord-tenant laws and insurance agency laws, and our activities in foreign jurisdictions are subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and comparable foreign laws.
International Consumer Financial Regulations and Data Protection
We are subject to consumer and data protection laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we conduct business. We conduct business in several international jurisdictions, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United Kingdom and various countries in Europe. Principle regulatory bodies and regulatory laws that impact our international operations include: Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, the agency with direct responsibility for administering the Australian Privacy Principles and Part IIIA of the Privacy Act 1988; the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of New Zealand, which issued the Credit Reporting Privacy Code 2004; we are subject to the European Union Data Protection Regulation, commonly known as GDPR, which prohibits the transfer of personal information from the EU to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security; and in Canada, we are subject to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act of 2000, as well as substantially similar provincial laws enacted in Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec. In addition to the above-mentioned regulations, we are subject to a variety of international consumer protection, privacy, data security and notification laws and regulations in each foreign jurisdiction in which we operate that may relate to our business or affect the demand for our products and services.
Compliance with current and future laws and regulations relating to our businesses, including consumer protection laws and regulations and international regulations, could have a material adverse effect on us and activities related to ongoing compliance will likely increase our compliance costs.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 5,800 employees, of which approximately 4,900 were employed in the US and 900 outside the US.
