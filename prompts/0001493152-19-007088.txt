Acquisition of Greenkraft, Inc.
 
On December 5, 2013, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with the sole stockholder (the “Stockholder”) of Greenkraft, Inc., a California corporation (“Greenkraft”), pursuant to which, on December 6, 2013 (the “Closing Date”), we issued 83,000,000 shares of our common stock to the Stockholder in consideration of the Stockholder’s transfer of all of his Greenkraft shares to our wholly-owned acquisition subsidiary, Greenkraft, Inc, a Nevada corporation (the “Acquisition Subsidiary)., at which time Greenkraft became Acquisition Subsidiary’s wholly owned subsidiary (the “Acquisition”).
 
Prior to the Acquisition, Greenkraft was our controlling stockholder, owning approximately 68% of our common stock which it purchased in May 2014. In addition, George Gemayel, Greenkraft’s sole shareholder, president and director, was appointed as our president and sole director in connection with their purchase of the controlling interest in May 2013.
 
As a condition to the closing of the Acquisition, on the Closing Date, 4,600,000 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock previously held by Greenkraft were cancelled pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement (the “Cancelled Shares”).
 
Following the Acquisition, we now conduct operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Greenkraft.
 
Industry Overview
 
The combination of environmental pressures, regulations, and alternative fuel vehicle initiatives has resulted in the transportation industry offering environmentally friendly, fuel-efficient vehicles. Currently automotive manufacturers are actively engaged in the competitive pursuit of innovative, clean, alternative fuel vehicles – particularly as they strive to meet new emissions rules and contribute to reducing greenhouse gases. These alternative fuel vehicles can provide needed performance, sustained mobility, and immediate emissions reductions in the industry. Compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are abundantly available in the US, and a growing network of fueling stations exists in California. Light- and medium-duty service trucks are utilized by a growing business sector. Developing these vehicles to run on CNG, LPG, and electric will offer a cleaner fuel choice for these business operators without sacrificing availability, safety, or convenience.
 
Natural gas powers about 112,000 vehicles in the United State and roughly 14.8 million vehicles worldwide. Natural gas vehicles which can run on compressed natural gas are good choices for high mileage centrally fueled fleets which operate within a limited area. For vehicles needing to travel long distances, liquefied natural gas is a good choice. CNG and LNG are considered alternative fuels under the Energy Policy Act of 1992.
 
Today’s fleets are increasingly interested in medium and heavy duty vehicles that use alternative fuels or advanced technologies that can help reduce operating costs, meet emission requirements and support US energy independence. Vehicle and engine manufacturers are responding to this interest with a wide range of options across a steadily growing number of vehicle applications.

In the absence of federal legislation, individual states have initiated and passed bills to provide incentives to encourage the use of domestic energy sources such as natural gas. Texas Senate Bills 20 and 385 have been passed and authorize funding for approximately $16 million for natural gas vehicle rebates, which includes converting heavy-duty fleet vehicles to natural gas, and $4 million per year for the next two years for the establishment of natural gas stations between the cities of Dallas, San Antonio and Houston. California, through the California Energy Commission CEC with funds through Assembly Bill 118, has established the Natural Gas Vehicle Buy-Down Program, a rebate program to incentivize the deployment of natural gas and propane vehicles in all weight classes in California.
 
Our Principal Products and Services
 
We currently offer three main products and services at this time:
 

1. | Commercial forward cabin trucks that run on alternative fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied propane gas (LPG) 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Conversion of existing vehicles to run on alternative fuels such as CNG, or LPG. 
3. | Alternative fuel engines 

Commercial Forward Cab Trucks with Alternative Fuels
 
We currently offer commercial trucks (Classes 4, 5, 6, 7) with dedicated natural gas and propane fuel system for 6.0 liter Greenkraft/General Motor (GM) engines for 14,000 lbs. and above gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) trucks and custom chassis manufacturers. We offer a range of Class 4-7 cab-forward trucks based on chassis from JAC, China’s Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Company. We then install 6.0-liter GM engines and our CNG or LPG fuel systems and for CNG we add Quantum Technologies’ tanks in the vehicle. The CNG fuel systems are assembled by Greenkraft using parts manufactured by various suppliers. The chassis and cabin are imported from overseas and the powertrain is assembled in the chassis. Prior to order of the chassis, we provided specific design specifications to JAC to ensure that the chassis comply with US guidelines and specifications. We have received California Air Resources Board (CARB) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certification of 2017 and 2018 dedicated-compressed natural gas fuel systems for its 6.0-liter GM engines for 14,000 lbs. and above GVWR trucks. We use our strategic partner, CEE, LLC for the testing of its engines prior to applying for the CARB and EPA certifications referred to above. In addition, we used CEE, LLC and G&K Automotive, another strategic partner, in connection with research and development activities. See “—Strategic Partners” below.

Customers
 
Our end users are Fleet Operators, Cities, and Businesses, and distribute through dealers.
 
Funding for the incremental cost of the vehicles was provided by the California Energy Commission (CEC) and the Mobile Source for Pollution Reduction Review Committee. The CEC provides up to (i) $20,000 per vehicle that are up to 26,000 LBS GVWR and (ii) $26,000 per vehicle that are over 26,000 LBS GVWR. These funds are paid directly to us and taken in as deposits until actual delivery of the vehicles at which time it is deemed revenue. We have received $2,024,004 million from the CEC related to the sale of CNG and propane trucks.
 
In addition, we have dealer relationships with each of (i) Superior Transportation for sales of CNG and LPG vehicles in Texas (ii) A.R. Natural Gas Fueling Systems for sales of our CNG vehicles in Pennsylvania, (iii) Demary Trucks, (iv) Taylor Trucks in Indiana, and (v) AZ commercial trucks in Arizona, We are adding new dealers in 2018. We have had discussions with other dealers throughout the United States and intend to enter into formal relationships with these dealers upon completion and assembly of additional truck inventory. There is no guarantee that we will enter into additional contracts or formal relationships with its current customers and additional dealers.
 
Convert Vehicles for Alternative Fuels
 
In addition to our offering of new commercial trucks in alternative fuels, we can convert other existing vehicles (such as vehicles manufactured by Ford or GM that do not currently run on alternative fuels) to allow engines to run on CNG or LPG instead of gas or diesel. We have converted vehicles for many dealers.
Suppliers
 
We have supplier relationships with each of Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Company (JAC Motors), General Motors and Quantum Technologies for supply of the chassis, engine and CNG tanks, respectively.
Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Company (JAC Motors)—Chassis
 
In October 2012, Greenkraft entered into an agreement with JAC Motors, a Chinese Truck Chassis Manufacturer for the supply of its chassis and cabins. Greenkraft is entitled to use the JAC brand name for manufacturing and distribution of its trucks. The Agreement is for a term of 5-years and was renewed for an additional 5-years.
 
Greenkraft has relationships with other chassis suppliers. In the event that its relationship with JAC Motors is terminated, Greenkraft is confident that it could procure a relationship with an alternative chassis supplier on commercially reasonable terms.
 
General Motors (GM)—Engines/Power Trains
 
In October 2011, Greenkraft entered into an agreement with GM under which Greenkraft will have access to GM motors and power trains for insertion into their alternative fuel trucks. The agreement is for a 3-year term and is renewable every three years. The current agreement is until December 31, 2020. Greenkraft has relationships with other suppliers of engines and power trains. In the event that Greenkraft’s agreement with GM is terminated, it is confident that it could execute agreements with other suppliers for its engines on commercially reasonable terms.
Strategic Partners
 
We have a strategic relationship with CEE, LLC, an emission laboratory of which George Gemayel is the managing member. CEE, LLC is recognized by EPA and CARB and has certified vehicles for over 30 years. Greenkraft will continue to use CEE for testing of its engines to ensure CARB and EPA compliance.
 
We also work with an automotive technical division in the automotive safety compliance industry called G&K Automotive Conversion Inc. (“G&K”). G&K is a California based company founded in 1982 to modify and certify foreign motor vehicles to meet the stringent vehicle safety and emission standards of the United States. G&K is certified as a Registered Importer (“RI”) by the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and is certified as an Independent Commercial Importer (“ICI”) by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”).

Sales Distribution Strategy
 
As discussed above, we already have distribution agreements in place with several dealers. In the event that our relationship with any dealers are terminated, we have relationships with other dealers that we can activate and believe we could enter into additional agreements on commercially reasonable terms. We intend to enter into distribution agreements with other dealers for other territories in the United States. We believe partnering with dealers for distribution of its trucks will have certain advantages such as, experienced trained sales force, service network, and existing customer base and should also serve to reduce marketing costs.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we have 6 employees and many subcontractors.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that intellectual property protection will be important to our ability to successfully compete in the alternative fuel truck industry. We currently own all rights and patents associated with the Invention “LPG Fuel System” described under Application Number 61908022. This invention relates to the conversion of vehicles to run on LPG. We are currently in the process of recording a formal notice of assignment related to this invention with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
 
We intend to rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, certifications and trade secret laws and disclosure restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights. We intend to maintain a policy requiring our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and to control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information.
 
We will enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information.
 
We will aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We will pursue the registration of our trademarks, copyrights, and domain names in the U.S. and international jurisdictions.
 
The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights. Competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technologies we employ in our services. Failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could significantly harm our competitive position and results of operations.

Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations
 
California Energy Commission (CEC)
 
The California Energy Commission was providing buy-downs related to the purchase of alternative fuel trucks to cover the incremental cost of purchasing alternative fuel vehicles. Greenkraft received $2,024,000 from the CEC of which (i) $400,000 was applied to the buy-down of 20 CNG vehicles; (ii) $340,000 was applied to the buy down of 17 CNG vehicles (iii) $400,000 was applied to the buy down of 40 propane vehicles of 14,500 lbs and $884,000 was applied to large CNG vehicles. These amounts were recognized as deferred revenue. These amounts were to be used per truck. Several incentives were received and revenues were recognized. From the amounts received $1.284 million was in the company’s books as deferred income. In 3rd quarter 2017 the company agreed to return these amounts because of the age of the incentives and apply for new ones. Therefore, the company has converted this amount from deferred income to debt and once new incentives are received the company will apply the new incentives as income per vehicle once the vehicles are sold. The Company began returning the funds to the CEC at a rate of $20,000 per month in 2017.
California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Tax Incentives
 
We intend to apply for an arrangement with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority (CAEATFA) that could result in an exemption from California state sales and use taxes for sale of our trucks.
Regulatory Credits
 
In connection with the delivery and placement into service of our alternative fuel vehicles in the United States, we may be able to earn various tradable regulatory credits that can be sold to other manufacturers.
 
Under the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) national greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards, vehicle manufacturers are required to meet fleet-wide average carbon dioxide emissions standards for cars and trucks at increasingly lower levels annually from 2012 – 2025. Those manufacturers whose fleet wide average fails to meet such standards have a deficit in their emission profile. Those manufacturers whose fleet wide average performs better than such standards may earn credits. Manufacturers may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who can apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. As a manufacturer if we earn GHG credits established by this standard we may enter into contracts for the sale of credits with several automotive manufacturers, if and when such credits are earned by us.

Regulation—EPA Emissions & Certificate of Conformity
 
Our products are sold to commercial users. Our alternative fuel engines are subject to approval for the U.S. EPA as well as state agencies such as the CARB. We have received Certificates of Conformity from the EPA and Executive Order from CARB for our natural gas and propane fuel engines that go into vehicles (in excess of 14,000 lbs.) We have received certificates for the past few years for the following engines GM 4.8 liter, 6.0 liter, 8.0 liter and Ford 6.8 liter.
 
Competition
 
Competition in the automotive industry is intense and evolving. We believe the impact of new regulatory requirements for vehicle emissions, technological advances in powertrain and shifting customer needs and expectations are causing the industry to evolve in the direction of alternative fuel vehicles. We believe the primary competitive factors in our markets include but are not limited to:

● | product quality and safety; 
--+--------------------------------
● | service options; 
● | product performance; 
● | product price; and 
● | manufacturing efficiency. 

 
The worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future.
 
Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively.
