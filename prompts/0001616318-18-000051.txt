Our Company
Vista Outdoor is a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of consumer products in the outdoor sports and recreation markets. Vista Outdoor operates in two segments, Outdoor Products and Shooting Sports. Vista Outdoor is headquartered in Farmington, Utah and has 18 manufacturing operations and facilities in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Puerto Rico along with international customer service, sales and sourcing operations in Asia, Australia, Canada, and Europe. Vista Outdoor was incorporated in Delaware in 2014. 
We serve the outdoor sports and recreation markets through a diverse portfolio of over 50 well-recognized brands that provide consumers with a wide range of performance-driven, high-quality and innovative products, including sporting ammunition and firearms, golf rangefinders, hydration products, outdoor accessories, outdoor cooking solutions, outdoor sports optics, performance eyewear, protection for certain action sports, and stand up paddle boards. We serve a broad range of end consumers, including outdoor enthusiasts, hunters and recreational shooters, athletes, as well as law enforcement and military professionals. Our products are sold through a wide variety of mass, specialty and independent retailers and distributors, such as Academy, Amazon, Bass Pro Shops/Cabela's, Big Rock Sports, Dick's Sporting Goods, Sports South, Sportsman's Warehouse, Target, United Sporting Companies, and Walmart. We also sell certain of our products directly to consumers through the relevant brand's website. 
Many of our brands have a rich, long-standing heritage, such as Federal Premium, founded in 1922, and Bushnell, founded in 1948. We believe this brand heritage supports our leading market share positions in multiple categories. For example, we believe we hold the No. 1 sales position in the U.S. markets for ammunition, binoculars, game calls, golf rangefinders, holsters, hydration packs/bottles, and trap throwing devices. To maintain the strength of our brands and drive revenue growth, we invest in product innovation to improve performance, quality, and affordability while providing world-class customer support to leading retail partners and end users. We have received numerous awards for product innovation by respected industry publications and for service from our retail customers. Additionally, high-profile professional sportsmen and athletes use and endorse our products, which influences the purchasing behavior of recreational consumers.

We have approximately 5,700 employees across four continents. We also source finished product both domestically and internationally for global distribution. Our supply chain and logistics infrastructure gives us the ability to serve a broad array of wholesale and retail customers, many of whom rely on us for services such as category management, marketing campaigns, merchandising and inventory replenishment. Our strong wholesale and retail relationships and diverse product offering provide a unique competitive advantage.
On May 1, 2018, Vista Outdoor announced its strategic business transformation plan, designed to allow the Company to focus resources on pursuing growth in its core product categories. The plan is a result of a comprehensive evaluation of the brands within our current portfolio based on their ability to serve the Company's target consumer; create cross-selling and other similar synergy opportunities; achieve market leading positions and leadership economics; and demonstrate omni-channel distribution capabilities. As a result of this evaluation, Vista Outdoor will focus on achieving growth through its market-leading brands in ammunition, hunting and shooting accessories, hydration bottles and packs, and outdoor cooking products.
The Company plans to explore strategic options for assets that fall outside of these core product categories, including its remaining Sports Protection brands (e.g. Bell, Giro, and Blackburn), Jimmy Styks paddle boards, and Savage and Stevens firearms. Vista Outdoor expects that the execution of this process will significantly reduce the Company's leverage, improve financial flexibility and the efficiency of its capital structure, and provide additional resources to reinvest in core product categories, both organically and through acquisition. We intend to begin the portfolio reshaping immediately, and anticipate executing any strategic alternatives by the end of fiscal year 2020.
Market Opportunity 
We participate in the global market for consumer goods geared toward outdoor recreation and shooting sports. Spending on outdoor recreation products in the U.S., including the purchase of gear for bicycling, camping, fishing, hunting, motorcycling, off-roading, snow sports, trail sports, water sports and wildlife viewing, totaled $93 billion in 2016, according to the 2017 Outdoor Recreation Economy National Report issued by the Outdoor Industry Association, which publishes data every five years. Examples of the sports and activities we target include archery, camping, cycling, golf, hiking, hunting, paddle boarding, snow skiing, target shooting, and wildlife watching. We believe the sporting goods and outdoor recreation sectors are lucrative global markets with the potential for future growth. We believe a greater awareness of, and participation in, outdoor sports and recreation has been a principal driver of this growth. We believe that long-term growth will be driven by positive shifts in consumer demographics utilizing our products, including increases in new, female and younger participants, and expanding interest in outdoor sports and shooting activities.

Outdoor Recreation Industry 
The outdoor recreation and accessories industry represents a large focus area of our business. Examples of activities in this industry include archery, camping, cycling, golfing, hiking, hunting, outdoor cooking, water sports, wildlife watching, and winter sports. Our consumers often participate in more than one of these activities. 
During the current fiscal year, we have seen a challenging retail environment as evidenced by recent bankruptcies and consolidation of some of our customers. This challenging retail environment has been caused by a shift in consumer preferences to online platforms, as well as other market pressures. Based on the current economic conditions and the sluggish retail environment in our market, we expect these conditions to continue into fiscal 2019. We believe that, in the long-term, the industry will continue to grow as we see increases in new, female and younger participants, and expanding interest in outdoor sports and shooting activities. We believe the fragmented nature of the outdoor recreation industry, combined with retail and consumer overlap with our existing businesses, present attractive growth opportunities. We hold a strong competitive position in the market-place, and we intend to further differentiate our brands through focused R&D and marketing investments, including increased use of social media and continuous updating of our brand websites as we strive to become our customers’ brand of choice in their respective outdoor recreation activities. Growing market share will continue to be a focus as we execute our strategy of market segmentation by brand and channel and will introduce new products to accomplish this. We are continuing to expand our e-commerce presence to capitalize on the ongoing shift by consumers to online shopping and are leveraging the experience from our recent acquisitions to drive growth across business-to-business, dot com, dropship, and direct-to-consumer channels. 
Shooting Sports Industry 
Shooting sports products currently represent approximately half of our sales. We design, develop, manufacture, and source ammunition, long guns and related equipment products. Among these categories, we derive the largest portion of our sales from ammunition, which is a consumable, repeat purchase product. During fiscal 2016 and in the first half of fiscal 2017, firearms and ammunition sales experienced an increase as more individuals entered the market and certain public and political events provided focus on the industry. During the later months of fiscal 2017 and continuing into fiscal 2018, we believe the market softened due to developments in the political environment. The shooting sports industry historically has been a cyclical business with previous market declines lasting 12–24 months. The current political climate, the timing of national elections, and other market factors may cause the current market downturn to last longer than prior cycles. We believe we are well-positioned to succeed in a difficult shooting sports market, given our scale and global operating platform, which we believe is difficult to replicate in the highly regulated and capital intensive ammunition manufacturing sector.
Competitive Strengths 
Portfolio of Authentic Brands Focused on Outdoor Recreation and Shooting Sports
We have a diverse portfolio of outdoor recreation and shooting sports brands, many with long-standing, market-leading positions. We seek to maintain our brand strength by developing performance-enhancing innovations, introducing new products, engaging in product and brand marketing campaigns, and providing marketing support to our strategic channel partners. We target selling prices that balance our premium positioning with our focus on affordability to capture a large consumer base. Our brand strength and product innovations allow us to drive sales growth and deliver robust profit margins. 
We employ a segmented brand strategy that leverages over 50 brands that are leaders in niche categories. This approach provides us with several competitive advantages:

• | Strong brand recognition, with the ability to command a leading market share position across several categories. For example:


◦ | Federal Premium ammunition brand has a No. 1 market share in ammunition,


◦ | Savage Arms is a nationally recognized long gun brand among hunters and recreational shooters who desire quality at an affordable price,


◦ | Bushnell brand has a No. 1 market share in binoculars and golf rangefinders,


◦ | CamelBak is the leading provider of hydration system solutions for individuals in the hiking, cycling, and winter sports markets,

3


◦ | Bell is a leading provider of helmets for individuals in the cycling market,


◦ | Giro is a leading provider of helmets for individuals in the cycling and winter sports markets,


◦ | BLACKHAWK! has a No. 1 market share in gun holsters, and


◦ | Hoppe's brand has a No. 1 market share in gun cleaning solutions and accessories.

• Better insight into consumer preferences and market dynamics through information sharing across our portfolio. For example, our strategic relationships with key accounts combined with our world-class customer service model deliver consumer insights into our aligned product development organization and process. This information helps us develop and maintain a robust new product pipeline. 
• Increased presence and shelf space in our core retail channels. We are able to command more shelf space by offering a wide variety of brands. 
Leading Innovation and Product Development Competencies 
We believe our product development capabilities and intellectual property portfolio provide us with a strong competitive advantage. By applying our engineering and manufacturing expertise, we have been able to bring to market new and innovative products that maintain product differentiation while targeting affordability for our end consumers. 
We have continuously invested in research and development ("R&D") and made disciplined investments in new technology to deliver sustainable growth and satisfy the evolving needs of our customers. We have leveraged our resources to help our brands develop a sophisticated R&D business process that we believe is difficult to replicate. Our current intellectual property portfolio includes approximately 700 patents, providing us with valuable proprietary trade secrets and technological know-how that we share across our platform. We employ approximately 115 dedicated design and product development professionals across the organization. 
Recent examples of our innovative, market-leading products include:

• | For the hunter, Federal Edge TLR (Terminal Long Range) produces improved long range accuracy and performance for big game hunting at long distances for best in class performance.


• | For the competition shooter, Federal Gold Medal Berger provides match grade ballistics from factory ammunition. The most sought after bullets among competitors on the Precision Rifle Series (PRS) are now loaded into the industry’s most trusted factory rifle ammunition.


• | Primos’ latest blind, Double Bull SurroundView™ 360° Blind is truly the Blind Without A Blind Spot™. It’s constructed with exclusive one-way see-through walls that let you see all of your surroundings without being seen. It includes 180° full front shooting window, 5 shoot through ports and TRUTH camo specifically designed to hide ground blinds in any terrain allowing you to spot all the movement you miss with traditional blinds, yet remain just as concealed. 


• | Bushnell Golf, the No.1 Electronic Measuring Device brand in Golf, launched the Hybrid, the world’s first laser rangefinder and GPS combo unit with a fully integrated display featuring both laser and GPS yardages. The Hybrid is packed with features including 400 yards range to flag, 5x magnification, PinSeeker with JOLT Technologies, Fast Focus system, and preloaded with 36,000+ courses in 30 countries making it the most advanced laser rangefinder/ GPS combo device in the golf market. 

Proven Manufacturing, Global Sourcing, and Distribution Platform 
We believe our state-of-the-art manufacturing expertise, leading sourcing and distribution capabilities, and high-quality retail, wholesale and distributor networks allow us to produce, deliver and replenish products in a more efficient and faster manner than our competitors. We believe this allows us to better meet the needs of our customers and end users. We operate 18 manufacturing facilities in the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Canada. A large portion of our manufacturing requires rigorous adherence to regulatory standards and certification. These regulations provide high barriers to entry as they require significant capital investments and lengthy government approval processes to manufacture many of our high-volume products. 
4

Further, we believe that we leverage the scale and scope of our manufacturing operations to be the low-cost producer of many of our products. 
Our business model incorporates strategic deployment and alignment of our key objectives and goals, which include stringent operational metrics to drive year-over-year quality improvements, on-time delivery, and operating efficiencies. We maintain a disciplined quality process and oversight to drive bottom line results and meet customer expectations. Additionally, our customer service model collects and incorporates consumer insight data, providing quality improvement opportunities. 
Integrated supply chain management is core to our company. We procure large quantities of raw materials for our manufacturing operations and we leverage negotiating disciplines and production methods, with the objective of obtaining the best price and delivery available as well as low-cost conversion of raw materials into finished product. We also source finished product both domestically and internationally for global distribution. We continuously seek to improve our vendor base as well as our in-country support and oversight, and, through our integrated supply chain management process, we seek to provide year-over-year reductions in product costs. We believe the scope and scale of our sourcing network is not easily replicated. 
We have a global presence, selling goods through our distribution network in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. We continue to leverage and enhance the scale and automation of our consolidated North American distribution centers to decrease overall distribution costs. 
We maintain positive relationships with our retail partners based on trust and professionalism. Our long-standing commitment to our customers, diverse product offering and focus on profitability for both our company and our retail partners have enabled us to gain shelf space and secure premium placement of our products at many major retailers. Our top retail and distributor partners include Academy, Amazon, Bass Pro Shops/Cabela's, Big Rock Sports, Dick's Sporting Goods, Sports South, Sportsman's Warehouse, Target, United Sporting Companies, and Walmart. For many of our top retail partners, our management team interfaces directly with their executives to ensure we are delivering the products our retailers need to meet the demands of the end user in the most efficient and profitable manner possible. Furthermore, we believe our scale is a unique competitive advantage that allows us to leverage our platform to efficiently and profitably service our largest retail customers. For example, we work with our key retail customers to develop marketing and advertising campaigns, provide inventory replenishment support, and organize product category merchandising plans. These capabilities give us an advantage as we believe few competitors offer this level of retail support or a more comprehensive product portfolio.
Our Strategy
Focus Our Resources on Core Product Categories
We aim to create sustained, profitable growth by focusing on and investing resources in our core product categories. Our core product categories are those that give us the opportunity to achieve leadership economics as a result of shared customers, costs, channels, capabilities, and competition. 
Capitalize on a Growing and Fragmented Market 
We seek to capitalize on the growing and fragmented market opportunities in the outdoor recreation and shooting sports markets. We believe our scalable business platform, strong retail and wholesale relationships and product development capabilities position us to capture additional market share. We intend to utilize our existing infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities to support the growth of our retail customers, and we will continue to leverage our economies of scale and distribution capabilities to efficiently capture the upside potential related to increases in consumer demand. 
Develop New and Innovative Products to Drive Organic Growth and Customer Loyalty 
We intend to continue to drive organic growth and customer loyalty through the development of new and innovative products. We believe our outdoor enthusiast consumers demand the latest technologies and performance enhancements, which drives new consumer purchases or replacement purchases for older products. We expect that our product development strategy will enable us to grow sales, maintain or increase profit margins and preserve the strength of our brands. 
We believe our integrated outdoor recreation and shooting sports platforms, leading brands and scale enable us to enhance the cost synergy potential and success of an acquisition by leveraging our customer relationships, sales and marketing resources, low-cost manufacturing and distribution network. We also believe our broad distribution network and retail partnerships can accelerate revenue growth in acquired companies.

Leverage Relationships with Our Wholesale and Retail Channels 
We have strong relationships with a number of leading wholesalers as well as mass and specialty retailers. We continuously strive to strengthen our relationships by working closely with each of our channel partners. This may include providing marketing support, supporting joint merchandising programs and managing inventory on our partners' behalf. We will continue to leverage these relationships to secure increased shelf space and premium product placement and to increase retailer sell-through of our products, including through expansion of our e-commerce platform. As a result, we expect to grow our market share. 
Continuously Improve Operations 
We have a strong focus on continuous improvement in all facets of our business, including engineering, product development, manufacturing, procurement, sales, distribution and administrative functions. We plan to leverage shared services and centers of excellence to drive efficiencies across business units. We use our business model, Vista Business System, to align functional execution to the goals of the enterprise and to implement these goals throughout the organization. We also use VBS to identify opportunities for process improvement and to implement and monitor quality and efficiency-focused refinements to our processes. We expect to continue to drive operational improvements in our legacy business areas, our recent acquisitions and in future acquired businesses to deliver improved competitive positions and margin improvement. 
Business Operations 
Operating Segments 
Vista Outdoor operates through two operating segments: Outdoor Products and Shooting Sports. See Note 17, Operating Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding our segments. 
Outdoor Products 
The Outdoor Products product lines are action sports, archery/hunting accessories, camping, global eyewear and sport protection products, golf, hydration products, optics, shooting accessories, tactical products and water sports.

Shooting Sports 
The Shooting Sports segment designs, develops, produces, and sources ammunition and firearms for the hunting and sport shooting enthusiast markets, as well as ammunition for local law enforcement, the U.S. government and international markets. The Shooting Sports product lines include centerfire ammunition, rimfire ammunition, shotshell ammunition, reloading components and firearms. Our Shooting Sports segment generated approximately 50% of our external sales in fiscal 2018. 
Customers and Marketing 
Our primary customers are retailers and distributors who serve outdoor enthusiasts, hunters, recreational shooters and athletes, as well as law enforcement and military professionals. Sales to our top ten retailer and distributor customers accounted for approximately 37% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2018, U.S. customers represented 67% of our sales, while international customers represented 23% and law enforcement and military professionals represented 10%. See Note 17, Operating Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our customers and geographic information regarding our sales. We believe the outdoor recreation and shooting sports industries are led by enthusiasts with a passion for reliable, high-performance products, who rely on a wide variety of media for opinions and recommendations about available products. We utilize third-party endorsements and purchased media to enhance the perception of our brands and products and to reinforce our leadership positions in the market. For example, we routinely garner coverage in leading print and digital trade and non-trade publications that include Field & Stream, Guns & Ammo and American Rifleman. We supplement this exposure with data-driven print advertising that is designed to maximize reach and return on 
6

investment. We have an industry-leading digital media presence that includes YouTube influencers and Range365, a Vista Outdoor Branded content site. Our approach is reaching the new and recreational target shooter audience while serving our core hunting audiences. Our integrated efforts include broadcast exposure on top networks and sponsorship of ratings-leading programming such as Bone Collector, Buckmasters, Guns & Ammo and Primos' Truth About Hunting. We also rely on brand ambassadors within the industry such as Michael Waddell, Jim Shockey, Rickie Fowler, and mainstream personalities such as Troy and Jacob Landry on the hit series Swamp People. 
Quality Assurance 
We maintain a disciplined quality assurance process. We set stringent metrics to drive year-over-year quality improvements. We also have a customer call center process, which allows us to collect important customer data, providing us with the opportunity to make improvements to our quality to ensure that our customers are satisfied with our customer service process. 
Employees 
We employ approximately 5,700 people. We operate 18 manufacturing facilities in the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Canada. We have union-represented employees at our Westfield, MA and Tijuana, Mexico locations, comprising approximately 5% of our total workforce. We have had no strikes or work stoppages during the last five years. We believe that our employee relations generally are good. 
Competition 
Competition in the markets in which we operate is based on a number of factors, including price, quality, product innovation, performance, reliability, styling, product features, and warranties, as well as sales and marketing programs. Significant competitors in the outdoor sporting market include Amer Sports, Johnson Outdoors, and Thule Group. Significant accessories competitors include major optics companies Nikon and Vortex and hydration system competitors including Hydro Flask, Contigo, and Nalgene. Significant ammunition competitors include Remington Arms, Winchester Ammunition of Olin Corporation, and various smaller manufacturers and importers, including Black Hills Ammunition, CBC Group, Fiocchi Ammunition, Hornady, PMC, Rio Ammunition, and Wolf. Significant firearms competitors include Marlin, Mossberg, Remington Arms, Ruger, Smith and Wesson, and Winchester. 
Seasonality 
Our business experiences a certain level of seasonality. Sales of our spring products and summer products, such as golf accessories, can be adversely impacted by unseasonably cold or wet weather in those periods. Sales of our premium hunting accessories are generally highest during the months of August through December due to shipments around the fall hunting season and holidays. Sales of sporting ammunition have historically been lower in our first fiscal quarter. Our winter sport accessories sales can be negatively impacted by unseasonably warm or dry weather in our markets. 
Intellectual Property 
In the highly competitive business in which we operate, our tradenames, service marks, and trademarks are important to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. We rely upon trade secrets, continuing technological innovations, and licensing arrangements to maintain and improve our competitive position. We also have a portfolio of approximately 700 U.S. and foreign patents, and we believe these patents, as well as unpatented research, development, and engineering skills, make important contributions to our business. We are not aware of any facts which would negatively impact our continuing use of any of our tradenames, service marks, trademarks, or patents. 
Regulatory Matters 
Like many other manufacturers and distributors of consumer products, we are required to comply with a wide variety of laws, rules, and regulations, including those surrounding labor and employment law, environmental law, consumer product safety, and the export and import of our products. These laws, rules and regulations currently impose significant compliance requirements on our business, and more restrictive laws, rules, and regulations may be adopted in the future. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable domestic and international laws and regulations. 
Our operations are subject to a variety of international, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing the discharge, treatment, storage, transportation, remediation and disposal 
7

of hazardous materials and wastes, and restoration of damages to the environment, as well as health and safety matters. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with these laws and regulations and that forward-looking, proper and cost-effective management of air, land, and water resources is vital to the long-term success of our business. Our environmental policy identifies key objectives for implementing this commitment throughout our operations. We incur operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental requirements, and could incur significant additional costs as a result of more stringent requirements that may be promulgated in the future. 
Some environmental laws, such as the U.S. federal Superfund law and similar state laws, can impose liability, without regard to fault, for the entire cost of the cleanup of contaminated sites on current or former site owners and operators or parties who sent wastes to such sites. We are conducting investigation and/or remediation activities at certain of our current or former sites where impacts from historical operations have been identified. We also have been identified as a PRP, along with other parties, in regulatory agency actions associated with hazardous waste disposal sites. While uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of the ultimate environmental liabilities at these sites, based on currently available information, we do not currently expect these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. We could incur substantial additional costs as a result of any additional obligations imposed or conditions identified at these or other sites in the future. 
As a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products, we are subject to various domestic and international consumer product safety laws, such as the Consumer Products Safety Act, which empowers the Consumer Products Safety Commission to investigate and deem certain of our products as unsafe or hazardous. Under certain circumstances, the Consumer Products Safety Commission or similar international agencies could ask a court to require us to repurchase or recall one or more of our products. In addition, laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some cities and states, as well as in other countries in which we sell our products. 
We are also subject to the rules and regulations of the ATF and various state and international agencies that control the manufacture, export, import, distribution, and sale of firearms, explosives, and ammunition. If we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, these agencies may limit our growth or business activities, or, in extreme cases, revoke our licenses to do business. Our business, as well as the business of all producers and marketers of ammunition and firearms, is also subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations and protocols. Applicable laws:
• require the licensing of all persons manufacturing, exporting, importing, or selling firearms and ammunition as a business; 
• require serialization of new firearms, labeling and tracking the acquisition and disposition of firearms, certain types of ammunition, and certain related products; 

• | require background checks for purchasers of firearms;

• impose waiting periods between the purchase of a firearm and the delivery of a firearm; 
• prohibit the sale of firearms to certain persons, such as those below a certain age and persons with criminal records; 
• regulate the use and storage of gun powder or other energetic materials; 
• regulate the interstate sale of certain firearms and ammunition; 
• prohibit the interstate mail-order sale of firearms; 
• regulate our employment of personnel with certain criminal convictions; and, 
• restrict access to firearm or ammunition manufacturing facilities for certain individuals from other countries or with criminal convictions. 
In some cases, the handling of our technical data and the international sale of our products is also regulated by the U.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce. These agencies oversee the export of our products including firearms, shotguns, ammunition, and night vision devices, amongst other products. In many instances, we must obtain export authorizations for international shipments. In addition, the ITAR requires congressional approval for any firearms export application with a total value of $1 million or higher. To date, most of our requests for export licenses have been approved. 
8

These agencies can impose civil and criminal penalties, including denying us from exporting our products, for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
We are also regulated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which handles the out-bound and in-bound movement of certain of our products, as well as components, parts, and materials used in our manufacturing processes. The agency can detain and seize shipments, as well as penalize us for failure to comply with applicable regulations. The agency also works closely with the Department of State and the Department of Commerce to ensure compliance in protection of national security.
