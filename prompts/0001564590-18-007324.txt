Strategy 
 We are focused on strategies that we believe will enhance our long-term financial health and deliver long-term shareholder value. In order to achieve these objectives, we plan to generate continued growth of our existing brands and products, as well as pursue new opportunities to develop, acquire or distribute new brands and products. 
 On June 30, 2016, Neoteric Cosmetics, Inc., (“Neoteric”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Ultimark Products, Inc. (“Ultimark”) and consummated the transaction contemplated thereby (the “Acquisition”), pursuant to which Neoteric purchased from Ultimark all intellectual property assets and certain related assets owned by Ultimark as well as inventory of finished goods owned by Ultimark and used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of the Prell®, Denorex® and Zincon® brands of hair and scalp care products (collectively, the “Brands”). The total consideration Neoteric paid for the Brands was approximately $9 million, plus the assumption by Neoteric of certain specific liabilities of Ultimark related to the performance of certain purchase orders and contracts following June 30, 2016. 
 On June 30, 2016, the Company and Neoteric, as borrowers, entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Chase”), as lender, pursuant to which Chase provided a term loan and a revolving credit facility that was used by us to finance a portion of the Acquisition and for the Company’s general corporate purposes and working capital.
 For 2018, we plan to pursue the following primary goals: (1) continue to increase sales by strengthening and broadening consumer awareness of our products; (2) continue to add additional products to the mix of products that one or more of our existing major customers already buy from us; (3) continue to obtain new distribution of our products at retailers that currently do not buy products from us; and (4) continue to evaluate potential products to be developed, acquired, manufactured and/or distributed by us.
 Household Products 
 Scott’s Liquid Gold® Wood Care has been our core product since our inception. It has been sold in the United States for over 60 years. Unlike a furniture polish, our product contains natural oils that penetrate the wood’s surface to clean, replace lost moisture, minimize the appearance of scratches and bring out the natural beauty of wood. We have also introduced an additional wood care product in a wipe form, and a floor restore product. Our Dust ’N Go pre-moistened cloth wipes are quick, easy and convenient dusting wipes for wood and numerous other surfaces, and our Scott’s Liquid Gold® Floor Restore product is a quick and easy way to renew and protect hardwood floors.
 Household products accounted for 13.4% of our consolidated net sales in 2017 and 17.0% in 2016. We continually evaluate potential new household products to be developed, acquired, manufactured and/or distributed by us. 
 Skin and Hair Care Products 
 In 1992, we began to develop, manufacture, market and sell skin care products under the trade name of Alpha Hydrox®. These products include facial care products, a body lotion, and a body wash. Our Alpha Hydrox® skin care brand was one of the first to use AHAs. Products containing AHAs gently slough off dead skin cells to promote a healthier, more youthful appearance and help to diminish fine lines and wrinkles. Starting in January 2016, we began marketing and selling our Alpha Hydrox® Skin Care line of products under the trade name of Alpha® Skin Care.  There were several reasons for the change in names, including the desire to reflect that our line of skin care products is broader than just products containing AHAs. 
 In 2016, we acquired the Prell®, Denorex® and Zincon® brands of hair and scalp care products. Prell® Shampoo, an iconic brand since 1947, is a classic clean shampoo for healthy hair. Our Denorex® products are dermatologist-recommended medicated shampoos and conditioners to control the symptoms of dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis. Our Zincon® product is a medicated anti-dandruff shampoo.
 Our Neoteric Diabetic® Healing Cream product was introduced in 2001. This product was developed to address the skin conditions of persons living with diabetes, caused by poor blood circulation. Our healing cream is a therapeutic moisturizer that provides a clinically proven and patented treatment for dry skin by helping to increase blood circulation and speed the healing of minor scrapes and cuts.

Since 2001, we have been the exclusive distributor in the United States for face and other skin care masque sachets manufactured by Montagne Jeunesse International Ltd. (“Montagne Jeunesse”). These masque sachets are currently sold under the trade name 7th Heaven. Montagne Jeunesse is based in the United Kingdom. Their sachet products are currently sold worldwide. These masques are sold for single use in unique and attractive packages in a wide assortment of types and fragrances. A significant portion of our business consists of the sale of these sachet products. See “Manufacturing and Suppliers” in this Item 1 below for information on the terms of our agreement with Montagne Jeunesse.
 We have been a distributor in the United States for Batiste Dry Shampoo since 2009. Under our distribution agreement with the manufacturer of Batiste Dry Shampoo, Church & Dwight Co. Inc. (“Church & Dwight”), we are the exclusive distributor in the United States of Batiste Dry Shampoo in the specialty retailer channel.  The specialty retailer channel includes primarily beauty supply stores, such as Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. (“Ulta”), our second largest customer, apparel retailers, and department stores. Dry shampoo is a quick and convenient way to refresh hair between washes. Batiste was one of the innovators of dry shampoo that we believe is currently one of the top selling brands of dry shampoo in the United States. See “Manufacturing and Suppliers” in this Item 1 below for information on the terms of our agreement with Church & Dwight.
 Skin and hair care products accounted for 86.6% of our consolidated net sales in 2017 and 83.0% in 2016. We continually evaluate potential new skin and hair care products as well as other beauty care products to be developed, acquired, manufactured and/or distributed by us. 
 Marketing and Distribution 
 We primarily market our products through: (1) trade promotions to support price features, displays, slotting fees and other merchandising of our products by our retail customers; (2) consumer incentives such as coupons and rebates; and (3) consumer marketing in print, social and digital media and television advertising. 
 Our products are sold nationally and internationally (primarily Canada and China), directly through our sales force and indirectly through independent brokers and manufacturer’s representatives, to mass merchandisers, drugstores, supermarkets, hardware stores, e-commerce retailers, and other retail outlets and to wholesale distributors.
 In 2017 and 2016, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”) accounted for approximately 33% and 32%, respectively, of our net sales of household products. For our skin and hair care products, Wal-Mart accounted for approximately 25% and 18% of our net sales in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Wal-Mart accounted for approximately 26% and 21% of our aggregate net sales on a consolidated basis in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2017 and 2016, Ulta accounted for approximately 25% and 29%, respectively, of our skin and hair care products and approximately 22% and 24% of our aggregate net sales on a consolidated basis in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2017 and 2016, TJ Maxx and Marshalls (collectively, “TJ Maxx”) together accounted for approximately 9% and 14%, respectively, of our skin and hair care products and approximately 8% and 12% of our aggregate net sales on a consolidated basis in 2017 and 2016, respectively. As is typical in our industry, we do not have a long-term contract with Wal-Mart, Ulta, TJ Maxx or any other retail customer.
 We also use our Scott’s Liquid Gold and Neoteric Cosmetics websites for sales of our products directly to consumers. Such sales accounted for approximately 7% and 6% of total net sales in 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 Our household and skin and hair care products are available in China, Canada, and certain other foreign countries. Currently, foreign sales are made to distributors who are responsible for the selling and marketing of the products, and we are paid for these products in United States dollars or in the case of sales to our Canadian distributor, in Canadian dollars. 
 From time to time, our customers return products to us. For our household products, we permit returns only for a limited time. With regard to our skin and hair care products, returns are more frequent under an unwritten industry standard that permits returns for a variety of reasons. In the event a skin and hair care customer requests a return of a product, we will consider the request, and may grant such request in order to maintain or enhance our relationship with the customer, even in the absence of an enforceable right of the customer to do so. Typically, customers that return products to us take a credit on our invoice equal to the original sale price plus a handling charge ranging from 8-10% of the original sales price.

Manufacturing and Suppliers 
 We owned all of our manufacturing facilities until February 1, 2013, when we sold the facilities and entered into a lease with the new owner for a portion of the facilities. Please see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information on our leasing back certain of the manufacturing facilities that we sold. We own and operate all of our manufacturing equipment. We manufacture all of our products with the exception of the following products: (1) those products for which we act as a distributor; (2) Denorex® and Zincon®, which were acquired in the Acquisition; and (3) our Scott’s Liquid Gold® Dust ’N Go wipes. We plan to start manufacturing Denorex® and Zincon® during 2018. We maintain sufficient inventories of all of our products to ship most orders as they are received.
 Quality control is enforced at all stages of production, as well as upon the receipt of raw materials from suppliers. We purchase our raw materials from a number of suppliers and, at the present time, all of our raw materials are readily available. However, we do not have long term contracts with our suppliers and any contracts we do have with suppliers may be terminated at any time. Our sole supplier for the oxygenated oil used in our Neoteric Diabetic® Healing Cream product is a French company with which we have a non-exclusive supply agreement. In addition, we have sole suppliers for two of the polymers used in our Scott’s Liquid Gold® Floor Restore product. We believe that we have good relationships with all of our suppliers. 
 Most of our manufacturing operations, including most packaging, are highly automated, and, as a result, our manufacturing operations are not labor intensive, nor, for the most part, do they involve extensive training. We currently operate on a one-shift basis. Our manufacturing facilities can produce substantially larger quantities of our products without any expansion, including the products that we acquired in the Acquisition and, for that reason, we believe that our physical plant facilities are adequate for the foreseeable future. 
 In 2001, Neoteric commenced purchases of face and other skin care sachets from Montagne Jeunesse under a distributorship agreement covering the United States. Pursuant to our distribution agreement with Montagne Jeunesse that became effective on September 15, 2014, we continue as the exclusive distributor to market and sell Montagne Jeunesse’s face and other skin care sachets in the United States. The current term of our distribution agreement with Montagne Jeunesse expires on September 15, 2019. Our distribution agreement with Montagne Jeunesse automatically renews for two year terms, unless terminated at the end of any such term upon six months prior notice. 
 Under the terms of the distribution agreement with Montagne Jeunesse, Neoteric agreed, among other things: (1) not to distribute during the duration of the distribution agreement any goods of the same description as and which compete with the Montagne Jeunesse products; (2) to use our commercially reasonable endeavors to develop, promote and sell the products in the United States and to expand the sale of the Montagne Jeunesse products to all potential purchasers by all reasonable and proper means; (3) to purchase certain core products from Montagne Jeunesse; and (4) to maintain an inventory of the Montagne Jeunesse products for our own account for sale of these products throughout the United States. Further, under the terms of our distribution agreement, Montagne Jeunesse agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to meet all of our orders for the Montagne Jeunesse products. The initial pricing terms for the products were negotiated with Montagne Jeunesse. Any changes to the prices must be mutually agreed to by both parties and must be agreed to at least six months in advance. Neoteric may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under the distribution agreement with Montagne Jeunesse or subcontract the performance of any obligation. 
 Under our distribution agreement with Church & Dwight that became effective on January 1, 2015, as amended effective July 1, 2016 and July 17, 2017, respectively, we are the exclusive distributor of Batiste Dry Shampoo products in the specialty retailer channel in the United States. The specialty retailer channel includes primarily beauty supply stores, such as Ulta, our second largest customer, apparel retailers and department stores. Church & Dwight retained the rights to sell Batiste products to the remainder of the market in the United States.
 The distribution agreement with Church & Dwight provides that we will not be permitted to manufacture, distribute or sell any products that are competitive with Batiste Dry Shampoo products. The initial pricing terms for the Batiste products were negotiated with Church & Dwight, but may be increased by Church & Dwight at any time upon 90 days’ prior written notice of any price increase. The term of the distribution agreement with Church & Dwight runs through December 31, 2018 and will automatically renew for successive one year terms until it is terminated by either party upon 30 days’ prior written notice.

Competition 
 Both the household and skin and hair care products markets are highly competitive. We compete in both markets against a range of competitors, most of which are significantly larger and have greater financial resources, name recognition and product and market diversification than us. We compete in both categories primarily on the basis of quality and the distinguishing characteristics of our products. The wood care product category is dominated by three to five companies that are significantly larger than us and each of these competitors produces several competing products. In the skin and hair care category, several of our competitors are significantly larger than us and each of these competitors produces several competing products. Some of these companies also manufacture products with AHAs with which our Alpha® Skin Care products must compete.
 Regulation 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that pertain to the types of consumer products that we manufacture and sell. Many chemicals used in consumer products, some of which are used in several of our product formulations, have come under scrutiny by various state governments and the Federal government. These chemicals are called volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”), which arguably contribute to the formation of ground level ozone. Many states as well as the Federal government have passed regulations that limit the amount of VOCs allowed in various categories of consumer products. All of our products currently meet the most stringent VOC regulations and may be sold throughout the United States. Any new or revised VOC regulations developed by various states or the Federal government may apply to our products and could potentially require reformulation of those products in the future. Limitation of VOC content in consumer products by both state and Federal governments will continue to be part of regulatory efforts to achieve compliance with clean air regulations. We continue to monitor all environmental regulatory activities and believe that we have done all that is necessary to satisfy the current requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act and the laws of various state governments.
 Our production facility is also subject to Federal, state, and local regulations governing water quality, air quality, and waste related to stationary sources. We have obtained the necessary permits from the state of Colorado, which implements the delegated Federal programs. These programs regulate the emissions, discharges, and waste generated in the production of our products.  Like the Federal standards for our products, we continue to monitor the standards and take measures to comply with them.
 Many of our skin care products, several of which contain AHAs, are considered cosmetics within the definition of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FFDCA”). The FFDCA defines cosmetics as products intended for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness or altering the appearance without affecting the body’s structure or functions. Our cosmetic products are subject to the regulations under the FFDCA and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. The relevant laws and regulations are enforced by the FDA. Such laws and regulations govern the ingredients and labeling of cosmetic products and set forth good manufacturing practices for companies to follow. Although FDA regulations require that the safety of a cosmetic ingredient be substantiated prior to marketing, there is no requirement that a company submit the results of any testing performed or any other data or information with respect to any ingredient to the FDA. As to our products containing AHAs, based on guidance and Q&A’s published by the FDA, we believe we are appropriately marketing our products as cosmetics and our labeling fully complies with the FDA’s guidance.
 Our advertising is subject to regulation under the Federal Trade Commission Act and related regulations, which prohibit false and misleading claims in advertising. We believe that all of our labeling and promotional materials comply with these regulations. 
 Employees 
 As of March 30, 2018, we employ 66 people of which 37 full-time and 1 part-time work in plant and production related functions and 28 work in administrative, sales and advertising functions. No contracts exist between us and any union. We monitor wage and salary rates in the Rocky Mountain area and pursue a policy of providing competitive compensation to our employees. The compensation of our executive officers is subject to annual review by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Additional benefits that we provide for our employees include medical, vision and dental plans, short-term disability, life insurance, a 401(k) plan with matching contributions for employees earning $50,000 or less per annum and an employee stock ownership (ESOP) plan. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
Patents and Trademarks 
 At present, we own one patent for our Neoteric Diabetic® Healing Cream. Additionally, we actively use our registered trademarks for Scott’s Liquid Gold®, Alpha® Skin Care, Prell®, Denorex®, Zincon®, and Neoteric® in the United States and have registered trademarks in a number of additional countries. Our registered trademarks protect names and logos relating to our products as well as the design of boxes for certain of our products. 
 During 2017 and 2016, our expenditures for research and development were insignificant.
