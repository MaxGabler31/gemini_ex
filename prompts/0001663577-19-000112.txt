Item 1. Business 
Company Overview

Until recently, we have been in the business of purchasing and selling colored diamonds and other valuables. We planned to manage a portfolio of rare colored diamonds that were selected for price potential.
 Since the initiation of our plan of operations, however, we have experienced losses and have been unable to obtain significant additional finances to further our colored diamond business. In order to pursue our business plan, we would need to obtain additional funding in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock or loans. Unfortunately, we have not been able to identify sources of equity financing and do not have any arrangements in place for any future financing.
 Because of the difficulties in raising additional funding, we have been presented with the difficult task of re-evaluating our business plan to determine whether it continues to be commercially viable. As a result of our lack of progress so far, the uncertainty regarding the source of our required additional funding and the relatively risky overall nature of our enterprise, management has been evaluating alternative business opportunities.
 
On November 16, 2017, we entered into an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with American Freight Xchange, Inc., a privately held New York corporation (“American Freight”), and Shipzooka Acquisition Corp. (“Shipzooka Sub”), our newly formed wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary. In connection with the closing of this merger transaction, Shipzooka Sub merged with and into American Freight (the “Merger”) on November 16, 2017, with the filing of Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State and Certificate of Merger with the New York Division of Corporations.
 
In addition, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement:
 
Each share of American Freight common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger was converted into the right to receive 73,000,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock. As a result, the shareholders of American Freight received 1,000,000 newly issued shares of our Series C Preferred Stock.
 
American Freight provided customary representations and warranties and closing conditions, including approval of the Merger by a unanimous vote of its board of directors and voting stockholders.
 
Spin-Out of Assets
 
At the same time as the Merger, we entered into an Agreement of Conveyance, Transfer and Assignment of Assets (the “Conveyance Agreement”) with our prior officer and director, Kashif Khan, along with shareholders Faeghen Niakab, and Parand Bioukzadeh and joint venture partner, Eddeb Management. Pursuant to the Conveyance Agreement, we transferred all assets and business operations associated with our colored diamond business and joint venture, Flawless Fund GP Inc., to the other parties to the agreement. In exchange, Mr. Khan, Mr. Niakab and Mr. Bioukzadeh agreed to cancel 16,000,000 shares in our company and to assume up to $100,000 in liabilities relating to our former business.
 
This transaction was fully disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 5, 2017.
 
We intend to carry on the business of American Freight, as our primary line of business. We have relocated our principal executive offices to 170 Traders Blvd East, Mississauga, Ontario L4Z 1W7, and our telephone number is 631-994-3242.
 
In the near future, we intend to change our name to American Freight Xchange, Inc. or something similar, which is more in line with our new business direction.

American Freight Xchange, Inc. is an integrated 3PO and logistics company. We are engaged in the business of the fulfillment of e-commerce transportation and logistics for third parties.
 
American Freight Xchange, Inc. manages the entire “logistics process”. Our freight management program obtains the most effective combination of rates, carriers, tracking and service points to pick up returned products from store and distribution center levels with centralized billing, auditing and claims capabilities.
 
American Freight Xchange, Inc., through our wholly owned subsidiary KRG Logistics, Inc. has the expertise to manage all the manufacturers and retailers shipping. Due to our strategic placement in the supply chain relative to the manufacturers and retailers or distributors position, we are best suited to offer these services. American Freight Xchange, Inc. customizes freight management and fulfillment programs that provide manufacturers and retailers with the most cost-effective services from the moment the shipment authorization is issued to the time the product is shipped and received.
 
Our Business
 
We are both a less-than-truckload (“LTL”) and a Third-Party Logistics (“3PL”) carrier, providing regional, inter-regional and national LTL and or 3PL services. These include arranging for ground and air expedited transportation and consumer household pickup and delivery (“P&D”), through a single integrated organization. In addition to our core LTL services, we offer a range of value-added services which cover different areas, such as, truckload brokerage, supply chain consulting and warehousing and pick and ship services.
 
We believe the growth in demand for our services can be attributed to our ability to consistently provide a superior level of customer service at a fair price, which allows our customers to meet their supply chain needs. Our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent high-quality service from origin to destination, and we believe our operating structure and proprietary information systems enable us to efficiently manage our operating costs. Our services are complemented by our technological capabilities, which we believe provide the tools to improve the efficiency of our operations while also empowering our customers to manage their individual shipping needs.
 
Subsequent Events
 
On September 4, 2018 we incorporated Cannagistics, Inc., in the province of Ontario, Canada. This is intended to be a new line of business for the Company but is dormant at this time.
Our Industry
 
Trucking companies provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the United States and Canada, and around the world. The trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers: LTL and truckload. LTL freight carriers typically pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck. The LTL freight is then routed through a network of service centers where the freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations. LTL motor carriers generally require a more expansive network of local P&D service centers, as well as larger breakbulk, or hub, facilities. In contrast, truckload carriers generally dedicate an entire truck to one customer from origin to destination. According to the American Trucking Associations, the trucking industry accounted for 79.8% of the $847.6 billion total U.S. transportation revenue in 2016. In 2016, the entire LTL sector had revenue of approximately $54.7 billion. This represented 6.5% of the total U.S. transportation revenue for the year.
 
3PL provides logistics and supply chain management for other companies. It is used to outsource elements of the company’s distribution and fulfillment services. The global 3PL market reached $750 billion in 2014 and grew to $157 billion in the US. Furthermore, demand growth for 3PL services in the US outpaced the growth of the US economy in 2014. As of 2014, 80 percent of all Fortune 500 companies and 96 of the Fortune 100 used some form of 3PL services.

Competition
 
The transportation and logistics industry overall is extremely competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with many regional, inter-regional and national LTL carriers and 3PL provider, and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers, small package carriers, airfreight carriers and railroads.
 
We utilize flexible scheduling and train our employees to perform multiple tasks, which we believe allows us to achieve greater productivity and higher levels of customer service than our competitors. We believe our focus on employee communication, continued education, development and motivation strengthens the relationships and trust among our employees.
 
Both the LTL and 3PL industry is highly competitive on the basis of service and price and has consolidated significantly since the industry was deregulated in 1980. Based on 2016 revenue as reported in Transport Topics, the largest 10 and 25 LTL motor carriers accounted for approximately 51% and 62%, respectively, of the total LTL market.
 
We believe we are able to gain market share by expanding our capacity and providing high-quality service at a fair price.


Government Regulations

We do not require any government approval in order to operate our business. In the event any of our operations or products requires government approval, we will comply with any and all local, state and federal requirements.
 Other than federal and state securities laws and common business and tax rules and regulations, we are not subject to any material government regulation. However, there is a risk that we could be adversely affected by current laws, regulations or interpretations or that more restrictive laws, regulations or interpretations will be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive. There is also a risk that a change in current laws could adversely affect our business.
 In addition, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, such regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with the then current regulatory or licensing requirements or any interpretation of such requirements by the regulatory authority. Our failure to comply with any of these requirements or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
