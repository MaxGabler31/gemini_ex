ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
Scores Holding Company, Inc. was incorporated in Utah on September 21, 1981 under the name Adonis Energy, Inc. We adopted our current name in July 2002. Since 2003, we have been in the business of licensing the “Scores” trademarks and other intellectual property to fine gentlemen’s nightclubs with adult entertainment in the United States. As of February 15, 2022 there are six such clubs operating under the Scores name, in Chicago, Illinois; Tampa, Florida; Mooresville, North Carolina; Palm Springs, Florida; Las Vegas, Nevada and Huntsville, Alabama.
 
Our trademarks and copyrights surrounding the Scores trade name are critical to the success and potential growth of our business. On December 9, 2013, the Company entered into a license agreement with its subsidiary, Scores Licensing Corp. (“SLC”), granting SLC the exclusive right to use certain trademarks, including the “Scores” stylized trademark, in connection with certain goods and services. The grant of license also includes the right to issue sublicenses to third parties, subject to the approval of the Company. Pursuant to the agreement, SLC shall pay to the Company a royalty, as determined by the Company, such as a percentage of net revenue or a flat fee, received in connection with the provision of services and/or sale of goods using the trademarks. SLC may also pay a percentage, as determined by the Company, of all royalties received by SLC under any sublicense agreements. SLC and any sublicensees are to adhere to quality standards as set by the Company, and the Company has the right to inspect all facilities and approve all promotional and marketing materials as well as any related packaging. The agreement has a one-year term with automatic one-year renewals, subject to either party’s election to terminate the agreement at least thirty days prior to such renewal. The Company also has the right to terminate the agreement, with immediate effect, upon the occurrence of certain events. The license is subject to any pre-existing license agreements as of the date of the agreement. As of the date of this report, the license is still in full force and effect.

History and Development of our Business
 
On March 31, 2003, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Master License Agreement (the “MLA”) by and between us and our former affiliate, Entertainment Management Services, Inc. (“EMS”), an entity owned by two of our former directors and employees, we granted EMS an exclusive, worldwide renewable 20-year license in our property to sublicense the Scores trade name to nightclubs (the “Licensing Rights”). Under the MLA, EMS was required to pay us 100% of the royalties EMS received from the formerly affiliated clubs (defined below) and 50% of the royalties received from non-affiliated clubs (the “Royalty Rights”). These clubs had license agreements with EMS pursuant to which they typically paid EMS approximately 4.99% of their gross revenues from operations, including the sale of merchandise. We depended on these royalties to operate our business and as our principal source of revenue.
 
On January 27, 2009 (as further discussed below under “Nightclubs Currently Licensing our Scores Brand”), we terminated the MLA with EMS and EMS transferred to us all of the Licensing Rights and Royalty Rights. Since termination of the MLA, our intellectual property is licensed through its subsidiary, SLC, to the three remaining clubs that previously had been sublicensing our intellectual property from EMS, and, thus, as of January 27, 2009, we are receiving 100% of the royalty payments made by these clubs rather than the 50% we were entitled to under the MLA.
 
Until January 27, 2009, we were under common control with two previously existing nightclubs in New York, New York (referenced herein as “Scores East” and “Scores West”) which were owned, respectively, by 333 East 60th Street, Inc. (“333”), and Go West Entertainment, Inc. (“Go West”). EMS is also owned by 333. Through EMS, we had sublicense agreements with each of Scores East and Scores West pursuant to which they were entitled to use the Scores intellectual property. Throughout this report, we refer to Scores East and Scores West as our “formerly affiliated clubs.”
 
As further discussed below under “Change in our Ownership,” on January 27, 2009, Mitchell’s East LLC, wholly owned by Robert M. Gans, acquired a majority interest in our outstanding capital stock. I.M. Operating LLC (“IMO”), which is partially owned by Robert M. Gans who is also our majority shareholder, has signed a licensing agreement with the Company and commenced operations in New York of a new club (the “New York Club”) under the Scores name in May 2009. Effective September 1, 2017, IMO no longer owned or operated the New York Club and terminated its licensing agreement with the Company. IMO sold the New York Club to Club Azure LLC (“CA”) which is owned by Mark Yackow, an unrelated party, and the sole owner (100%) of CA and former Chief Operating Officer of IMO.

Throughout this report, we refer to each of Scores New York and Scores Atlantic City (as defined below) as our “affiliated club” because of the common ownership by Mr. Gans, our Chief Executive Officer and Director. All of our clubs, with the exception of Scores New York and Scores Atlantic City (see discussion below under “Nightclubs Currently Licensing our Scores Brand”), are referred to in this report as “non-affiliated clubs” or as “licensees” (or “sublicensees,” as applicable), a term that may include the formerly affiliated clubs or the New York Club or Scores Atlantic City when the context requires.
 
Change in our Ownership
 
On January 27, 2009, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement (the “SPA”), Mitchell’s East LLC (“Buyer”), purchased an aggregate of 88,900,230 shares (the “Owned Shares”) of our common stock beneficially owned by Richard Goldring and Elliot Osher (collectively the “Share Sellers”), as well as any rights Harvey Osher (the Share Sellers and Harvey Osher, together, the “Sellers”) may have in 13,886,059 shares of our common stock (the “Decedent Owned Shares”) currently held of record by the estate of William Osher, deceased, and any rights the Sellers may have in an additional 2,400,001 shares of our common stock (the “Expectancy Shares”).  Under the terms of the SPA, Harvey Osher is to deliver to the Buyer the Decedent Owned Shares that he may receive, and the Sellers are to deliver to the Buyer any shares of the Company underlying the Expectancy Shares that any such Seller may receive.  Additionally, pursuant to the SPA, each of the Sellers granted to Buyer an irrevocable proxy enabling Buyer to act as his proxy with respect to any shares underlying the Decedent Owned Shares and the Expectancy Shares, as applicable.
 
The Owned Shares represent approximately fifty four percent (54%) of our outstanding capital stock and the Owned Shares together with the Decedent Owned Shares represent approximately sixty two percent (62%) of our outstanding capital stock.
 
As a result of the SPA, a change of control had occurred. Robert M. Gans, our Chief Executive Officer and director, is the sole owner of Mitchell’s East LLC, currently beneficially owned 53.8% shares of our common stock.
 
Changes in our Management
 
On August 6, 2010, we appointed Robert M. Gans as our President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of our Board of Directors. Robert M. Gans and Martin Gans, one of our existing Board members, are brothers. Also on August 6, 2010, we appointed Howard Rosenbluth as our Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Rosenbluth is also a director.
 
In May 2009, Stephen J. Sabbeth became our director of acquisitions and licensing. He resigned as of August 5, 2021.

Nightclubs Currently Licensing our Scores Brand
 
Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement between us and EMS dated January 27, 2009, payments due to EMS under existing licenses with non-affiliated clubs were assigned to us. Since this Assignment Agreement, we have retained 100% of the royalty payments from each of these clubs.
 
In 2003, EMS licensed the use of the “Scores Chicago” name to Stone Park Entertainment, Inc. for its club in Chicago, Illinois. The license is for a term of five years, with five successive five year renewal terms. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for information regarding our legal proceeding against this licensee.
 
On September 30, 2010, we entered into a licensing agreement with Tampa Food & Entertainment, Inc. for the use of the name “Scores Tampa.”  Upon signing the contract, we received a non-refundable fee. The license is for a term of five years, with five successive five year renewal terms. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for information regarding our legal proceeding against this licensee.
 
On February 10, 2014, we (through our subsidiary SLC) entered into a trademark license agreement with TWDDD, Inc., granting it an exclusive, non-transferable license for the use of certain Scores trademarks in its night club/restaurant in Mooresville, North Carolina. The license is for a term of five years, with five successive five year renewal terms. Pursuant to the written agreement, SLC also granted the licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to sell certain licensed products bearing our trademarks. As discussed in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements because of the tenuous nature of the gentlemen’s club industry in general and the resulting financial instability of this licensee in particular, the Company follows ASC 606 and only recognizes revenue when the collection of revenue is considered probable.
 
Effective August 31, 2015, we (through our subsidiary Scores Licensing Corp.) entered into a trademark license agreement with Palm Springs Grill LLC, granting it an exclusive, non-transferable license for the use of certain Scores trademarks in its night club/restaurant in Palm Springs, Florida. The license is for a term of five years, with five successive five year renewal terms. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for information regarding our legal proceeding against this licensee.
 
Effective December 2, 2016, we (through our subsidiary Scores Licensing Corp.) entered into a trademark license agreement with Southern Highland Centerfolds Inc. granting it an exclusive, non-transferable license for the use of certain Scores trademarks in its night club/restaurant in Las Vegas, Nevada. The license is for a term of five years, with five successive five year renewal terms.

On March 5, 2020, we (through our subsidiary SLC) entered into a trademark license agreement with Cheetah Club LLC, granting it an exclusive, non-transferable license for the use of certain Scores trademarks in its night club/restaurant in Huntsville, Alabama.. The license is for a term of five years, with five successive five year renewal terms. Pursuant to the written agreement, SLC also granted the licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to sell certain licensed products bearing our trademarks. As discussed in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements because of the tenuous nature of the gentlemen’s club industry in general and the resulting financial instability of this licensee in particular, the Company follows ASC 606 and only recognizes revenue when the collection of revenue is considered probable.
 
Recent Events
 
As a result of the COVID-19 virus, during the first quarter of 2020 and ongoing, state and local governments have required all but certain essential businesses to close, including all clubs operating under the Scores name. The duration and ultimate extent of the closures of these clubs cannot be predicted at this time, however the impact on such clubs' revenue could be material and result in a significant decline in our royalty revenues.
 
 Competition
 
The adult nightclub entertainment business is highly competitive with respect to price, service, location and professionalism of its entertainment. Sublicensed clubs will compete with many locally-owned adult nightclubs. It is our belief, however, that only a few of these nightclubs have names that enjoy recognition and status equal to the Scores brand. Other localities where our “Scores” brand is licensed have similar competitive environments.
 
We believe the combination of our name recognition and our distinctive entertainment environment allows our licensees to effectively compete within the industry, although we cannot assure anyone that this will prove to be the case. The success of our licensees depends upon their ability to retain quality entertainers, employees and to provide customer service to their customers. The inability to sustain quality entertainers, employees and customer service could have a material or adverse impact on the ability of our licensees to compete within the industry.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2019, we had two full-time employees. We have no part time employees or independent contractors.

Our employees are not represented by a labor organization or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees and to date, we have not experienced any significant labor disputes.
Intellectual Property
 
Our business is dependent on a combination of trademarks, domain names, trade names, trade secrets and other proprietary rights in order to protect our intellectual property rights. As of the date of this report, we have 15 registered trademarks in the United States.
Government Regulation
 
Our licensees are subject to a variety of governmental regulations depending upon the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate. The most significant governmental regulations are described below.
Liquor Licenses
 
Our licensees are subject to state and local licensing regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages. We expect licensees to obtain and maintain appropriate licenses allowing them to sell liquor, beer and wine. Obtaining a liquor license may be a time consuming procedure. In New York, for example, a licensee must make an application to the New York State Liquor Authority (the “NYSLA”) for a liquor license regarding its proposed nightclub. The NYSLA has the authority, in its discretion, to issue or deny such a license request. The NYSLA typically requires local community board approval in connection with such grants. Approval is usually granted or denied within 90-120 days from the initial application date, but can take longer in certain circumstances. Other jurisdictions have their own procedures.
 
We cannot offer any assurance that our licensees will obtain liquor licenses or that, once obtained, they will maintain their liquor licenses or be able to assign or transfer them if necessary. A license to sell alcoholic beverages in many cases requires annual renewal and may be revoked or suspended for cause, including any regulatory violation by the nightclub operating the license or its employees. Royalties for our business could decrease, if one or more of our licensees fails to maintain its liquor license.
 
"Cabaret" Licenses
 
Although not a requirement, our licensees typically request a cabaret license in connection with the operation of their nightclubs. Cabaret licenses are not a requirement in all states; however, some states mandate that such licenses be obtained prior to the operation of an adult nightclub. For example, one of our formerly affiliated clubs was granted a cabaret license for a nightclub by the City of New York’s Department of Consumer Affairs (the "DCA"). We believe our licensees comply with all regulatory laws regarding cabaret or an adult entertainment license; however, there is no assurance that any of their licenses will remain effective or that they could be assigned or transferred if necessary. If one or more of our licensees failed to maintain a required license, this could have a material or adverse effect on our cash flow and profitability.

Zoning Restrictions
 
Adult entertainment establishments must comply with local zoning restrictions which can be stringent. For example, zoning regulations in the City of New York mandate that an adult entertainment business operate in an area zoned as residential, or in areas that are commercially zoned, and devotes more than either 40% or more of its space available to customers or 10,000 square feet for adult entertainment activities. Although we expect our licensees to operate within "zoned" areas, we cannot make any assurances that local zoning regulations will remain constant, or that if changed, our licensees will be able to continue operations under our Scores brand name trademark. If zoning regulations were to restrict the operations of one or more of our licensees, this could have a material or adverse effect on our cash flow and profitability.
Trademarks
 
We hold trademark and/or service mark registrations in the United States. Such registrations were granted on various dates and are subject to renewal on various dates. Some of these trademarks are also registered in other jurisdictions outside of the United States. Applications have also been filed in the United States for other trademarks and/or service marks incorporating the SCORES word trademark, as well as others.
 
Our trademarks and service marks provide significant value to us and are an important factor in our business. We believe that our trademarks and service marks do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third parties.
