ITEM 1. — BUSINESS
The Company
We are a fully integrated frac sand supply and services company, offering complete mine to wellsite proppant supply and logistics solutions to our customers. We produce low-cost, high quality Northern White frac sand, which is a premium proppant used to enhance hydrocarbon recovery rates in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells. We also offer proppant logistics solutions to our customers through our in-basin transloading terminals and our SmartSystemsTM wellsite proppant storage capabilities. We market our products and services to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, oilfield service companies and industrial manufacturers, and sell our sand under a combination of long-term take-or-pay contracts and spot sales in the open market, and provide wellsite proppant storage solutions services and equipment under flexible contract terms custom tailored to meet customers’ needs. We believe that, among other things, the size and favorable geologic characteristics of our sand reserves, the strategic location and logistical advantages of our facilities, our proprietary SmartDepotTM portable wellsite proppant storage silos, SmartPathTM transloader and the industry experience of our senior management team make us as a highly attractive provider of frac sand and proppant logistics services from the mine to the wellsite. 
We own and operate a frac sand mine and related processing facility near Oakdale, Wisconsin, at which we have approximately 250 million tons of proven and probable recoverable sand reserves as of December 31, 2021. We incorporated in Delaware in July 2011 and began operations with 1.1 million tons of annual nameplate processing capacity in July 2012. After several expansions, our current annual processing capacity at our Oakdale facility is approximately 5.5 million tons of frac sand. Our integrated Oakdale facility, with on-site rail infrastructure and wet and dry sand processing facilities, has access to two Class I rail lines and enables us to process and cost-effectively deliver products to our customers. 
In September 2020, we acquired from Eagle Materials Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Eagle”), all of the issued and outstanding interests in Eagle Oil and Gas Proppants Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Eagle (“Eagle Proppants Holdings”). The primary assets of Eagle Proppants Holdings and its subsidiaries include two frac sand mines and related processing facilities. The Utica, Illinois mine has approximately 129 million tons of proven and probable recoverable reserves as of December 31, 2021, annual processing capacity of 1.6 million tons and access to the BNSF Class I rail line through the Peru, Illinois transload facility. We began operating the Utica, Illinois mine and Peru, Illinois transload facility in October 2020. The secondary asset acquired in the acquisition was the New Auburn, Wisconsin mine, which we are not currently using to produce sand. The acquisition also included rights to use a rail terminal located in El Reno, Oklahoma, which was idled at the time of the acquisition but has recently started operating again.
We operate a unit train capable transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota to service the Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin. We operate this terminal under a long-term agreement with Canadian Pacific Railway to service the Van Hook terminal directly along with the other key oil and natural gas exploration and production basins of North America.  The Van Hook terminal became operational in April 2018. Since operations commenced, we have been providing Northern White sand in-basin at this terminal to our contracted and spot sales customers. This terminal allows us to offer more efficient delivery options to customers operating in the Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin.
In September 2021, we acquired the rights to construct and operate another transloading terminal in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania to service the Appalachian Basin, including the Marcellus and Utica Formations. The Waynesburg terminal became operational in January 2022. We believe the Waynesburg terminal will allow us to be one of the most efficient and low-cost sources of frac sand in the Appalachian Basin. 
We also offer to our customers portable wellsite proppant storage and management solutions through our SmartSystems products and services. Our SmartSystems provide our customers with the capability to unload, store and deliver proppant at the wellsite, as well as the ability to rapidly set up, takedown and transport the entire system. This capability creates efficiencies, flexibility, enhanced safety and reliability for customers. We believe that our SmartSystems reduce trucking and related fuel consumption for our customers, helping them meet their goals to reduce their carbon footprint in their daily operations. 
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we generated net (loss) income of approximately $(50.7) million, $38.0 million and $31.6 million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $(30.5) million, $20.5 million and $87.1 million, respectively. For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, please read “Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  
Acquisition subsequent to the year-ended December 31, 2021
On March 4, 2022, we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Hi-Crush Inc., a Delaware corporation (“HCR”), and Hi-Crush Blair LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of HCR (“Blair”), pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Blair from HCR for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $6.5 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments as set forth in the Purchase Agreement (the “Transaction”). Entities affiliated with Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. (“Clearlake”), who collectively own approximately 24% of the Company’s outstanding common stock, also own a significant portion of the outstanding common stock of HCR, and representatives of Clearlake serve on our board of directors and HCR’s board of directors.
The primary assets of Blair consist of an idle frac sand mine and related processing facility located in Blair, Wisconsin. The Blair facility has approximately 2.8 million tons of total annual processing capacity and contains an onsite, unit train capable rail terminal with access to the Class 1 Canadian National Railway. 
We believe this acquisition broadens our mine to wellsite capabilities by adding high quality sand mining and processing assets coupled with enhanced logistics options that provide direct access to an additional Class I rail line. We believe these additional mining and logistics resources help secure our ability to be a leading provider of Northern White Sand in the proppants market. With this acquisition, we now have direct access to four Class I rail lines and the ability to access all Class 1 rail lines within the United States and Canada.
Market
In recent years, the increasing supply of sand, particularly in-basin sand, relative to demand, has led to a continued depression of frac sand prices. Demand was strong in the first half of 2019 before declining toward the end of 2019 as oil and gas companies exhausted their budgets and managed their capital spending to be in line with their expected operating cash flows. During most of 2020, demand for frac sand declined significantly as a result of reduced oil and natural gas drilling and completion activity due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a global decrease in all means of travel, the closure of borders between countries and a general slowing of economic activity worldwide. Activity in the oil and gas industry began to rebound in the fourth quarter of 2020 and throughout the year ended 2021 as the global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines ramped up and travel restrictions lessened. We have seen an increase in the volume of sand sold as the global economy has begun to reopen. However, the prices for frac sand remained depressed in 2021 due to overbuilt capacity relative to current demand. Increased supply of sand coupled with volatility in oil demand resulted in lower prices for our products and led to reduced interest in long-term contracts as customers have instead trended toward purchasing their frac sand supply in the spot market at current market prices. However, we expect that the recent higher demand for frac sand could lead to better pricing opportunities, although we cannot predict when frac sand prices will increase or stabilize, if at all.
Northern White frac sand, which is found predominantly in Wisconsin and limited portions of Minnesota, Illinois, and Missouri, is considered a premium proppant due to its favorable physical characteristics. While we anticipate that regional sand will continue to affect the demand for Northern White sand in some of the oil and natural gas producing basins in which we operate, we believe there will continue to be demand for our high-quality Northern White frac sand. In particular, we believe that Northern White frac sand has logistical advantages in the Marcellus, Bakken, and western basins of Colorado and Wyoming. We expect demand for our frac sand to continue to be supported by customers who are focused on long-term well performance and ultimate recovery of reserves from the oil and natural gas wells they are completing as well as those interested in the efficiency of their logistics supply chain and delivery of sand to the wellsite. Additionally, we believe market trends continue to support increased proppant usage per well drilled due to operator focus on well efficiencies through increasing lengths of drilling laterals, use of simul-fracking techniques and other well enhancement strategies. Finally, we believe that the adoption of our SmartSystems provide improved efficiencies in shipping and storing sand at the wellsite through reduced trucking requirements, which removes traffic from the roads, lowers diesel fuel consumption, thereby providing incremental value to our customers by reducing their carbon emissions and meeting their ESG initiatives. 
In late 2021, we expanded our product offering to provide Industrial Product Solutions (“IPS”) for our customers. We expect to expand and diversify to serve the vital industrial markets throughout North America, including glass, foundry, building products, filtration, geothermal, renewables, ceramics, turf & landscape, retail, recreation and more.
Business Strategies
Our principal business objective is to be the premier provider of sustainable Northern White Sand supply and logistics solutions to our customers. We do this through supporting our existing customers, expanding our market share, being a low-cost 
producer of high-quality Northern White Sand, maintaining low debt leverage and managing efficient and sustainable supply chain logistics from the mine to the wellsite. In late 2021, we began expanding our product line to offer IPS. We believe that by executing these business strategies, we will be able to increase long-term stockholder value. We expect to achieve this objective through the following business strategies:
•Diversifying our customer base to include Industrial Product Solutions. In late 2021, we expanded our product offering to provide IPS for industrial customers. We are in the early stages of the sales process for industrial sand and expect to expand and diversify to serve the vital industrial markets throughout North America, including glass, foundry, building products, filtration, geothermal, renewables, ceramics, turf & landscape, retail, recreation and more. 
•Expanding and optimizing our existing logistics infrastructure and developing additional origination and destination points. We expect to continue to capitalize on our Oakdale facility’s ability to ship on two Class I rail carriers to maximize our product shipment rates, increase our railcar utilization and lower our transportation costs. We have the ability to simultaneously accommodate multiple unit trains on-site with the Canadian Pacific rail network while also having the ability to ship our frac sand directly to our customers on a second Class I rail carrier through our transloading facility located on the Union Pacific rail network approximately three miles from our Oakdale facility. This access to two Class I rail carriers from Oakdale provides increased delivery options for our customers, greater competition between our rail carriers and potentially lower freight costs. 
Our second mine at Utica, Illinois and related transloading terminal in Peru, Illinois added new origination and destination points to our existing capabilities and offers additional capability to ship products on a third Class I rail carrier, the BNSF.
On March 4, 2022, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with HCR to purchase their idled Blair frac sand mine and related processing facility located in Blair, Wisconsin, which contains an onsite, unit train capable rail terminal with access to the Class 1 Canadian National Railway. With this acquisition, we now have direct access to four Class I rail lines and the ability to access all Class 1 rail lines within the United States and Canada.
We operate a multi-unit train capable transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota, which we believe allows us to be one of the most efficient and low-cost sources of frac sand in the Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin. 
In September 2021, we acquired the rights to construct and operate another transloading terminal in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania to service the Appalachian Basin, including the Marcellus and Utica Formations. The Waynesburg terminal became operational in January 2022. We believe the Waynesburg terminal will allow us to be one of the most efficient and low-cost sources of frac sand in the Appalachian Basin. 
Additionally, our SmartSystem wellsite storage and proppant management systems allows us to offer expanded logistics services to our customers. We believe that our SmartSystems reduce trucking and related fuel consumption for our customers, helping them meet their goals to reduce their carbon footprint in their daily operations. 
The benefits of our long-term growth strategy for in-basin delivery of sand include expanding our customer base by marketing through our own terminals, more opportunity for spot sales by forward deploying sand and the opportunity to capture incremental margin on the sale of sand farther down the supply chain by managing the cost of rail, terminal and wellsite storage operations. Additionally, having a presence in-basin gives us an opportunity to have a base of operations from which to market and support our SmartSystems wellsite proppant storage solutions. Through the expansion of our SmartSystems fleet and addition of new origination and destination options, we continue evaluating ways to reduce the landed cost of our products in-basin and to the wellsite for our customers while increasing our customized service offerings to provide our customers with additional delivery and pricing alternatives.
•Focusing on organic growth by increasing the utilization of our mine and frac sand processing facilities. We intend to continue pursuing opportunities to maximize the value and the utilization of our Oakdale and Utica facilities through the addition of new customers and increased sales volumes. Despite the emergence of regional sand in oil and natural gas producing basins, we believe the proppant market continues to offer attractive long-term growth fundamentals for Northern White frac sand in the key operating basins we currently serve due to the logistics advantages in these basins and its superior well results compared to regional sand alternatives. We believe that coupling our premium proppant with long-term sustainable logistics supply services may mitigate the potential cost savings of using regional sand.
Demand for frac sand increased during 2021, from the all-time lows in 2020, following the decline in demand for oil driven primarily by reduced demand from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, frac sand prices have continued to be depressed due to overbuilt capacity relative to current demand. According to Spears and Associates, Inc. (“Spears”), North America proppant demand increased by 26% in 2021 compared to 2020, mirroring an improving hydraulic fracturing market. Oil and gas prices are currently expected to stay at elevated levels in 2022, relative to historical prices, which should translate into higher drilling and completions activity. These improved market fundamentals should lead to improved proppant demand over the course of 2022.
•Focusing on being a low-cost provider and continuing to make process improvements. We continue to focus on being a low-cost provider, which we believe will allow us to compete effectively for sales of frac sand and to achieve attractive operating margins. Our low-cost structure results from a number of key attributes, including, among others, our (i) relatively low royalty rates, (ii) majority of fine mineral reserve deposits, (iii) our facilities access to all Class I rail lines within the United States and Canada creates competition between railroads and other sand logistics infrastructure advantages, and (iv) our low levels of debt. We have strategically designed our operations to provide for low-cost production, including having dryers and wet plants enclosed in our Oakdale and Utica processing facilities that allow for year-round operation at both facilities. This allows us to more efficiently match our wet sand production with our drying capacity and to better utilize our workforce with a goal to reduce the overall cost of production. We continue to invest in capital projects and consider strategic acquisitions that increase efficiencies and offer the opportunity for a high return on investment. In addition, we seek to maximize our mining yields on an ongoing basis by targeting sales volumes that more closely match our reserve gradation in order to minimize waste in our processing. We also continue to evaluate other mining techniques to reduce the overall cost of our mining operations.
•Creating flexible sales activities. We believe that demand for our products will remain strong in basins where regional sand is not an attractive alternative due to the logistics and performance advantages of Northern White Sand, such as the Bakken in North Dakota, the Marcellus and Utica formations in the Northeast region of the United States and the Colorado and Wyoming basins. We continue to have discussions with operators in these regions regarding new relationship and growth opportunities. We also believe that the long-term benefits of high quality Northern White sand outweighs the short-term cost savings provided by regional sand in the Permian, Eagle Ford and SCOOP/STACK basins. We believe there are additional opportunities for customers in the Permian and other basins, which have regional supply, who are focused on the long-term performance of their production and on the long-term efficiency of their logistics. 
While we continue to look for long-term contract opportunities, we intend to increase focus on shorter term contracts and increase sales in the spot market given the reluctance of our customers to enter into long-term take-or-pay contracts in the current market environment. Having a greater portion of our activity on spot or short-term contracts allows us the opportunity to take advantage of pricing improvements quickly should market fundamentals improve.
Competitive Strengths
We believe that we will be able to successfully execute our business strategies because of the following competitive strengths:
•Long-lived, strategically located, high-quality reserve base. We believe our three frac sand mines in Oakdale, Wisconsin, Utica, Illinois and Blair, Wisconsin have a uniquely desirable combination of a large high-quality reserves of fine mesh sand that is contiguous to their production with either on-site or close proximity to primary rail loading facilities. As of December 31, 2021, we have an estimated life of mine of approximately 90 years at Oakdale and 161 years at Utica based on our current expected sales volumes. The Blair facility, which is currently idled, increased our total annual processing capacity to approximately 10.0 million tons. 
We believe our reserve base positions us well to take advantage of current market trends of increasing demand for finer mesh frac sand. We also believe that having our mine, processing facilities and primary rail loading facilities in close proximity provides us with an overall low-cost structure, which enables us to compete effectively for sales of Northern White frac sand and to achieve attractive operating margins. 
•Intrinsic logistics advantage. We believe that we are one of the few frac sand producers with a facility custom-designed for the specific purpose of delivering frac sand to all of the major U.S. oil and natural gas producing basins by an on-site rail facility that can simultaneously accommodate multiple unit trains. Our on-site transportation assets 
at Oakdale include approximately nine miles of rail track in a triple-loop configuration and four railcar loading facilities that are connected to a Class I rail line owned by Canadian Pacific. We believe our customized on-site logistical configuration yields lower operating and transportation costs compared to manifest train or single-unit train facilities as a result of our higher railcar utilization, more efficient use of locomotive power and more predictable movement of product between mine and destination. In addition, we have a transload facility on a Class I rail line owned by Union Pacific in Byron Township, Wisconsin, approximately three miles from the Oakdale facility. This transload facility, which is also capable of handling multiple unit trains simultaneously, allows us to ship sand directly from Oakdale to our customers on more than one Class I rail carrier. We believe that we are the only sand facility in Wisconsin that has dual-served rail capabilities, which should create competition between our rail carriers and allow us to provide more competitive logistics options for our customers. 
Our Utica mine and related Peru transloading terminal in Illinois adds significant quality reserves and logistics assets that further increase our logistics advantage by providing access to another Class I rail line through our owned, multiple unit train capable Peru transload facility with direct access to the BNSF rail line. These additional logistics options give us greater access to operating basins in the Western United States allowing us to offer more competitive pricing to existing and new customers in these markets.
The addition of the Blair frac sand mine and related processing facility located in Blair, Wisconsin, which contains an onsite, unit train capable rail terminal with access to the Class 1 Canadian National Railway, has secured our access to provide sand on all Class I rail lines in the United States and Canada. 
•Expanded logistics solutions. Our transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota is capable of handling multiple unit trains simultaneously, and we have been providing in-basin sand at this terminal to our customers since operations began in 2018. This terminal has allowed us to expand our customer base and to offer more efficient delivery options to customers operating in the Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin. 
In 2021, we acquired the rights to construct and operate another transloading terminal in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania to service the Appalachian Basin, including the Marcellus and Utica Formations. The Waynesburg terminal became operational in January 2022. We believe Waynesburg terminal will allow us to be one of the most efficient and low-cost sources of frac sand in the Appalachian Basin. 
We also have rights to operate a terminal located in El Reno, Oklahoma, which we acquired through the acquisition with Eagle. While this terminal was idled at the time of the acquisition, we have been selling sand in recent months to customers located in the area. 
Our SmartSystems wellsite proppant storage and management products provide our customers with the capability to unload, store and deliver proppant at the wellsite, as well as the ability to rapidly set up, takedown and transport the entire system. This capability creates efficiencies, flexibility, enhanced safety and reliability for customers. Through our SmartSystems wellsite proppant storage solutions we offer the SmartDepot and SmartDepotXL silo systems, SmartPath transloader, and our rapid deployment trailers. We believe that our SmartSystems reduce trucking and related fuel consumption for our customers, helping them meet their goals to reduce their carbon footprint in their daily operations. We have also developed a proprietary software program, the SmartSystem Tracker, which allows our SmartSystems customers to monitor silo-specific information, including location, proppant type and proppant inventory. 
We are capable of delivering sand to any onshore operating basin in the United States and Canada. We have direct access to four Class I rail lines in North America and access to all Class I rail lines, which gives us superior advantage over many of our competitors by allowing us to offer more competitive pricing and delivery options to our customers. 
•Sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to support our operations and pursue our growth initiatives. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash on hand of $25.6 million. Further, we have a $20 million senior secured asset-based lending credit facility with Jefferies Finance LLC, under which we had undrawn availability of $14.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and no outstanding borrowings. The available borrowing amount under the ABL Credit Facility is based on the Company’s eligible accounts receivable and inventory. The ABL Credit Facility matures on December 13, 2024. Our total available liquidity among cash and available borrowings was $40.5 million as of December 31, 2021.
•Experienced management team. The members of our senior management team bring significant experience to the market environment in which we operate. Their expertise covers a range of disciplines, including industry-specific operating and technical knowledge and experience managing businesses in a variety of operating conditions.
•Focus on safety and environmental stewardship. We are committed to maintaining a culture that prioritizes safety, the environment and our relationship with the communities in which we operate, actions we believe are critical to the success of our business. We are a Tier 1 participant in The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources’ Green Tier program, which encourages, recognizes and rewards companies for voluntarily exceeding environmental, health and safety legal requirements. Since 2016, Smart Sand has maintained International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 registrations for our quality management system and environmental management system programs, respectively, for our Oakdale facility. We also have attained Green Professional status in Wisconsin’s Green Master sustainability recognition program. We are one of a select group of companies who are members of the Wisconsin Industrial Sand Association, which promotes safe and environmentally responsible sand mining standards.
Our Customers
Our core customers are oil and natural gas exploration and production and oilfield service companies. In late 2021, we began diversifying our sand sales to include IPS to customers. Sales of IPS to customers were immaterial during 2021, but we intend to increase our focus on IPS throughout 2022. We sell frac sand under long-term take-or-pay contracts as well as in the spot market, and provide proppant logistics solutions through our in-basin transloading terminals and SmartSystems wellsite proppant storage solutions and other logistics services. 
Generally, customers under long-term take-or-pay contracts are required to take minimum volumes of sand or make shortfall payments for a specified period of time. We recognize revenue in our results of operations in the period in which the obligation becomes due. 
In the current market, customers are disinclined to enter into long-term contracts for their frac sand supply and have instead trended toward purchasing their frac sand supply in the spot market or under short-term contractual arrangements at market prices. Should our customer base continue to limit their exposure to longer term contracts, we will continue to focus on shorter term contracts and increasing sales in the spot market.
Customers renting SmartSystems are able to tailor the contract, including adjusting the number of SmartDepot silos and SmartPath transloaders to be supplied, to meet their short-term and long-term needs. We recognize rental revenue when the equipment is made available for the customer to use or other obligations in the contract are met. 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, EQT, Halliburton and Liberty accounted for 24.3%, 18.3%, and 14.8%, respectively, of total revenue, and the remainder of our revenues were from 20 customers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Rice Energy (a subsidiary of EQT Corporation), Liberty and U.S. Well Services accounted for 28.1%, 21.7%, and 14.0%, respectively, of our total revenues, and the remainder of our revenues were from 20 customers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Liberty, Rice Energy (a subsidiary of EQT Corporation), Hess Corporation, and U.S. Well Services accounted for 23.8%, 19.0%, 14.7%, and 15.5%, respectively, of our total revenues, and the remainder of our revenues were from 20 customers. Please read “Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in Our Business—A substantial majority of our revenues have been generated under contracts with a limited number of customers, and the loss of, material nonpayment or nonperformance by or significant reduction in purchases by any of them could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.” 
Capital Plans
We expect 2022 capital expenditures to be between $25.0 million and $30.0 million, consisting primarily of capital for efficiency projects at Oakdale and Utica, capital related to the Waynesburg terminal and acquisition and incremental capital to purchase the Blair mine and processing facility, acquired on March 4, 2022, and to bring it online over the course of the year. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with existing cash, cash generated from operations, or borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility or other financing sources, such as equipment finance providers. 
Industry Trends Impacting Our Business
Unless otherwise indicated, the information set forth under this section, including all statistical data and related forecasts, is derived from Spears’ “Proppant Market Report with Frac Market Overview - Q4 2021” published in the first quarter of 2022. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the proppant industry data presented herein, estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors.”
Demand Trends 
According to Spears, the North American proppant market, including frac sand, ceramic and resin-coated proppant, was approximately 73 million tons in 2021, which is approximately 26% increase from the 58 million tons Spears reported for 2020. Spears estimates that 2022 demand will increase to approximately 90 million tons, which is an approximate 23% increase over 2021.
Supply Trends
There has been consolidation activity including mergers, acquisitions, closures of mines and bankruptcy filings among our peers. Additional consolidation activity is expected in 2022 in the mining, transloading and logistics businesses. 
Supplies of high-quality Northern White frac sand are limited to select areas, predominantly in western Wisconsin and limited areas of Minnesota and Illinois. We believe the ability to obtain large contiguous reserves in these areas is a key constraint and can be an important supply consideration when assessing the economic viability of a potential frac sand facility. Further constraining the supply and throughput of Northern White frac sand is that not all of the large reserve mines have on-site excavation, processing or logistics capabilities, which impact the long-term competitiveness of these mines due to lower efficiency and higher cost structures. Historically, much of the capital investment in Northern White frac sand mines was used for the development of coarser deposits in western Wisconsin, which is inconsistent with the increasing demand for finer mesh frac sand in recent years. As such, we’ve seen competitors in the Northern White frac sand market reduce their capacity by shuttering or idling operations as the shift to finer sands in hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells and to lower cost regional sand sources has eroded the ongoing economic viability of mines with coarser reserve deposits and inefficient mining and logistics facilities. 
Environmental, Social & Governance
In 2020, we refined our scope of setting a Company objective of adopting a formal Environmental, Social & Governance (“ESG”) program. Smart Sand already has a strong record of environmental performance. In 2014, we joined the Wisconsin Green Tier program, a marquee public/private partnership, under which the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources worked with us on a plan to meet applicable legal requirements and to improve our facility from an environmental perspective. In addition to documenting seven years of compliant operations, we have worked on, among other things, protecting wetlands, reducing usage and impact of heavy equipment, reducing fuel usage of equipment and vehicles and defining best practices for onsite water management. We are also a member of Wisconsin’s sustainability initiative, Green Masters. As part of this program, we have completed a detailed survey of our sustainability and social responsibility activities and started the process of a complete carbon inventory. As a mining company, we invest and plan for reclamation, ensuring that the land is returned to beneficial use. Smart Sand has held ISO 9001/14001-2015 environmental and quality management systems for the past five years. Smart Sand is also a member of the Wisconsin Industrial Sand Association, a select group of mining companies focused on safety, environmental and public policy. 
One of the goals of the United Nations’ Paris Agreement is a carbon neutral world by the year 2050. We believe that reducing our carbon footprint will lead to a better world. As a mining company, we are an energy consumer, and we have already seen that we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using the best technologies and taking a thoughtful approach to our energy choices. We know that energy consumption is only one part of ethical operations. For additional information regarding the United Nations’ Paris Agreement, see “Item 1A Risk Factors-Risks Related to Environmental, Mining and Other Regulation-Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased compliance costs for us and our customers.”
We provide social value through our excellent employment opportunities. Our first priority is keeping our employees safe, which we accomplish through daily training and inspections. Our business supports hundreds of families and we are proud to offer rewarding and interesting work with competitive compensation and benefits. We promote from within, provide continuous training, hire with a passion for diversity and provide every employee with the opportunity to participate in retirement plans and ownership of the Company. Smart Sand is an active charitable partner in the communities in which it operates, making both financial and time investments in those communities. 
Sustainability has always been part of the Smart Sand story, but we are looking forward to evaluating what we have done and identifying improvement opportunities. We are embracing this growing movement and designing an area in our website to articulate our ESG goals and report on our performance. 
Permits
We operate in a highly regulated environment overseen by many governmental regulatory and enforcement bodies at the local, state and federal levels. To conduct our operations, we are required to have obtained permits and approvals that address environmental, land use and safety issues at our operating facilities. Our current and planned areas for excavation at our mining facilities are permitted for extraction of our proven reserves. Portions of our facilities lie in areas designated as wetlands, which will require additional local, state and federal permits prior to mining and reclaiming those areas.
We also must meet requirements for certain international standards concerning safety, greenhouse gases and rail operations. We have voluntarily agreed to meet the standards of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources’ Green Tier program, the National Industrial Sand Association (“NISA”) and the Wisconsin Industrial Sand Association. Further, for Oakdale, we have agreed to meet the standards required to maintain our ISO 9001-2015 and ISO 14001-2015 quality/environmental management system registrations. These voluntary requirements are tracked and managed along with our permits.
While resources invested in securing permits are significant, this cost has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We cannot ensure that existing environmental laws and regulations will not be reinterpreted or revised or that new environmental laws and regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional environmental requirements that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Competition
The proppant industry is highly competitive. Please read “Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in Our Business—We face significant competition that may cause us to lose market share.” There are numerous large and small producers in all sand producing regions of North America with whom we compete, many of which also offer solutions for unloading, storing and delivering proppant to the wellsite. Our main competitors include Badger Mining Corporation, Hi-Crush, Inc., Covia Holdings Corporation, U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc., Capital Sand Company and Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure, Inc.
Although some of our competitors may have greater financial or natural resources than we do, we believe that we are well-positioned competitively due to our low cost of sand production, low debt levels, logistics infrastructure and high-quality, balanced reserve profile and patented SmartSystems wellsite proppant storage solutions, which offer numerous benefits over our competition. The most important factors on which we compete are our service capabilities, product quality, proven performance, sand characteristics, transportation capabilities, reliability of supply, price, logistics services and the performance of patented SmartSystems wellsite proppant storage solutions technology. Demand for frac sand and logistics solutions and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our products, to the extent not subject to a fixed price or take-or-pay contract, are closely linked to proppant consumption patterns for the completion of oil and natural gas wells in North America. These consumption patterns are influenced by numerous factors, including, among other things, the price for oil and natural gas and hydraulic fracturing activity, including the number of stages completed and the amount of proppant used per stage. Further, these consumption patterns are also influenced by the location, quality, price and availability of frac sand and other types of proppants such as resin-coated sand and ceramic proppant. 
Seasonality
Our business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations in weather that impact the production levels for a portion of our wet sand processing capacity. While our dry plants are able to process finished product volumes evenly throughout the year, our excavation and our wet sand processing activities have historically been limited to primarily non-winter months. As a consequence, we have experienced lower cash operating costs in the first and fourth quarter of each calendar year, and higher cash operating costs in the second and third quarter of each calendar year when we overproduced wet sand to meet demand in the winter months.  These higher cash operating costs are capitalized into inventory and expensed when these tons are sold, which can lead to us having higher overall costs in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year as we expense inventory costs that were previously capitalized. However, we have enclosed, indoor wet plants at our Oakdale and Utica processing facilities, which allow us to produce wet sand inventory year-round to support a large portion of our dry sand processing capacity, which may reduce certain of the effects of this seasonality. We may also sell frac sand for use in oil and natural gas producing basins where severe weather conditions may curtail drilling activities and, as a result, our sales volumes to those areas may be reduced during such severe weather periods. For a discussion of the impact of weather on our operations, please read “Risk Factors—Seasonal and severe weather conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition” and “Risk Factors—Our cash flow fluctuates on a seasonal basis.”
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property primarily consists of trade secrets, know-how and trademarks. We own patents and have patent applications pending related to our SmartSystems wellsite proppant storage solutions. All of the issued patents have an expiration date after July 2030. With respect to our other products, we principally rely on trade secrets, rather than patents, to protect our proprietary processes, methods, documentation and other technologies, as well as certain other business information. For a discussion of the impact of our intellectual property, please read “Risk Factors–If we are unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights, we may suffer a loss in our competitive advantage” and “Risk Factors–We may be adversely affected by disputes regarding intellectual property rights of third parties.”
Insurance
We believe that our insurance coverage is customary for the industry in which we operate and adequate for our business. As is customary in the proppant industry, we review our safety equipment and procedures and carry insurance against most, but not all, risks of our business. Losses and liabilities not covered by insurance would increase our costs. To address the hazards inherent in our business, we maintain insurance coverage that includes physical damage coverage, third-party general liability insurance, employer’s liability, business interruption, environmental and pollution and other coverage, although coverage for environmental and pollution-related losses is subject to significant limitations. For additional discussion regarding our insurance, please read “Risk Factors–Our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured.”
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
We are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, local and international laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of worker health, safety and the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. Private parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. In addition, the trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, these laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly pollution control equipment, the occurrence of delays in the permitting or performance of projects, or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.
We do not believe that compliance by us with federal, state, local or international environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows. We cannot be 
assured, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions adverse to our operations will not cause us to incur significant costs. The following is a discussion of material environmental and worker health and safety laws, as amended from time to time that relate to our operations or those of our customers that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Air Emissions
Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and related state and local laws, which restrict the emission of air pollutants and impose permitting, monitoring and reporting requirements on various sources. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or to address other air emissions-related issues. Changing and increasingly stringent requirements, future non-compliance, or failure to maintain necessary permits or other authorizations could require us to incur substantial costs or suspend or terminate our operations.
Climate Change
In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHG”). We are unable to predict actions that may be taken by the Federal government however, a number of states are addressing GHG emissions, primarily through the development of emission inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control GHG emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations. Independent of Congress, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has adopted regulations controlling GHG emissions under its existing authority. Compliance with new legislation may require us to incur substantial costs or suspend or terminate our operations.
President Biden and the Democratic Party, which now controls Congress, have identified climate change as a priority, and it is likely that new executive orders, regulatory action, and/or legislation targeting GHG emissions, or prohibiting, delaying or restricting oil and gas development activities in certain areas, will be proposed and/or promulgated during the Biden Administration. For example, the acting Secretary of the Department of the Interior recently issued an order preventing staff from producing any new federal fossil fuel leases or permits without sign-off from a top political appointee, and President Biden recently announced a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of Federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. President Biden’s order also established climate change as a primary foreign policy and national security consideration, affirms that achieving net-zero GHG emissions by or before midcentury is a critical priority, affirms the Biden Administration’s desire to establish the United States as a leader in addressing climate change, generally further integrates climate change and environmental justice considerations into government agencies’ decision-making, and eliminates fossil fuel subsidies, among other measures. President Biden also announced that the United States is taking steps to reenter the Paris Agreement. 
Water Discharges
The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into state waters or waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by the Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) pursuant to an appropriately issued permit. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Compliance with new rules and legislation could require us to face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for expansion activities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
Hydraulic Fracturing
We supply frac sand to hydraulic fracturing operators in the oil and natural gas industry. Hydraulic fracturing is an industry practice that is used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas from low permeability hydrocarbon bearing subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, proppants, and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock, increase permeability and stimulate production. Although we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, our customers purchase our frac sand for use in their hydraulic fracturing activities. 
The adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal or state levels imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting or delaying, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells, increase our 
customers’ costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our frac sand. 
Non-Hazardous and Hazardous Wastes
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws control the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. These laws and regulations govern the generation, storage, treatment, transfer and disposal of wastes that we generate. In the course of our operations, we generate waste that are regulated as non-hazardous wastes and hazardous wastes, obligating us to comply with applicable standards relating to the management and disposal of such wastes. In addition, drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our customers’ costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes and a corresponding decrease in their drilling operations, which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Site Remediation
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”) and comparable state laws impose strict, joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner and operator of a disposal site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of remediating the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. We have not received notification that we may be potentially responsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA at any site.
Endangered Species
The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may result in a “take” of endangered or threatened species and provides for substantial penalties in cases where listed species are taken by being harmed. Harm under the ESA includes acts that actually kill or injure wildlife as well as significant habitat modification or degradation that significantly impairs essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding or sheltering. Take prohibitions also protect migratory birds under the MBTA. 
The dunes sagebrush lizard is one example of a species that, if listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA, could impact our operations and the operations of our customers. The dunes sagebrush lizard is found in the active and semi-stable shinnery oak dunes of southeastern New Mexico and adjacent portions of Texas, including areas where our customers operate and our frac sand facilities may be located. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) is currently reviewing a petition from the Center for Biological Diversity and the Defenders of Wildlife to list the dunes sagebrush lizard as endangered or threatened under the ESA, and on July 16, 2020, issued a 90-day finding that the petition presents substantial information that listing may be warranted and the agency will conduct a more thorough review to determine whether listing may be warranted. On November 17, 2021, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a 60-day notice of intent to sue the U.S. Department of the Interior and USFWS for unlawfully delaying protection of the dunes sagebrush lizard under the ESA; as of March 4, 2022, no suit has been filed. If the dunes sagebrush lizard is listed as an endangered or threatened species, our operations and the operations of our customers in any area that is designated as the dunes sagebrush lizard’s habitat may be limited, delayed or, in some circumstances, prohibited, and our and our customers could be required to comply with expensive conservation measures intended to protect the dunes sagebrush lizard and its habitat.
The USFWS has approved several Enhancement of Survival Permits that allow operations in designated habitats to continue if the dunes sagebrush lizard is listed provided that qualification criteria and conservation measures required by such permits are met. One such permit is referred to as the Texas Conservation Plan (“TCP”). The TCP was developed as a voluntary conservation plan for the dunes sagebrush lizard by the Texas Comptroller, which served as the permit holder until the transfer of the TCP to a new permit holder in September 2020. Smart Sand is a participant in the TCP and has enrolled 2,713-acres of its land in Winkler, County, Texas. The USFWS issued a second Enhancement of Survival Permit for operations in West Texas that may affect the dunes sagebrush lizard in January 2021. The permits cover incidental “take” of the dunes sagebrush lizard associated with oil and gas exploration and development, sand mining, renewable energy development and operations, pipeline construction and operations, local government activities, agricultural activities, and general construction 
activities within the CCAA permit area that could affect suitable habitat. Smart Sand’s enrollment in the TCP minimizes the potential that new or more stringent conservation measures or land, water, or resource use restrictions beyond the measures and restrictions in the TCP may be required for that property. 
To the extent species are listed under the ESA or similar state laws, or are protected under the MBTA, or previously unprotected species are designated as threatened or endangered in areas where we or our customers operate, we could experience increased costs arising from species protection measures and delays or limitations in our or our customers’ performance of operations, which could adversely affect or reduce demand for our frac sand.
Mining and Workplace Safety
Our sand mining operations are subject to mining safety regulation. The U.S. Mining Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) is the primary regulatory organization governing frac sand mining and processing. Accordingly, MSHA regulates quarries, surface mines, underground mines and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with and located at quarries and mines. The mission of MSHA is to administer the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and to enforce compliance with mandatory miner safety and health standards. As part of MSHA’s oversight, representatives perform at least two unannounced inspections annually for each above-ground facility.
OSHA has promulgated new rules for workplace exposure to respirable silica for several other industries. Respirable silica is a known health hazard for workers exposed over long periods. MSHA is expected to adopt similar rules as part of its “Long Term Items” for rulemaking, and in August 2019 published a formal request for information and data on feasible, best practices to protect miners' health from exposure to silica in respirable dust. Airborne respirable silica is associated with work areas at our site and is monitored closely through routine testing and MSHA inspection. If the workplace exposure limit is lowered significantly, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for equipment to reduce this exposure. Smart Sand also adheres to the NISA’s respiratory protection program, and ensures that workers are provided with fitted respirators and ongoing radiological monitoring.
Environmental Reviews
Our operations may be subject to broad environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended, (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all “major federal actions” significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The granting of a federal permit for a major development project, such as a mining operation, may be considered a “major federal action” that requires review under NEPA. As part of this evaluation, the federal agency considers a broad array of environmental impacts, including, among other things, impacts on air quality, water quality, wildlife (including threatened and endangered species), historic and archeological resources, geology, socioeconomics, and aesthetics. NEPA also requires the consideration of alternatives to the project. The NEPA review process, especially the preparation of a full environmental impact statement, can be time consuming and expensive. The purpose of the NEPA review process is to inform federal agencies’ decision-making on whether federal approval should be granted for a project and to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of a proposed project. Though NEPA requires only that an environmental evaluation be conducted and does not mandate a particular result, a federal agency could decide to deny a permit or impose certain conditions on its approval, based on its environmental review under NEPA, or a third party could challenge the adequacy of a NEPA review and thereby delay the issuance of a federal permit or approval. In January 2020, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would revise NEPA’s implementing regulations, with the stated purpose of facilitating more efficient and timely NEPA reviews. CEQ is currently soliciting public comments on its proposal through March 10, 2020. At this time we cannot predict what revisions, if any, will be made to NEPA’s implementing regulations, and what impacts, if any, they will have on our operations.
State and Local Regulation
We are subject to a variety of state and local environmental review and permitting requirements. Some states, including Wisconsin where our current projects are located, have state laws similar to NEPA; thus, our development of a new site or the expansion of an existing site may be subject to comprehensive state environmental reviews even if it is not subject to NEPA. In some cases, the state environmental review may be more stringent than the federal review. Our operations may require state-law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project’s impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations, and scenic areas. Wisconsin has specific permitting and review processes for commercial silica mining operations, and state agencies may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. The development of new sites and our existing operations also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building, and transportation requirements.
Demand for frac sand in the oil and natural gas industry drove a significant increase in the production of frac sand. As a result, some local communities expressed concern regarding silica sand mining operations. These concerns have generally included exposure to ambient silica sand dust, truck traffic, water usage and blasting. In response, certain state and local communities have developed or are in the process of developing regulations or zoning restrictions intended to minimize dust from becoming airborne, control the flow of truck traffic, significantly curtail the amount of practicable area for mining activities, provide compensation to local residents for potential impacts of mining activities and, in some cases, ban issuance of new permits for mining activities. To date, we have not experienced any material impact to our existing mining operations or planned capacity expansions as a result of these types of concerns. We would expect this trend to continue as oil and natural gas production increases.
In August 2014, we were accepted as a Tier 1 participant in Wisconsin’s voluntary Green Tier program, which encourages, recognizes and rewards companies for voluntarily exceeding environmental, health and safety legal requirements. Successful Tier 1 participants are required to demonstrate a strong record of environmental compliance, develop and implement an environmental management system meeting certain criteria, conduct and submit annual performance reviews to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, promptly correct any findings of non-compliance discovered during these annual performance reviews, and make certain commitments regarding future environmental program improvements. Our most recent annual report required under the Tier 1 protocol was submitted to the Green Tier Program contact on August 1, 2019.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 239 people, of which 43 were employed under collective bargaining agreements. We offer competitive salaries and a comprehensive package of employee benefits, including bonuses, retirement savings plans, medical, dental, life and disability coverage. We consider our employee relations to be good.
