Item 1. Business.
Overview
 We are a technology company offering large-scale COVID-19 testing services, molecular diagnostic testing services and comprehensive genetic testing designed to provide physicians and patients with clinically actionable diagnostic information to improve the quality of patient care. A cornerstone of our business is our ability to provide expansive options and flexibility for all clients’ unique testing needs. To this end, we have developed a proprietary technology platform allowing us to offer a broad and flexible test menu and to continually expand and improve our proprietary genetic variant reference library, while maintaining accessible pricing, high accuracy and competitive turnaround times. Combining next generation sequencing, or NGS, with our technology platform, we perform full-gene sequencing with deletion/duplication analysis in single-gene tests; pre-established, multi-gene, disease-specific panels; and customized panels that can be tailored to meet specific customer needs. We have experienced rapid volume growth since our commercial launch in 2013, with approximately 10.0 million billable tests delivered in 2021, compared to 4.4 million billable tests delivered in 2020, and an aggregate of approximately 14.5 million billable tests delivered to over 1,800 customers from inception through December 31, 2021.
Mission
 Our mission is to offer and develop flexible and affordable genetic testing services designed to improve patient care and quality of life. Founded in 2011, Fulgent began with two simple ideas; flexibility and affordability. Today, we strive to provide the most effective and wide-ranging genetic testing menu on the market. 
Our Genetic Tests, Molecular Diagnostics and COVID-19 Tests
 
Our Genetic Tests
 Our offerings consist of a wide variety of tests and test types, and our customers have a high degree of choice when selecting a test from our menu. A patient or provider may select a single-gene test of any of the genes in our portfolio or they may select one of our pre-established panel tests, which are designed to test particular genes and mutations within these genes that relate to a wide range of specified conditions and diseases. For example, our Focus and Comprehensive oncology panels test 30 genes and 127 genes, respectively, that relate to various cancers and our Beacon carrier screening panels test up to 436 genes covering over 400 inherited conditions. We can perform full-gene sequencing with deletion/duplication analysis in all of these tests. In addition, we continually seek to expand our test menu with new genes and panel tests. Our test offerings also include Solid Tumor Molecular Profiling for somatic cancer testing, Rapid Whole Genome testing developed for children in neonatal intensive care units, or NICU, or pediatric intensive care units, or PICU, our Newborn Genetic Analysis panel, and a single front-line test designed to comprehensively detect ataxia-related variants and repeat expansions via sequencing. In 2019, we launched Picture Genetics, a patient-initiated genetic testing offering aimed at individual consumers and which we advertise directly to consumers through a variety of methods including social media and other digital avenues.
 We also offer certain research service tests, which we refer to as “sequencing as a service” and which are primarily ordered by research institutions and other similar institutional customers. In addition, we offer whole exome and clinical exome panel tests, which test all genes included in our portfolio and up to 20,096 genes located in the exome, respectively, and produce results that we combine with the individual’s unique clinical presentation and family history to enhance the clinical relevance of the results. Our whole exome and clinical exome tests also include the option for Trio testing, which involves sequencing the genes of a patient’s parents and is thought to enhance the utility of the test results. In addition, we offer whole genome testing, which determines and tests the complete DNA sequence of a genome at a single time. We also provide known mutation testing, which can be used to target familial specific or other desired mutations, as well as repeat expansion testing, which tests for a particular type of mutation known as “copy choice” DNA replication.

Importantly, all of our pre-established panels are customizable, offering providers and patients the ability to add or remove genes at their election. To further increase test option flexibility, as well as to reduce the complexity of ordering tests, we consistently strive to innovate our pricing structure and features for our available tests. We have upgraded many of our pre-set panels with additional genes. In addition, if a variant is reported in a proband for whom duo or trio testing was not originally ordered, the ordering physician is given the option of adding complementary familial known mutation testing, or FKMT, for any variant reported by Fulgent in the proband’s final report, for up to two first-degree relatives. We believe these options represent competitive pricing features that will streamline the test ordering process, give customers more flexibility with added value, and reduce barriers to trio and familial testing, which can both increase the clinical utility of genetic testing for a single proband.
 We believe widespread genetic testing could enable significant health improvements and healthcare cost reductions by providing patients and clinicians with more advanced knowledge and options for personal health management plans. This expansion of testing availability and accessibility, as well as a growing and aging population; increasing overall incidence of disease; innovations in genomic medicine that enable the selection and implementation of drug treatment programs based on genetic information, or pharmacogenomics; and other factors contributed to the growth in the global market for genetic testing in recent years. If this growth trend continues, we believe genetic testing will become part of standard medical care and the knowledge of a person’s unique genetic makeup could play a more important role in the practice of medicine.
 Our COVID-19 Testing Services
 Since March 2020, we have also offered several tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the novel coronavirus disease, or COVID-19, including NGS and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-based tests, or RT-PCR-based tests. We have received an Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, that authorizes the use of our RT-PCR-based tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using upper respiratory specimens (nasal, nasopharyngeal, and oropharyngeal swabs) and in conjunction with at-home specimen collection kits that are offered as a service through Picture Genetics. Our at-home testing service for COVID-19 and RT-PCR-based test are authorized for emergency use by the FDA only for the detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2, not for any other viruses or pathogens. We are currently accepting patient samples directly to our Biosafety Level 2, or BSL-2, certified laboratories where we have the capacity to accept and process thousands of samples per day with a typical turn-around time of 24-48 hours from the time a sample is received and accepted. To date, we have processed orders for our COVID-19 tests from a variety of customers, including governmental bodies, payors, municipalities, and large corporations. In 2020 and 2021, we established and operated COVID-19 testing sites for certain municipalities. We also offer at-home COVID-19 testing services through our Picture Genetics platform.
Currently available diagnostic tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 are based on a variety of technologies and formats, including conventional antigen-based tests for detecting viral proteins and nucleic acid amplification tests which include RT-PCR-based tests. While antigen-based diagnostic tests are relatively inexpensive and can be used at the point of care, antigen-based diagnostic tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 have been observed to be less sensitive than genetic and RT-PCR-based tests. U.S. Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, guidelines indicate that the “gold standard” for clinical diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 is nucleic acid amplification which includes RT-PCR-based tests. We believe our ability to provide COVID-19 NGS and RT-PCR-based diagnostic testing services with expedited turn-around times makes us competitive in this new market.
 Our Molecular Diagnostic Testing Services
 In August 2021, we acquired Cytometry Specialists, Inc., or CSI, to expand our presence and capabilities in somatic molecular diagnostics and cancer testing. We plan to leverage our established technology platform, NGS expertise, lab operations, and sales infrastructure in conjunction with CSI’s extensive cancer testing menu to establish a differentiated foothold in oncologic testing in the United States. Through our acquisition of CSI, we have added the following types of testing services to our test menu: 

• | Flow Cytometry – a sophisticated cell analysis technique providing diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of malignancies with a relatively small sample size. It provides the ability to identify emerging abnormalities and perform rare event analysis of patient-specific aberrant immunophenotypes, or cells expressing abnormal proteins unique to a specific patient.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization, or FISH – a laboratory technique for detecting and locating a specific DNA sequence on a chromosome, FISH probe panels and individual probes are able to precisely isolate and identify genetic alterations in solid tumor and hematological neoplasms, or abnormal cells located in the blood and blood forming tissues, such as bone marrow and lymphatic tissue. FISH cancer testing is a diagnostic tool that can detect and confirm chromosome abnormalities such as deletions, duplications, translocations and other numerical or structural aberrations to diagnose and help predict the best therapeutic approach for cancer patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Immunohistochemistry, or IHC – an imaging technique used to visualize antigens in cells. IHC antibodies and histochemical stains are used to detect the presence, relative quantity, and localization of specific proteins to aid in determining differentiation in abnormal cells with similar structures. In addition to other applications, IHC is used to provide prognostic or therapeutic information.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Cytogenetics – analyzes the entire chromosome set for numerical and structural abnormalities such as chromosome additions, deletions and translocations. Identification of each abnormality may aid diagnosis and treatment decisions for cancer patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Molecular Testing – includes both hematopoietic and solid tumor molecular assays for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Advanced single gene testing, targeted profile molecular assays, and broad-spectrum tumor testing yield clinically actionable data for precise diagnosis and appropriate therapy selection.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Offerings in 2021
 New test offerings in 2021 included a COVID-19 Neutralizing antibody test, a Respiratory Pathogen Panel, that detects viral and bacterial infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts, including COVID-19, HelioLiver, a revolutionary multi-analyte blood test for early liver cancer detection, and PD Aware, a Picture Genetics product that provides easy at-home sampling to assess genetic risk for Parkinson's disease.
Our Technology Platform 
 Our tests and testing services are provided using our integrated technology platform featuring the following proprietary tools and processes: 
 Proprietary Gene Probes
 We have developed technologies to design and formulate our own proprietary gene probes, which, when combined with our proprietary genetic reference library of genetic variants and publicly available genetic databases, support our ability to sequence DNA regions we believe laboratories using commercial probes cannot sequence and improve the detection rate of our test data. In turn, we believe this enables us to produce clinically actionable results physicians can use to improve care for their patients. In addition, our proprietary gene probes are specifically engineered to generate genetic data optimized for our software, which enables us to rapidly incorporate new genes into our test menu, develop new panels of disease-specific tests and customize tests for our customers. Moreover, once we develop a probe for a new gene, we can efficiently reproduce, validate and assure the quality of that probe under applicable guidelines and standards, which allows us to continuously and rapidly expand our library of genetic content while increasing the breadth of our test menu. Additionally, we believe our probes more effectively enrich the targeted genes to improve the quality of the sequenced data we produce.
Advanced Database Algorithms
 After DNA is sequenced using all appropriate equipment and tools, the fully sequenced genes are analyzed in a process known as curation, in which every DNA sequence is aligned with a known reference sequence and differences between the DNA sequence and the reference sequence are identified. These differences, which represent potential genomic alterations, are then compared to publicly available genetic databases and proprietary genetic libraries to identify pathogenic alterations associated with disease or disease risk. We have developed proprietary data comparison and data suppression algorithms to improve and simplify this curation process by highlighting identified pathogenic mutations. Our advanced data comparison algorithms measure DNA sequences from patient specimens against genetic data available from the broader scientific community and our own proprietary reference library of genetic variant information, which enables us to rapidly and effectively detect pathogenic mutations. Our advanced data suppression algorithms reduce irrelevant noise in the genetic data we analyze, which improves the efficiency and speed of our data analysis and reduces the reliance upon manual review and comparison in the curation process.
Adaptive Learning Software
 We have developed software that automatically incorporates a variant database from certain of our non-COVID genetic tests into our expansive genetic reference library of genetic variants, enabling it to continuously evolve with each set of genes we analyze. This adaptive learning software supports the continuous improvement of our proprietary gene probes and leverages the capabilities of these gene probes to improve the speed and effectiveness of curation and reporting. Our adaptive learning software also communicates with our integrated laboratory systems, which leads to increased automation processes and other operating efficiencies.
Proprietary Laboratory Information Management Systems
 We have developed proprietary laboratory information management systems that are highly integrated with our laboratory processes and adaptive learning software. These systems provide the backbone by which we efficiently manage workflow, monitor quality and ensure the fidelity of information generation and analytics for reporting to our customers. The result is a highly connected platform that allows us to process tests and information in an efficient manner. Our talented team of software engineers continuously iterates with our laboratory and customer-facing personnel to improve the efficiencies of these systems.

Our Customers
 Historically, we primarily sold our tests to hospitals and medical institutions. We have approached the genetic testing market with a focus on these customers in part because they are frequent and high-volume users of genetic tests. We believe this customer base provides a meaningful opportunity for further growth by acquiring additional hospital and medical institution customers and by deepening our relationships with existing customers to drive increased ordering. Additionally, collection of billings from these institutional customers is generally more attainable than from other types of customers in today’s reimbursement environment. In addition, we believe hospitals and medical institutions are early adopters of NGS technology and could influence broader clinical acceptance of genetic testing. Beginning in March 2020, we also began processing orders for our COVID-19 tests from a variety of customers, including governmental bodies, municipalities, and large corporations. Since inception, we have sold our tests to over 1,800 total customers. We consider each single billing and paying unit to be an individual customer, even though a unit may represent multiple physicians and healthcare providers ordering tests. Aggregating customers that are under common control, one of our customers, the County of Los Angeles, contributed 26% of our total revenue in 2021, and two of our customers contributed 28% and 10% of our total revenue in 2020, respectively.
 We currently classify our customers by their payor types: (i) Insurance, including claims covered by the Health Resources & Services Administration, or HRSA, COVID-19 Uninsured Program for uninsured individuals, (ii) Institutional, including hospitals, medical institutions, other laboratories, governmental bodies, payors, municipalities and large corporations or (iii) Patients who pay directly. Typically, we bill our Institutional customers for our tests and they are responsible for paying us directly and billing their patients separately or obtaining reimbursement from third-party payors. In some cases, Institutional customers receive a per-visit or per-admission payment that includes our testing, which means that separate reimbursement is not available. A small percentage of our customers are patients, who elect to pay for tests themselves with out-of-pocket payments after their physicians have ordered our tests.
 Third-party payors, which consist of private health insurers and government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, require us to identify the test for which we are seeking reimbursement using the Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code set maintained by the American Medical Association, or AMA. Where we offer a multi-gene panel, and there is no CPT code for the full panel, but the panel includes a gene for which the AMA has an established CPT code, we identify the test provided under that CPT code when billing a third-party payor for that test. In cases where there is not a specific CPT code, our test may be billed under a miscellaneous code for an unlisted molecular pathology procedure. Because this miscellaneous code does not describe a specific service, the insurance claim must be examined to determine what service was provided, whether the service was appropriate and medically necessary, and whether payment should be rendered, which may require a letter of medical necessity from the ordering physician. Given the changing CPT coding environment and our development of relationships with third-party payors, we expect that our practices regarding billing these payors will evolve in the future. 
 We are making efforts to diversify our customer market, including building relationships with research institutions and other similar institutional customers, national clinical laboratories, governmental bodies, municipalities and large corporations in need of regular COVID-19 testing for large populations and various other organizations to facilitate access to physicians, practitioners and other new customer groups, including certain U.S. government agencies. We are also pursuing relationships with third-party payors, some state Medicaid programs and commercial insurers, in an effort to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our genetic tests to make them accessible to more individual physicians.

Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales and marketing force currently consists of two internal teams of sales and marketing professionals, respectively, with deep experience in our industry, as well as a network of independent sales representatives who are knowledgeable about our tests. Historically, we have significantly relied on organic growth and word-of-mouth among to generate interest in our tests, which we believe demonstrates the value of our offering. In recent years, we have invested significant time and capital to strengthen our sales and marketing efforts, including increasing the size and restructuring the organization of our internal team, re-focusing our initiatives and strategies, and increasing the overall scope of our marketing activities.
This strategy is designed to expand our brand awareness, grow our customer base and further penetrate existing relationships. We aim to achieve these objectives by providing education about the benefits and full scale of our offerings, both to the medical community in general and to our targeted markets. We plan to expand our presence and test volume in international markets through our own direct sales team, which includes sales people dedicated to international markets, a number of independent contractor sales representatives, and, if and as opportunities arise, by engaging distributors or establishing other types of arrangements, such as joint ventures, to manage or assist with sales, logistics, education and customer support in certain territories. 
 Our marketing activities also include targeted initiatives, including working with medical professional societies to promote awareness of the benefits of our tests and genetic testing in general; presenting at medical, scientific or industry exhibitions and conferences, such as Late-Breaking Positive Performance Data of HelioLiver™ for Early Liver Cancer Detection Data from the ENCORE study that was presented at The Liver Meeting® 2021, hosted by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases; and pursuing or supporting scientific studies of our tests and publication of results in medical or scientific journals. In addition, we conduct email advertising campaigns and social media awareness campaigns to existing and potential future customers when we want to send a specific message about our company and our brand, including, for instance, when we launch new tests or new test options and when we add new genes to our test menu. In addition, we launched more tests including PD Aware that determines genetic risk for Parkinson’s and Pharmacogenetics testing, the use of genetic data to guide drug therapy decisions, or PGx testing, through our Picture Genetics platform, a patient-initiated genetic testing offering aimed at individual consumers and which we advertise directly to consumers through a variety of methods including social media and other digital avenues.
 Our sales and marketing strategy is also focused on offering differentiated and highly available customer service resources, which we believe is an important factor in maintaining and deepening our customer relationships. Genetic tests are highly complex by nature and we recognize that our customers may want to discuss with us available testing options, specimen collection requirements, expected turnaround times, the cost of our tests and the clinical reports we produce. As a result, we offer comprehensive customer service designed to enable efficient ordering and increase the accessibility of our clinical reports, including customer access to our licensed and qualified laboratory directors who review and approve each report we produce. 
 Our sales and marketing team also explores strategic collaboration opportunities with various research and medical institutions. New partnerships formed in 2021 include partnering with governmental bodies, municipalities, and large corporations for providing COVID-19 services to citizens, employees, and students.
 Our Suppliers
 We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain laboratory substances used in the chemical reactions incorporated into our processes, which we refer to as reagents, as well as for the sequencers, collection kits, and various other equipment and materials we use in our laboratory operations. In particular, we rely on Illumina, Inc. as the sole supplier of the next generation sequencers and associated reagents we use to perform our genetic tests and as the sole provider of maintenance and repair services for these sequencers. In addition, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for COVID-19 test collection kits. Our laboratory operations would be interrupted if we encounter delays or difficulties securing these reagents, collection kits, sequencers, other equipment or materials or maintenance and repair services, which could occur for a variety of reasons, including if we need a replacement or temporary substitute for any of our limited or sole suppliers and are not able to locate and make arrangements with an acceptable replacement or temporary substitute. 
 5

Competition 
 Our competitors include dozens of companies focused on molecular genetic testing services, including specialty and reference laboratories that offer traditional single-gene and multi-gene tests and other COVID-19 diagnostic test providers. Principal competitors include companies such as Quest Diagnostics Incorporated; Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings; Abbott Laboratories; Perkin Elmer, Inc.; Natera, Inc.; Invitae Corporation; GeneDx, a subsidiary of OPKO Health, Inc.; Myriad Genetics, Inc.; Sema4 Genomics; Ambry Genetics, a subsidiary of Konica Minolta Inc.; Baylor Genetics; and other commercial and academic laboratories. In addition, other established and emerging healthcare, information technology and service companies may develop and sell competitive tests, which may include informatics, analysis, integrated genetic tools and services for health and wellness. 
 Additionally, participants in closely related markets, such as prenatal testing and clinical trial or companion diagnostic testing, could converge on offerings that are competitive with the type of tests we perform. Instances where potential competitors are aligned with key suppliers or are themselves suppliers could provide these potential competitors with significant advantages. Further, hospitals, research institutions and eventually individual physicians and other practitioners may also seek to perform at their own facilities the type of genetic testing we would otherwise perform for them. In this regard, continued development of, and associated decreases in the cost of, equipment, reagents and other materials and databases and genetic data interpretation services may enable broader direct participation in genetic testing and analysis and drive down the use of third-party testing companies such as ours. Additionally, cost decreases and increased direct participation, as well as cost-saving initiatives on the part of government entities and other third-party payors, could intensify the downward pressure on the price for genetic analysis and interpretation generally. Moreover, the biotechnology and genetic testing fields continue to undergo significant consolidation, permitting larger clinical laboratory service providers to increase cost efficiencies and service levels, resulting in more intense competition.
 We believe the principal competitive factors in our market are: 
  
• | breadth and depth of genetic content;
--+--------------------------------------


• | flexibility of test customization;
--+-----------------------------------


• | price of tests;
--+----------------


• | quality of results, including their reliability, accuracy and clinical actionability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | accessibility of results;
--+--------------------------


• | coverage and reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | turnaround time;
--+-----------------


• | customer service;
--+------------------


• | convenience of testing; and
--+----------------------------


• | brand recognition.
--+-------------------

 We believe we compare favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. However, many of our existing and potential future competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more expansive brand recognition and deeper market penetration, substantially greater financial, technological and research and development resources and selling and marketing capabilities and considerably more experience dealing with third-party payors. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer requirements or preferences, develop faster and better advancements for their technologies and tests, create and implement more successful strategies for the promotion and sale of their tests, obtain more favorable results from third-party payors regarding coverage and reimbursement for their offerings, adopt more aggressive pricing policies for their tests, secure supplies from vendors on more favorable terms or devote substantially more resources to infrastructure and systems development. In addition, competitors may be acquired by, receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with larger, well-established and well-financed companies as use of NGS for clinical diagnosis and preventative care increases. Further, companies or governments that effectively control access to genetic testing through umbrella contracts or regional preferences could promote our competitors or prevent us from performing certain tests in certain territories. We may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations. 
 Research and Development 
 We have assembled a highly-qualified team with expertise in a number of fields important to our business, such as bioinformatics, genetics, software engineering, laboratory management and sales and marketing. This team conducts all of our research and development activities, including efforts to develop and curate our expansive library of genetic information and further expand our technology platform.

Joint Venture
 In May 2021, we entered into a restructuring agreement with Xilong Scientific Co., Ltd., or Xilong Scientific, and Fuzhou Jinqiang Investment Partnership (LP), or FJIP, to form a joint venture under the laws of the People’s Republic of China, or PRC, resulting in the Company indirectly acquiring a controlling financial interest in Fujian Fujun Gene Biotech Co., Ltd., or FF Gene Biotech. FF Gene Biotech was founded to bring our NGS capabilities to the Chinese genetic testing market through entities separate from our U.S. operations, and FF Gene Biotech is pursuing this objective separate from our business elsewhere.
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of registered and unregistered intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, trademarks and customary contractual protections, to protect our core technology and intellectual property. 
Trade Secrets 
 We rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain and develop the competitive position afforded by many of our laboratory, analytic and business practices. For example, significant elements of our genetic tests and our testing procedures, including aspects of specimen preparation, our bioinformatics algorithms and related processes and our adaptive learning software, are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. We try to protect trade secrets and know-how by taking reasonable steps to keep them confidential, including entering into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees and certain third parties, and entering into invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions developed in the course of their work for us. 
Trademarks 
 We own registered and unregistered trademark and service mark rights under applicable U.S. and foreign law to distinguish and/or protect our brand, including our company name and logo. 
 Regulation
CLIA 
 As a clinical laboratory, we are required to hold certain federal licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, establishes quality standards for all laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. Our laboratories located in California, Texas, Georgia and Florida are CLIA-certified and are accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, a CMS-approved accrediting organization. 
 CLIA requires that we hold a certificate applicable to the categories of testing that we perform and that we comply with various standards with respect to personnel qualifications, facility administration, proficiency testing, quality control and assurance and inspections. Laboratories must obtain a certificate from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the agency that oversees CLIA, and CLIA compliance and certification is a prerequisite to be eligible to bill government payors and many private payors for our tests. 
 We are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with CLIA’s program standards, and we may be subject to additional unannounced inspections. We have CLIA certifications for our laboratories located in Temple City, California, Houston, Texas, Alpharetta, Georgia, and Jupiter, Florida. Each CLIA certification is valid for two years from the date of issuance. If either laboratory is found to be out of compliance with CLIA requirements, we may be subject to sanctions such as suspension, limitation or revocation of our CLIA certificate, a directed plan of correction, on-site monitoring, civil monetary penalties, civil injunctive suits, criminal penalties, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and significant adverse publicity. 
 In addition, we elect to participate in the accreditation program of CAP. CMS has deemed CAP standards to be equally or more stringent than CLIA regulations and has approved CAP as a recognized accrediting organization. Inspection by CAP is performed in lieu of inspection by CMS for CAP-accredited laboratories. Because we are accredited by the CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program, we are deemed to also comply with CLIA. 
 State and Foreign Laboratory Licensure 
 Our Temple City, California laboratory is required to maintain a state license issued by the California Department of Public Health, or CA DPH. California laws establish standards for day-to-day operations of our laboratory, including with respect to the training and skills required of personnel, quality control and proficiency testing requirements. If our clinical reference laboratory is out of compliance with California standards, the CA DPH may suspend, restrict or revoke our license to operate our clinical laboratory, 
 7

assess substantial civil money penalties or impose specific corrective action plans. Any such actions could materially affect our business. We maintain a current license in good standing with CA DPH. The other three states in which our laboratories are located do not require a state license.
 Additionally, several states require the licensure of out-of-state laboratories that accept specimens from those states. For example, our Houston, Texas laboratory holds the required out-of-state license to perform testing on specimens from California, and our Temple City, California laboratory holds the required out-of-state laboratory licenses to perform testing on specimens from Maryland, New York, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. For laboratories accepting samples from New York, the director of those laboratories must also maintain a Certificate of Qualification issued by New York’s Department of Health, or DOH, in permitted categories. The New York state laboratory laws and regulations are more stringent than CLIA. Among other things, the DOH requires approval on a test-specific basis before testing can be performed on specimens from New York. Our Houston, Texas laboratory does not have a permit issued by the New York DOH, but it received temporary exemption from New York to perform COVID-19 tests on specimens from New York.
 Other states may adopt similar licensure requirements in the future, which could require us to modify, delay or discontinue our operations in such jurisdictions. If we identify any other state with such requirements or if we are contacted by any other state advising us of such requirements, we intend to follow instructions from the state regulators as to how to comply with such requirements. 
 We are also subject to regulation in foreign jurisdictions, which we expect will increase as we seek to expand international utilization of our tests or if jurisdictions in which we pursue operations adopt new or modified licensure requirements. Foreign licensure requirements could require review and modification of our tests in order to offer them in certain jurisdictions or could impose other limitations, such as restrictions on the transport of human blood or other tissue necessary for us to perform our tests that may limit our ability to make our tests available outside of the United States on a broad scale. 
 FDA 
 Pursuant to its authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has jurisdiction over medical devices, which are defined to include, among other things, in vitro diagnostic products, or IVDs, used for clinical purposes. The tests that we offer may be considered IVDs and as such, medical devices. The laws and regulations governing the marketing of IVDs are evolving, extremely complex, and in many instances, there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, marketing and promotion and sales and distribution of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the import and export of medical devices. 
 The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device, are categorized as Class III. These devices typically require submission and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are categorized as either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) premarket notification submission requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the United States. Some low-risk devices are exempted from this requirement. When a 510(k) premarket notification submission is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to: (i) a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, for which PMA approval is not required, (ii) a legally marketed device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or (iii) another legally marketed, similar device that has been cleared through the 510(k) clearance process. 
 After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the Quality System Regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; labeling regulations; the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses; and the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory and enforcement powers. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product applications, and criminal prosecution. 
 Although the FDA has statutory authority to assure that medical devices, including IVDs, are safe and effective for their intended uses, the FDA has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the FDC Act 
 8

and regulations with respect to laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, which are a subset of IVDs that are intended for clinical use and designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory. We believe our tests fall within the definition of an LDT. As a result, we believe our diagnostic tests are not currently subject to the FDA’s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable FDC Act provisions. 
 Even though we commercialize our tests as LDTs, our tests may in the future become subject to more onerous regulation by the FDA. For example, in 2017, the FDA published a Discussion Paper on Laboratory Developed Tests to further public discussion about an appropriate LDT oversight approach and to give congressional committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution to the competing interests of ensuring the public health and promoting innovation in the clinical testing industry. However, on August 19, 2020, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, published a policy announcement that FDA must go through the formal notice-and-comment rulemaking process before requiring premarket review of LDTs rather than making such changes through guidance documents, compliance manuals, or other informal policy statements. HHS’s policy statement did not affect proposed legislation for the regulation of LDTs, which is discussed below. In November 2021, the Biden Administration withdrew that HHS policy announcement and ostensibly restored FDA’s regulatory oversight of LDTs.
 In December 2018, members of Congress released a discussion draft of a possible bill to regulate in vitro clinical tests including LDTs, and provided opportunities for additional stakeholders to also provide input on the proposed reform legislation. On March 5, 2020, U.S. Representatives Diana DeGette (D-CO) and Dr. Larry Bucshon (R-IN) formally introduced the long-awaited legislation, called the Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT Development, or VALID Act. An identical version of the bill was introduced concurrently in the Senate, demonstrating both bicameral and bipartisan support for the effort to overhaul how the FDA reviews and approves diagnostic tests going forward. The VALID Act would codify into law the term “in vitro clinical test”, or IVCT, to create a new medical product category separate from medical devices that includes products currently regulated as IVDs as well as LDTs. The VALID Act would also create a new system for labs and hospitals to use to submit their tests electronically to the FDA for approval, which is aimed at reducing the amount of time it takes for the agency to approve such tests, and establish a new program to expedite the development of diagnostic tests that can be used to address a current unmet need for patients. A substantively unchanged version of the VALID Act was re-introduced in both houses of Congress on June 24, 2021. 
 It is unclear whether the VALID Act would be passed by Congress in its current form or signed into law by the President. Until the FDA finalizes its position on regulation of LDTs through formal notice-and-comment rulemaking, or the VALID Act or other federal legislation is passed reforming the government’s regulation of LDTs, or alternatively, if the FDA disagrees with our assessment that our tests fall within the definition of an LDT, we could for the first time be subject to enforcement of regulatory requirements such as registration and listing requirements, medical device reporting requirements and quality control requirements. Any new legislation or formal FDA regulations affecting LDTs may result in increased regulatory burdens on our ability to continue marketing our tests and to develop and introduce new tests in the future. Additionally, if and when the FDA begins to actively enforce its premarket submission regulations with respect to LDTs generally or our tests in particular, whether as a result of new legislative authority or following formal notice-and-comment rulemaking, we may be required to obtain premarket clearance for our tests under Section 510(k) of the FDC Act or approval of a PMA. The process for submitting a 510(k) premarket notification and receiving FDA clearance usually takes from three to 12 months, but it can take significantly longer and clearance is never guaranteed. The process for submitting and obtaining FDA approval of a PMA generally takes from one to three years or even longer and approval is not guaranteed. PMA approval typically requires extensive clinical data and can be significantly longer, more expensive and more uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. If premarket review is required for some or all of our tests, the FDA could require that we stop selling our products pending clearance or approval and conduct clinical testing prior to making submissions to FDA to obtain premarket clearance or approval. The FDA could also require that we label our tests as investigational or limit the labeling claims we are permitted to make. 
 Additionally, the FDA previously solicited public input and published two draft guidance documents relating to FDA oversight of NGS-based tests. The two draft guidance documents on NGS-based tests describe the FDA’s current thinking and proposed approach regarding the possible use of FDA-recognized standards to support analytical validity, and public human genetic variant databases to support clinical validity, of these tests. The drafts were published in final form in April 2018. While it appears that the FDA is striving to provide a flexible pathway to device clearance or approval for manufacturers seeking to market NGS-based tests, it is unknown how the FDA may regulate such tests in the future and what testing and data may be required to support such clearance or approval. If premarket review is required for some or all of our tests and the FDA requires more extensive testing such as clinical trials, for example, we could experience significantly increased development costs and delays. 
 The FDA enforces its medical device requirements by various means, including inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from an Untitled Letter or Warning Letter to more severe sanctions, such as: fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; and criminal prosecution. Failure to comply with any applicable FDA requirements could trigger a range of enforcement actions by the FDA, including warning letters, civil monetary penalties, injunctions, criminal prosecution, recall 
 9

or seizure, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of operations and denial of or challenges to applications for clearance or approval, as well as significant adverse publicity.
 Advertising of Laboratory Services or LDTs
 Whether regulated by FDA as a Class I or Class II device or not directly subject to FDA’s device requirements as an LDT, our advertising for laboratory services and genetic tests is subject to federal truth-in-advertising laws enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, as well as comparable state consumer protection laws. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTC Act, the FTC is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce; (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers; and (c) gather and compile information and conduct investigations relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities engaged in commerce. The FTC has very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by the substantive requirements of the FTC Act and other consumer protection laws can result in administrative or judicial penalties, including civil penalties, injunctions affecting the manner in which we would be able to market services or products in the future, or criminal prosecution.
 Reimbursement 
 CPT Codes 
 We bill third-party payors, both commercial and government, using Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes, which are published by the American Medical Association, or AMA. CPT codes in their current form are not readily applied to many of the genetic tests we conduct. For example, for many of our multi-gene panels, there may not be an appropriate CPT code for one or more of the genes in a panel, in which case our test would be billed under a miscellaneous code for an unlisted molecular pathology procedure. Many third-party payors do not have set reimbursement fee rates for this miscellaneous code. Prior to starting a test, we negotiate the reimbursement rate with the payor if the benefits investigation has determined the test to be medically necessary and the payor has issued prior authorization. When the test results are delivered, after we file the claim, we may also need to resubmit documentation or appeal a denial, which can cause delay in the reimbursement of the claim.
 In September 2014, the AMA published new CPT codes for genomic sequencing procedures that are effective for dates of service on or after January 1, 2015. These include genomic sequencing procedure codes for certain multi-gene panel tests. In a final determination under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, published in November 2014, CMS set the 2015 payment rate for these codes using the gap-fill process. Under the gap-fill process, local Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs, establish rates for the codes that each MAC believes meet the criteria for Medicare coverage, taking into consideration laboratory charges and discounts to charges, resources, amounts paid by other third-party payors for the tests and amounts paid by the MAC for similar tests. In 2015, gap-filled payment rates were established for some, but not all, of the published codes for genomic sequencing procedures. For the codes for which local gap-filled rates were established in 2015, a national limitation amount for Medicare was established for 2016. For the codes for which local gap-filled rates were not established in 2015, associated procedures are priced by the local MACs in 2016 if an individual MAC determines that such codes should be covered. Where available, the national limitation amount serves as a cap on the Medicare payment rates for a test procedure, which may not be adequate for all of the procedures covered by the applicable codes, including our tests to the extent we are required to report them under these codes.
 PAMA 
 In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, which included substantial changes to the way in which clinical laboratory services are priced and paid under Medicare’s CLFS. On June 23, 2016, CMS published the final rule implementing the reporting and rate-setting requirements. Under PAMA, laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenue from payments made under the CLFS or the Physician Fee Schedule are required to report private payor payment rates and volumes for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests (CDLTs) to CMS every three years (or annually for advanced diagnostic laboratory test, or ADLT). We do not believe that any of our tests meet the current definition of ADLTs. We therefore must report private payor rates for our tests every three years. Laboratories that fail to report the required payment information may be subject to substantial civil monetary penalties. 
 10

As required under PAMA, CMS uses the data reported by laboratories to develop Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests equal to the volume-weighted median of the private payor payment rates. For tests furnished on or after January 1, 2010, Medicare payments for CDLTs are based upon reported private payor rates. For a CDLT that is assigned a new or substantially revised CPT code, the initial payment rate is assigned using the gap-fill methodology, as under prior law. 
 On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, which included the Laboratory Access for Beneficiaries Act, or LAB Act. The LAB Act delayed by one year the reporting of payment data under PAMA for CDLTs that are not ADLTs until the first quarter of 2021. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, delayed the reporting period by an additional year, until the first quarter of 2022. Then, on December 10, 2021, Congress passed the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act, which included a provision that further delayed the next PAMA reporting period for CDLTs that are not ADLTs to January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2023. New CLFS rates for CDLTs will be established based on that data beginning in 2024, subject to phase-in limits. As a result, Medicare payment rates determined by data reported in 2017 will continue through December 31, 2023. 
 In addition, under PAMA, as amended, the payment reduction cap will be 15% per test per year in each of the years 2023 through 2025. 
 Privacy and Security Laws and Patient Information Access
 HIPAA and HITECH 
 Under the Administrative Simplification provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations (“HIPAA Regulations”) that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and requirements for protecting the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically, known as covered entities. As a clinical laboratory, we are acting as a covered entity and are subject to HIPAA and HITECH. The following four principal regulations with which we are required to comply have been issued in final form under HIPAA and HITECH: privacy regulations, security regulations, the breach notification rule and standards for electronic transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions. 
 The privacy regulations of HIPAA and HITECH protect medical records and other PHI by limiting their use and release, giving patients a variety of rights, including the right to access their medical records and limiting most disclosures of health information to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose. HIPAA also requires covered entities to enter into business associate agreements to obtain a written assurance of compliance with HIPAA from individuals or organizations who provide services to covered entities involving the use or disclosure of PHI, or also known as business associates. As a general rule, a covered entity or business associate may not use or disclose PHI except as permitted under the privacy regulations of HIPAA and HITECH. 
 Covered entities must also comply with the security regulations of HIPAA and HITECH, which establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI. The HIPAA security regulations require the implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures.
 In addition, HITECH established, among other things, certain breach notification requirements with which covered entities must comply. In particular, a covered entity must report breaches of PHI that have not been encrypted or otherwise secured in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of HHS, or the Secretary. Required breach notices must be made as soon as is reasonably practicable, but no later than sixty days following discovery of the breach. Reports must be made to affected individuals, the Secretary, and depending on the size of the breach, the local and national media. Covered entities are also subject to audit under HHS’s HITECH-mandated audit program and may be investigated in connection with privacy or data security.
 There are significant civil and criminal fines and other penalties that may be imposed for violating HIPAA. A covered entity or business associate is liable for civil monetary penalties for a violation that is based on an act or omission of any of its agents, including a downstream business associate, as determined according to the federal common law of agency. Penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA and HITECH vary significantly depending on the failure and include civil monetary penalties of up to $1.8 million per violation of the same requirement per calendar year (as of November 2021, subject to annual inflation adjustments). A single breach incident can violate multiple requirements, resulting in potential penalties in excess of approximately $1.8 million. Additionally, a person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to $50,000 and up to one year of imprisonment. These criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to sell, transfer or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Covered entities are also subject to enforcement by state attorneys general who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH. Further, to the extent that we submit electronic healthcare claims and payment transactions that do not 
 11

comply with the electronic data transmission standards established under HIPAA and HITECH, payments to us may be delayed or denied. 
 In addition to our clinical laboratory services, we provide management and technology services to certain companies, institutions, and agencies that are covered entities and have entered into business associate agreements with these entities as business associates. In addition to being directly responsible for compliance with applicable HITECH Act requirements and HIPAA regulations as a business associate, we have contractually agreed to comply with HIPAA, HITECH, and HIPAA Regulations and in some instances have agreed to indemnify our covered entity clients if we breach our obligations with respect to these laws and regulations and/or in the event of a reportable breach of protected health information. 
 The HIPAA privacy, security, and breach notification regulations establish a uniform federal “floor” but do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing PHI or insofar as such state laws apply to personal information that is broader in scope than PHI as defined under HIPAA. The compliance requirements of these laws, including additional breach reporting requirements, and the penalties for violation vary widely and new privacy and security laws in this area are evolving. For example, several states, such as California, have implemented comprehensive privacy laws and regulations. The California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, or CMIA, imposes restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information. In addition to fines and penalties imposed upon violators, some of these state laws also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. California’s patient privacy laws, for example, provide for penalties of up to $250,000 and permit injured parties to sue for damages. In addition to the CMIA, California recently adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which came into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Although the CCPA does not directly apply to medical information covered by HIPAA or CMIA, certain other personal information that our business may collect and use does not fall under the CCPA exception. On November 3, 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which expands the CCPA. The CPRA will be fully effective in January of 2023 and, among other things, establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency, or CPPA, a new regulatory authority charged with administering and enforcing the CRPA and privacy rights in California. The CPPA will have the power to levy fines and bring other enforcement actions. The CPRA could impact our operations or that of our collaborators and business partners and impose new regulatory requirements and increase costs of compliance. Other states are considering expanded privacy legislation similar to the GDPR and CPRA, with Virginia and Colorado enacting their own consumer privacy laws in 2021 similar to CCPA and CPRA.  Both the Virginia and Colorado laws take full effect in 2023. There are also several federal privacy proposals under consideration in Congress and other states have already introduced privacy legislation for consideration in 2022.
 Many states have also implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and requirements for protecting test results. The interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our clients and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity, and liability. Further, as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related, and data protection laws are often uncertain, contradictory, and in flux. The applicability and requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy or security, could result in civil and/or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Numerous other federal, state and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of patient health information. In addition, Congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information. With the recent increase in publicity regarding data breaches resulting in improper dissemination of consumer information, all 50 states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach, as defined by state law, including prompt disclosure within a specified amount of time to affected individuals. Congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data privacy and data protection. The FTC and states’ Attorneys General have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act and comparable state laws. In addition to data breach notification laws, some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information. We intend to continue to comprehensively protect all personal information and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of such information.

Information Blocking Rules
 The National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (“ONC”) coordinates the ongoing development of standards to enable interoperable health information technology infrastructure nationwide in the healthcare sector. In May 2020, ONC released the final Information Blocking Rule to implement the interoperability and patient access provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act. We will need to continually engage in ongoing reviews of all potential practices that could be considered likely to interfere with access, exchange or use of electronic health information, as those practices are prohibited by the Information Blocking Rule unless one of the exceptions outlined in the Information Blocking Rule applies. Among other things, the Information Blocking Rule requires us to provide patients with on-demand access to laboratory test results. These requirements can be inconsistent with our obligations under state law and/or medical or ethical standards. It is currently unclear how the ONC will approach delays in providing patient access in these situations. Health care providers including laboratories will be subject to civil monetary penalties for violations of the Information Blocking Rule once the penalty regulations are finalized; the proposed rule allows for up to $1 million in penalties per violation. 
Foreign Laws 
 We are also subject to foreign privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which we sell our tests. The interpretation, application and interplay of consumer and health-related data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and Cybersecurity Directive have been enacted in the European Union and became effective in May 2018. These texts introduced many changes to privacy and security in the European Union, including stricter rules on consent and security duties for critical industries, including for the health sector. The interpretation of some rules continues to evolve in guidance from the main regulatory authority, the European Data Protection Board, and some requirements may be completed by national legislation. This makes it difficult to assess the impact of these new data protection laws on our business at this time. More generally, foreign laws and interpretations governing data privacy and security are constantly evolving and it is possible that laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our current practices, in which case we could be subject to government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices. These fines can be very high. For instance, the GDPR introduces fines of up to approximately $22 million or 4% of a group’s worldwide annual turnover for certain infringements. In addition, privacy regulations differ widely from country to country and are enforced by individual country data protection authorities, which have power to enforce privacy regulations.  Various data protection authorities have issued fines in the millions of euros for violations of privacy laws. 
 In many activities, including the conduct of clinical trials, we are subject to laws and regulations governing data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. These laws and regulations govern our processing of personal data, including the collection, access, use, analysis, modification, storage, transfer, security breach notification, destruction and disposal of personal data. We must comply with laws and regulations associated with the international transfer of personal data based on the location in which the personal data originates and the location in which it is processed.
 If we or our vendors fail to comply with applicable data privacy laws, or if the legal mechanisms we or our vendors rely upon to allow for the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States (or other countries not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection) are not considered adequate, we could be subject to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and our business could be adversely impacted if our ability to transfer personal data outside of the European Union is restricted, which could adversely impact our operating results. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to European Union personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR. However, our ongoing efforts related to compliance with the GDPR may not be successful and could increase our cost of doing business. In addition, data protection authorities of the different European Union member states may interpret the GDPR differently, and guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the European Union. In addition to the GDPR, other countries have enacted data protection legislation which increase the complexity of doing international business and transferring sensitive personal information from those countries to the United States.
 The privacy and security of personally identifiable information stored, maintained, received or transmitted, including electronically, subject to significant regulation in the United States and abroad. While we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations, legal standards for privacy continue to evolve and any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 In the United States, we must comply with various fraud and abuse laws, and we are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities, including CMS, other divisions of HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of 
 13

Justice, individual U.S. Attorney’s Offices within the Department of Justice and state and local governments. We also may be subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws. 
 Anti-Kickback and Fraud Statutes 
 In the United States, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in order to induce or in return for the referral of an individual for the furnishing of, or the recommending or arranging for the furnishing of, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part by a federal healthcare program. Courts have stated that a financial arrangement may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute if any one purpose of the arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, consulting fees, waivers of co-payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, although it does contain several exceptions. HHS has issued a series of regulatory “safe harbors” setting forth certain provisions that, if met, will immunize the parties to the arrangement from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with the statutory exceptions or regulatory safe harbors ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. Furthermore, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are severe and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can serve as a basis of liability under the federal False Claims Act (described below). Many states also have anti-kickback statutes, some of which may apply regardless of payor type. 
 In addition, in October 2018, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018, or EKRA, was enacted as part of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act. EKRA is an all-payer anti-kickback law that makes it a criminal offense to pay any remuneration to induce referrals to, or in exchange for, patients using the services of a recovery home, a substance use clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. However, unlike the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, EKRA is not limited to services covered by federal or state health care programs but applies more broadly to services covered by “health care benefit programs,” including commercial insurers. Although it appears that EKRA was intended to reach patient brokering and similar arrangements to induce patronage of substance use recovery and treatment, the language in EKRA is broadly written. Further, certain of EKRA’s exceptions are inconsistent with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and regulations. Significantly, EKRA permits the U.S. Department of Justice to issue regulations clarifying EKRA’s exceptions or adding additional exceptions, but such regulations have not yet been issued.
 There are also U.S. federal laws related to healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government payor programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. A violation of this statute is also a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government payor programs. 
 False Claims Act 
 Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased enforcement of the federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action under the False Claims Act on behalf of the federal government and permit such an individual to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition, providers and suppliers must report and return any overpayments received from the Medicare and Medicaid programs within 60 days of identification. Failure to identify and return such overpayments exposes the provider or supplier to False Claims Act liability. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim, as set by statute. However, the civil penalty amounts are adjusted annually for inflation. For civil penalties assessed after June 19, 2020, whose associated violations occurred after November 2, 2015, the civil penalty amount ranges between $11,665 and $23,331 per claim; as of December 13, 2021, the amounts increased to $11,803 and $23,607 per claim.
 14

In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a government payor program. 
 Civil Monetary Penalties Law 
 The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or the CMP Law, prohibits, among other things, (1) the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; (2) employing or contracting with an individual or entity that the provider knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal health care program; (3) billing for services requested by an unlicensed physician or an excluded provider; and (4) billing for medically unnecessary services. The penalties for violating the CMP Law include exclusion, substantial fines, and payment of up to three times the amount billed, depending on the nature of the offense.
Physician Referral Prohibitions 
 The U.S. federal law directed at “self-referrals,” commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain designated health services, including laboratory services, that are covered by the Medicare program, to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member has a direct or indirect financial relationship, unless an exception applies. Violation of the Stark Law results in a denial of payment for any services provided pursuant to a prohibited referral. A physician or entity that engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s referral prohibition may be fined up to $174,172 (which reflects the annual adjustment for inflation effective as of November 15, 2021) for each such arrangement or scheme. In addition, any person who presents or causes to be presented a claim to the Medicare program in violation of the Stark Law is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $26,125 per service (which reflects the annual inflation adjustment effective as of November 15, 2021), an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, meaning that a physician’s financial relationship with a laboratory must meet an exception under the Stark Law or the referrals are prohibited. Thus, unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute’s safe harbors, if a laboratory’s financial relationship with a referring physician does not meet the requirements of a Stark Law exception, then the physician is prohibited from making Medicare and Medicaid referrals to the laboratory and any such referrals will result in overpayments to the laboratory and subject the laboratory to the Stark Law’s penalties. A violation of the Stark Law can serve as a basis of liability under the federal False Claims Act. Many states, including California, have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare referrals. The Stark Law also prohibits state receipt of federal Medicaid matching funds for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral, but this provision of the Stark Law has not been implemented by regulations.
Physician Sunshine Laws 
 The Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes reporting requirements on manufacturers of certain devices, drugs and biologics for certain payments and transfers of value by them (and in some cases their distributors) to physicians, teaching hospitals and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reporting program (known as the Open Payments program) is administered by CMS. Because we manufacture our own LDTs solely for use by or within our own laboratory, we believe we are exempt from these reporting requirements. We may become subject to such reporting requirements under the terms of current CMS regulations, however, if the VALID Act or other legislation renders our tests regulated by FDA or if FDA engages in notice-and-comment rulemaking to exercise authority over LDTs or otherwise requires us to obtain premarket clearance or approval for our tests.
 Anti-Bribery Laws 
 FCPA 
 We are subject to U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making payments in violation of law to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage. The sale of our tests internationally demands a high degree of vigilance in maintaining, implementing and enforcing a policy against participation in corrupt activity. Other U.S. companies in the medical device and pharmaceutical fields have faced substantial monetary fines and criminal penalties under the FCPA for allowing their agents to deviate from appropriate practices in doing business with non-U.S. government officials.
Foreign Laws 
 We are also subject to similar anti-bribery laws in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offence. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act of 2010,

which became effective in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public or private nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act of 2010. An individual found in violation of the Bribery Act of 2010 faces imprisonment of up to 10 years and could be subject to an unlimited fine, as could commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery. 
 Healthcare Policy Laws 
 In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was enacted in the United States. The ACA made a number of substantial changes to the way healthcare is financed both by governmental and private payors. Although the ACA included a medical device tax, the tax never went into effect and was fully repealed by Congress with enactment of the 2019 federal spending package signed into law by President Trump on December 20, 2019.
 Since the ACA’s enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and as a result, certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or were effectively repealed. However, following several years of litigation in the federal courts, in June 2021, the United States Supreme Court, or the Supreme Court, upheld the ACA when it dismissed a legal challenge to the Act’s constitutionality. Further legislative and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible, although the new Democrat-led presidential administration has been taking steps to strengthen the ACA and the 117th Congress is not expected to have the same interest in repealing the law, in part due to the healthcare economic impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on many subsets of the U.S. population. Future changes or additions to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, such as changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices, and changes stemming from other health care reform measures, especially with regard to health care access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the health care industry in the U.S. The uncertainty around the future of the ACA, and in particular the impact to reimbursement levels and the number of insured individuals, may lead to delay in the purchasing decisions of our customers. 
 In addition to the ACA, there will likely continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and private third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. 
 Corporate Practice of Medicine 
 Numerous states have enacted laws prohibiting business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine, generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. These laws are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. For example, California’s Medical Board has indicated that determining the appropriate diagnostic tests for a particular condition and taking responsibility for the ultimate overall care of a patient, including providing treatment options available to the patient, would constitute the unlicensed practice of medicine if performed by an unlicensed person. Violation of these corporate practice of medicine laws may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against the business corporation and/or the professional through licensure proceedings. 
Environmental and Other Regulatory Requirements 
 Our laboratory is subject on an ongoing basis to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemicals, biological agents and compounds and blood and other tissue specimens. Typically, we use licensed or otherwise qualified outside vendors to dispose of this waste. However, many of these laws and regulations provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. As a result, we could be held liable for damages and fines if our, or others’, business operations or other actions result in contamination of the environment or personal injury due to exposure to hazardous materials. Our costs for complying with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated or predicted and depends on a number of factors, including the amount and nature of waste we produce (which depends in part on the number of tests we perform) and the terms we negotiate with our waste disposal vendors. 
 Our operations are also subject to extensive requirements established by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration relating to workplace safety for healthcare employees, including requirements to develop and implement programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens by preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick or similar penetrating injuries.

Employees and Human Capital Resources
We believe growing and retaining a strong team is crucial to our success. As of February 1, 2022, we had 645 full-time employees, engaged in bioinformatics, genetics, COVID-19 and molecular testing, software engineering, laboratory management, sales and marketing and corporate and administrative activities. Consistent with our core belief in the values of diversity and inclusion, as of February 1, 2022, underrepresented minorities (which include women, Asian and Hispanic) made up 50% or more of each major level of our organization, including our board of directors, senior management and rank and file staff. To encourage the professional and personal development of every Fulgent employee, we offer certain reimbursement for qualified educational expenses and successful completion of undergraduate, graduate, post-graduate, professional training, and licensure courses from accredited colleges, universities and professional organizations. We also provide mandatory training courses on a variety of topics, including discrimination, anti-corruption and anti-bribery through third party providers. As we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and to help limit exposure to COVID-19, we have acted to protect employees in business-critical functions who cannot work from home, including those in research and development, quality, accessioning, curation, distribution, and sales. Personal protective equipment, increased sanitation, social distancing guidance, and facility updates (one-way hallways, cafeteria partitions and extra sinks) are provided to protect our employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
Corporate Information
 We were incorporated in Delaware on May 13, 2016. We are the holding company of our subsidiaries, including primarily Fulgent Therapeutics LLC, which was initially formed in June 2011.

 Our initial operations focused on Fulgent Therapeutics LLC’s former pharmaceutical business, or the Pharma Business, and in 2013 we commenced the genetic testing business we are currently pursuing. In October 2015, we recapitalized Fulgent Therapeutics LLC to establish two series of units, with the Class D units having economic rights based on the genetic testing business we are currently pursuing and the Class P units having economic rights based on the Pharma Business. On April 4, 2016, Fulgent Therapeutics LLC separated the Pharma Business from the genetic testing business we are currently pursuing.
