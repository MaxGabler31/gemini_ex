Business Overview
Energy Fuels is engaged in conventional and in situ recovery (“ISR”) uranium extraction and recovery, along with the exploration, permitting, and evaluation of uranium properties in the United States. The Company also extracts and recovers vanadium from certain of its uranium projects, as market conditions warrant. In 2021, the Company commenced its ramp-up to commercial production of rare earth element (“REE”) carbonate (“RE Carbonate”), another byproduct of the uranium recovery process, and is evaluating the potential to recover isotopes from its existing process streams needed for emerging targeted alpha therapy (“TAT”) cancer therapeutics.
The Company's Mill, located near Blanding, San Juan County, Utah, is the only conventional uranium, vanadium and REE recovery facility operating in the U.S., having a licensed capacity of over 8 million pounds of U3O8 per year. In addition to uranium, the Mill can recover vanadium as a co-product of mineralized material produced from certain of its projects in Colorado and Utah and from solutions in its tailings impoundment system, as market conditions warrant. The Mill is also currently producing RE Carbonate from various uranium- and REE-bearing ores acquired from third parties and is actively

engaged in discussions to secure its own sources of monazite sands or other REE deposits in furtherance of a fully integrated U.S.-based REE supply chain. In addition, Energy Fuels recovers uranium from other uranium-bearing materials not derived from conventional material, referred to as “Alternate Feed Materials,” at its Mill, thereby recycling materials back into the market that would otherwise be lost to direct disposal.
With its uranium, vanadium, REE and potentially radioisotope production, the Mill is quickly becoming a critical minerals hub for the U.S. Uranium, which is the fuel for carbon-free, emission-free baseload nuclear power, is one of the cleanest forms of energy in the world. The REEs we are now producing are used for the manufacture of permanent magnets for electric vehicles, wind turbines and other clean energy and modern technologies, and the radioisotopes we are evaluating for recovery from our REE and uranium processing streams have the potential to provide the isotopes needed for emerging TAT cancer-fighting therapeutics. The very heart of our business – uranium and rare-earth production and recycling – helps us play a big part in addressing global climate change, reducing air pollution, and making the world a cleaner and healthier place. 
In terms of conventional mining, the Company owns uranium and uranium/vanadium properties and projects in various stages of exploration, permitting, and evaluation, as well as fully permitted uranium and uranium/vanadium projects on standby. 
Energy Fuels also owns the Nichols Ranch Uranium Recovery Facility in Wyoming (the “Nichols Ranch Project”), which is a fully permitted uranium ISR facility with a licensed capacity of 2 million pounds of U3O8 per year, and the Alta Mesa Project in Texas (the “Alta Mesa Project”), which is also a fully permitted ISR uranium production facility with a licensed capacity of 1.5 million pounds of U3O8 per year, both of which are currently on standby. 
ISR Operations
The Company conducts its ISR activities through (i) its Nichols Ranch Project in northeast Wyoming, which it acquired in June 2015 through its acquisition of Uranerz Energy Corporation (“Uranerz”), and (ii) its Alta Mesa Project in south Texas, which the Company acquired in June 2016 through its acquisition of Mesteña Uranium, LLC (“Mesteña”), which is now named EFR Alta Mesa LLC (“EFR Alta Mesa”). 
The Nichols Ranch Project includes: (i) a licensed and operating ISR processing facility (the “Nichols Ranch Plant”); (ii) licensed and operating ISR wellfields (the “Nichols Ranch Wellfields”); (iii) additional licensed ISR wellfields planned for future production (the “Jane Dough Property”), and; (iv) a licensed satellite ISR uranium project (the “Hank Project”), which will include an ISR satellite processing plant (the “Hank Satellite Plant”) that, when constructed, will produce loaded-resin, and associated planned wellfields (the “Hank Property”). See “The Nichols Ranch ISR Project” under Item 2 below. Also through the acquisition of Uranerz, the Company acquired the West North Butte property (the “West North Butte Property”) and the North Rolling Pin property (the “North Rolling Pin Property”), as well as the Arkose Mining Venture (the “Arkose Mining Venture”), which is a joint venture of Wyoming ISR properties held 81% by Energy Fuels. 
The Nichols Ranch Project is an ISR facility currently on standby that recovers uranium through a series of injection and recovery wells. Using groundwater fortified with oxygen and sodium bicarbonate, uranium is dissolved within a deposit. The uranium-bearing groundwater is then collected in a series of recovery wells and pumped to the Nichols Ranch Plant where the uranium is extracted from the water. The Nichols Ranch Plant creates a yellowcake slurry that is transported by truck to the White Mesa Mill, where it is dried and packaged into drums that are shipped to uranium conversion facilities.
Construction of the Nichols Ranch Plant, other than the elution, drying and packaging circuits, was completed in 2013, and it commenced uranium recovery activities in the second quarter of 2014. In September of 2015, the Company commenced construction of an elution circuit at the Nichols Ranch Plant, which was completed and began operations in February 2016. The Nichols Ranch Project was placed on standby in 2020. As a result, the Company recovered de minimis pounds of U3O8 from the Project in 2021 and expects to recover de minimis quantities of U3O8 in 2022. Nichols Ranch is expected to be able to ramp back up to commercial production levels with limited required capital within approximately twelve months of a production decision. See Part II, Item 7 “Outlook: ISR Activities.”
The Alta Mesa Project is a fully licensed, permitted and constructed ISR processing facility that has an operating capacity of 1.5 million pounds of uranium per year and comprises a total of 195,501 contiguous acres of land. The Alta Mesa Project is currently on standby and ready to resume production, as market conditions warrant. It is expected to be able to reach commercial production levels with limited required capital within approximately twelve months of a production decision. See “The Alta Mesa Project” under Part I, Item 2 below. 
Conventional Operations
The Company conducts its conventional uranium, REE, vanadium and potential medical isotope extraction and recovery activities through the Mill, which is the only operating conventional uranium, REE and vanadium processing facility in the
