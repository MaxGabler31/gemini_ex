 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  Corporate History and Background
  
  Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. was incorporated in October, 2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada as Pole Perfect Studios, Inc. (“PPS”).
  
  On November 23, 2010, we entered into and closed a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) between the major shareholders of PPS and the shareholders of Torchlight Energy, Inc. (“TEI”). As a result of the transactions effected by the Exchange Agreement, at closing TEI became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and the business of TEI became our sole business. TEI is an energy company, incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in June, 2010. We are engaged in the acquisition, exploration, exploitation, and/or development of oil and natural gas properties in the United States. We operate our business through TEI and four other wholly-owned subsidiaries, Torchlight Energy Operating, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, Hudspeth Oil Corporation, a Texas corporation, Torchlight Hazel LLC, a Texas limited liability company, and Warwink Properties LLC, a Texas limited liability company.
 Business Overview
  
  Our business model is to focus on drilling and working interest programs within the United States, primarily in basins or areas with known geology such as the Permian Basin in West Texas. We have interests in four oil and gas projects, which projects are described in more detail below in the section titled “Current Projects.” We anticipate being involved in other oil and gas projects moving forward, pending adequate funding. We anticipate acquiring exploration and development projects both as a non-operating working interest partner, participating in drilling activities primarily on a basis proportionate to the working interest, and acquiring properties we can operate. We intend to spread the risk associated with drilling programs by entering into a variety of programs in different fields with differing economics.
  
  The core strategy of the Company is pursuing the ongoing development of its assets in the Permian basin consisting of the Orogrande and the Hazel Projects. These West Texas properties demonstrate significant value potential and future production capabilities based upon the analysis of scientific data already gathered in the day by day development activity. Therefore, the Board has determined to focus its efforts and capital on these two projects to maximize shareholder value for the long run.
  
  Key Business Attributes
  
  Experienced People. We build on the expertise and experiences of our management team, including John Brda and Roger Wurtele. We will also receive guidance from outside advisors as well as our Board of Directors and will align with high quality exploration and technical partners.
  
  Project Focus. We are focusing primarily on exploitation projects by pursuing resources in areas where commercial production has already been established but where opportunity for additional and nearby development is indicated. We may pursue high risk exploration prospects which may appear less favored than low risk exploration. We will, however, consider these high risk-high reward exploration prospects in connection with exploitation opportunities in a project that would reduce the overall project economic risk. We will consider such high risk-high reward prospects on their individual merits.
  
  Lower Cost Structure. We will attempt to maintain the lowest possible cost structure, enabling the greatest margins and providing opportunities for investment that would not be feasible for higher cost competitors.
  
  Limit Capital Risks. Limited capital exposure is planned initially to add value to a project and determine its economic viability. Projects are staged and have options before additional capital is invested. We will limit our exposure in any one project by participating at reduced working interest levels, thereby being able to diversify with limited capital. Management has experience in successfully managing risks of projects, finance, and value.
  
  Project Focus
  
  Generally, we will focus on exploitation projects (primarily for oil, although gas projects will be considered if the economics are favorable). Projects are first identified, evaluated, and followed by the engagement of third party operating or financial partners. Subject to overall availability of capital, our interest in large capital projects will be limited. Each opportunity will be investigated on a standalone basis for both technical and financial merit.
  
  We will be actively seeking quality new investment opportunities to sustain our growth, and we believe we will have access to many new projects. The sources of these opportunities will vary but all will be evaluated with the same criteria of technical and economic factors. It is expected that projects will come from the many small producers who find themselves under-funded or over-extended and therefore vulnerable to price volatility. The financial ability to respond quickly to opportunities will ensure a continuous stream of projects and will enable us to negotiate from a stronger position to enhance value.

  ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued
  
  With emphasis on acquisitions and development strategies, the types of projects in which we will be involved vary from increased production due to simple re-engineering of existing wellbores to step-out drilling, drilling horizontally, and extensions of known fields. Recompletion of existing wellbores in new zones, development of deeper zones and detailing of structure, and stratigraphic traps with three-dimensional seismic and utilization of new technologies will all be part of our anticipated program. Our preferred type of projects are in-fills to existing production with nearly immediate cash flow and/or adjacent or on trend to existing production. We will prefer projects with moderate to low risk, unrecognized upside potential, and geographic diversity.
 Business Processes
  
  We believe there are three principal business processes that we must follow to enable our operations to be profitable. Each major business process offers the opportunity for a distinct partner or alliance as we grow. These processes are:

● | Investment Evaluation and Review;
--+----------------------------------


● | Operations and Field Activities; and
--+-------------------------------------


● | Administrative and Finance Management.
--+---------------------------------------


 
  Investment Evaluation and Review. This process is the key ingredient to our success. Recognition of quality investment opportunities is the fuel that drives our engine. Broadly, this process includes the following activities: prospect acquisition, regional and local geological and geophysical evaluations, data processing, economic analysis, lease acquisition and negotiations, permitting, and field supervision. We expect these evaluation processes to be managed by our management team. Expert or specific technical support will be outsourced as needed. Only if a project is taken to development, and only then, will additional staff be hired. New personnel will have very specific responsibilities. We anticipate attractive investment opportunities to be presented from outside companies and from the large informal community of geoscientists and engineers. Building a network of advisors is key to the pipeline of high quality opportunities.
  
  Operations and Field Activities. This process begins following management approval of an investment. Well site supervision, construction, drilling, logging, product marketing, and transportation are examples of some activities. We will prefer to be the operator, but when operations are not possible, we will farm-out sufficient interests to third parties that will be responsible for these operating activities. We provide personnel to monitor these activities and associated costs.
  
  Administrative and Finance Management. This process coordinates our initial structuring and capitalization, general operations and accounting, reporting, audit, banking and cash management, regulatory agencies reporting and interaction, timely and accurate payment of royalties, taxes, leases rentals, vendor accounts and performance management that includes budgeting and maintenance of financial controls, and interface with legal counsel and tax and other financial and business advisors.
  
  Current Projects
  
  As of December 31, 2017 the Company had interests in four oil and gas projects:, the Orogrande Project in Hudspeth County, Texas, and the Hazel Project in Sterling, Tom Green, and Irion Counties, Texas, the Winkler Project in Winkler County, Texas, and the Hunton wells in partnership with Husky Ventures in Central Oklahoma .
 Orogrande Project, West Texas
  
  On August 7, 2014, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Hudspeth Oil Corporation (“Hudspeth”), McCabe Petroleum Corporation (“MPC”), and Greg McCabe. Mr. McCabe was the sole owner of both Hudspeth and MPC. Under the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, at closing, we purchased 100% of the capital stock of Hudspeth which holds certain oil and gas assets, including a 100% working interest in 172,000 mostly contiguous acres in the Orogrande Basin in West Texas. As of December 31, 2017, leases covering 133,000 acres remain in effect. This acreage is in the primary term under five-year leases that carry additional five-year extension provisions. As consideration, at closing we issued 868,750 shares of our common stock to Mr. McCabe and paid a total of $100,000 in geologic origination fees to third parties. Additionally, Mr. McCabe has, at his option, a 10% working interest back-in after payout and a reversionary interest if drilling obligations are not met, all under the terms and conditions of a participation and development agreement. All drilling obligations through December 31, 2017 have been met.
  
  On September 23, 2015, our subsidiary, Hudspeth Oil Corporation (“HOC”), entered into a Farmout Agreement by and between HOC, Pandora Energy, LP (“Pandora”), Founders Oil & Gas, LLC (“Founders”), McCabe Petroleum Corporation and Greg McCabe (McCabe Petroleum Corporation and Greg McCabe are parties to the Farmout Agreement for limited purposes) for the entire Orogrande Project in Hudspeth County, Texas. The Farmout Agreement provided for Founders to earn from HOC and Pandora (collectively, the “Farmor”) an undivided 50% of the leasehold interest in the Orogrande Project by Founder’s spending a minimum of $45 million on actual drilling operations on the Orogrande Project in the following two years.
  
  Under a joint operating agreement (on A.A.P.L. Form 610 – 1989 Model Form Operating Agreement with COPAS 2005 Accounting Procedures) (“JOA”) also entered into on September 23, 2015, Founders is designated as operator of the leases.

  ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued
 
 On March 22, 2017, the Company, along with Founders, their operating partner, signed a Drilling and Development Unit (DDU) Agreement with University Lands on its Orogrande Basin Project. The agreement has an effective date of January 1, 2017 and required a payment from both Torchlight and Founders of $335,323 as part of the extension fee. Torchlight's portion of the fee was paid by Founders in April 2017 and will be deducted from the required spud fee payable to Torchlight at commencement of the next well drilled.
  
 The DDU agreement allows for all 192 existing leases covering the 133,000 net acres leased from University Lands to be combined into one lease for development purposes. The time to drill on the unit is extended through April of 2023 on the first extension. The agreement also grants exclusive right to continue through April of 2028 if compliance with the agreement is met and extension fee associated with the additional time paid. The Company's drilling obligations begin with one well in the first year, and increase to five wells per year by year 2023. The drilling obligation set is a minimum requirement and may be exceeded if acceleration is desired. The DDU agreement replaces all prior agreements and will govern future drilling obligations on the lease.
  
  The Orogrande Rich A-11 test well that was drilled by Torchlight in second quarter, 2015 was evaluated and numerous scientific tests were performed to provide key data for the field development thesis. Future utility of this well may be conversion to a salt water disposal well in the course of further development of the Orogrande acreage.
  
  The second test well, the University Founders B-19 #1, was spudded on April 24, 2016 and drilled in second quarter, 2016. The well successfully pumped down completion fluid in the third quarter of 2016 and indications of hydrocarbons were seen at the surface on this second Orogrande Project test well. Future utility of this well may be conversion to a salt water disposal well in the course of further development of the Orogrande acreage.
 
  During the fourth quarter, 2017, the Company took back operational control from Founders Oil and Gas on the Orogrande Basin Project. Torchlight was joined by Wolfbone Investments, LLC, ("Wolfbone"), a company owned by Greg McCabe, Torchlight's Chairman. The two entities have entered into an Assignment of Farmout Agreement with Founders and will share the remaining commitments under the prior agreement with Founders. All original provisions of Torchlight's carried interest will remain in place including reimbursement to the Company on each wellbore. Founders will remain a 9.5% Working Interest owner in the project under the agreement for the $9.5 million it has spent to date and be carried until the remaining $40.5 million is spent by Wolfbone and Torchlight, with each contributing 50% of that capital spend, under the existing agreement. Torchlight's interest in the Project thereby increased by 20.25% Working Interest to a total of 67.75% and Wolfbone now owns 20.25%.
 
  Founders will operate a newly drilled well called the University Founders #A25 with supervision from Torchlight and its Partners. The University Founders #A25 was spudded on the 27th of November and satisfies the obligation under the University Lands D&D Agreement. Once the #A25 is completed Torchlight will assume full operational control including managing drilling plans and timing for all future wells drilled in the Project.
 
  Hazel Project in the Midland Basin in West Texas
  
  Effective April 1, 2016, Torchlight Energy Inc. acquired from McCabe Petroleum Corporation, a 66.66% working interest in approximately 12,000 acres in the Midland Basin in exchange for 1,500,000 warrants to purchase our common stock with an exercise price of $1.00 for five years and a back-in after payout of a 25% working interest to the seller.
  
  Initial development of the first well on the property, the Flying B Ranch #1, began July 10, 2016 and development continued through September 30, 2016. This well is classified as a test well in the development pursuit of the Hazel Project. It is anticipated that this wellbore will be utilized as a salt water disposal well in support of future development.
  
 In October, 2016, the holders of the Company's Series C Preferred shares (which were issued in July, 2016) elected to convert into a 33.33% Working Interest in the Company's Hazel Project, reducing Torchlight's ownership from 66.66% to a 33.33% Working Interest.
  
 On December 27, 2016, drilling activities commenced on the second Hazel Project well, the Flying B Ranch #2. The well is a vertical test similar to the Company's first Hazel Project well, the Flying B Ranch #1. Recompletion in an alternative geological formation for this well was performed during the three months ended September 30, 2017 however the results were uneconomic for continuing production. It is anticipated that this wellbore will be utilized as a salt water disposal well in support of future development.
  
 The Company commenced planning to drill a horizontal well in the Project in June, 2017 in compliance with the continuous drilling obligation. The well, the Flying B Ranch #3, was spudded on June 10, 2017. The well was completed and began production in late September, 2017.

  Acquisition of Additional Interests in Hazel Project
  
 On January 30, 2017, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Torchlight Acquisition Corporation, a Texas corporation (“TAC”), entered into and closed an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Plan of Merger with Line Drive Energy, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Line Drive”), under which agreements TAC merged with and into Line Drive and the separate existence of TAC ceased, with Line Drive being the surviving organization and becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary. Line Drive, which was wholly-owned by Gregory McCabe, our Chairman, owned certain assets and securities, including approximately 40.66% of 12,000 gross acres in the Hazel Project and 521,739 warrants to purchase our common stock (which warrants had been assigned by Mr. McCabe to Line Drive). Under the merger transaction, our shares of common stock of TAC converted into a membership interest of Line Drive, the membership interest in Line Drive held by Mr. McCabe immediately prior to the transaction ceased to exist, and we issued Mr. McCabe 3,301,739 restricted shares of common stock as consideration therefor. Immediately after closing, the 521,739 warrants held by Line Drive were cancelled, which warrants had an exercise price of $1.40 per share and an expiration date of June 9, 2020. A Certificate of Merger for the merger transaction was filed with the Secretary of State of Texas on January 31, 2017. Subsequent to the closing the name of Line Drive Energy, LLC was changed to Torchlight Hazel, LLC.
  
 Also on January 30, 2017, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Torchlight Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“TEI”), entered into and closed a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Wolfbone Investments, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Wolfbone”) which is wholly-owned by Gregory McCabe, our Chairman. Under the agreement, TEI acquired certain of Wolfbone’s Hazel Project assets, including its interest in the Flying B Ranch #1 well and the 40 acre unit surrounding the well, for consideration of $415,000, and additionally, Wolfbone caused to be cancelled a total of 2,780,000 warrants to purchase our common stock, including 1,500,000 warrants held by McCabe Petroleum Corporation, an entity owned by Mr. McCabe, and 1,280,000 warrants held by Green Hill Minerals, an entity owned by Mr. McCabe’s son, which warrant cancellations were effected through certain Warrant Cancellation Agreements. The 1,500,000 warrants held by McCabe Petroleum Corporation had an exercise price of $1.00 per share and an expiration date of April 4, 2021. The warrants held by Green Hill Minerals included 100,000 warrants with an exercise price of $1.73 and an expiration date of September 30, 2018 and 1,180,000 warrants with an exercise price of $0.70 and an expiration date of February 15, 2020.
  
 Since Mr. McCabe held the controlling interest in both Line Drive and Wolfbone Investments, LLC, the transactions were combined for accounting purposes. The working interest in the Hazel Project was the only asset held by Line Drive. The warrant cancellation was treated in the aggregate as an exercise of the warrants with the transfer of the working interests as the consideration. The Company recorded the transactions as an increase in its investment in the Hazel project working interests of $3,644,431 which is equal to the exercise price of the warrants plus the cash paid to Wolfbone.
  
 Upon the closing of the transactions, the Company’s working interest in the Hazel project increased by 40.66% to a total ownership of 74%.
  
 Effective June 1, 2017, the Company acquired an additional 6% working interest from unrelated working interest owners in exchange for 268,656 shares of common stock valued at $373,430, increasing its working interest in the Hazel project to 80%.
  
  Winkler Project, Winkler County, Texas
  
 On December 1, 2017, the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization that we and our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Torchlight Wolfbone Properties, Inc., a Texas corporation (“TWP”), entered into with McCabe Petroleum Corporation, a Texas corporation (“MPC”), and Warwink Properties, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Warwink Properties”) closed. Under the agreement, which was entered into on November 14, 2017, TWP merged with and into Warwink Properties and the separate existence of TWP ceased, with Warwink Properties becoming the surviving organization and our wholly-owned subsidiary. Warwink Properties was wholly owned by MPC which is wholly owned by Gregory McCabe, our Chairman. Warwink Properties owns certain assets, including a 10.71875% working interest in 640 acres in Winkler County, Texas. At closing of the merger transaction, our shares of common stock of TWP converted into a membership interest of Warwink Properties, the membership interest in Warwink Properties held by MPC ceased to exist, and we issued MPC 2,500,000 restricted shares of common stock as consideration. Also on December 1, 2017, MPC closed its transaction with MECO IV, LLC (“MECO”) for the purchase and sale of certain assets as contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated November 9, 2017 (the “MECO PSA”), to which we are not a party. Under the MECO PSA, Warwink Properties received a carry from MECO (through the tanks) of up to $1,475,000 in the next well drilled on the Winkler County leases. A Certificate of Merger for the merger transaction was filed with the Secretary of State of Texas on December 5, 2017.
  
 Also on December 1, 2017, the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement that our wholly-owned subsidiary, Torchlight Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“TEI”), entered into with MPC closed. Under the Purchase Agreement, which was entered into on November 14, 2017, TEI acquired beneficial ownership of certain of MPC’s assets, including acreage and wellbores located in Ward County, Texas (the “Ward County Assets”). As consideration under the Purchase Agreement, at closing TEI issued to MPC an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $3,250,000, payable in monthly installments of interest only beginning on January 1, 2018, at the rate of 5% per annum, with the entire principal amount together with all accrued interest due and payable on December 31, 2020. In connection with TEI’s acquisition of beneficial ownership in the Ward County Assets, MPC sold those same assets, on behalf of TEI, to MECO at closing of the MECO PSA, and accordingly, TEI received $3,250,000 in cash for its beneficial interest in the Ward County Assets. Additionally, at closing of the MECO PSA, MPC paid TEI a performance fee of $2,781,500 in cash as compensation for TEI’s marketing and selling the Winkler County assets of MPC and the Ward County Assets as a package to MECO.

  Hunton Play, Central Oklahoma
  
  As of December 31, 2017, we were producing from one well in the Viking AMI, and one well in Prairie Grove.
  
  Legal Proceeding
  
  In May, 2016, Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. and its subsidiary Torchlight Energy, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the 429th judicial district court in Collin County, Texas against Husky Ventures, Inc., Charles V. Long, April Glidewell, Silverstar of Nevada, Inc., Maximus Exploration, LLC, Atwood Acquisitions, LLC, Gastar Exploration Inc., J. Russell Porter, Michael A. Gerlich, Jerry R. Schuyler, and John M. Selser, Sr. Reference is made to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” for more information regarding this lawsuit.
  
  Viking AMI
  
  In the fourth quarter of 2013 we entered into an Area of Mutual Interest (AMI) with Husky Ventures, the Viking Prospect. We acquired a 25% interest in 3,945 acres and subsequently acquired an additional 5% in May, 2014. We had an interest in 8,800 total acres as of December 31, 2016. (Net undeveloped acres = 2,600 Our net cumulative investment through December 31, 2016 in undeveloped acres in the Viking AMI was $1,387,928. In addition the company incurred $133,468 as its share of costs related to the early stages of the construction of a gas pipeline which was to serve the Viking AMI. As of December 31, 2017, to the best knowledge of the Company, substantially all of the leases have expired (although some may have been renewed without notice to Torchlight) and the leases remain subject to settlement negotiations in the legal action referenced above.
  
  Rosedale AMI
  
  In January of 2014 we contracted for a 25% Working Interest in approximately 5,000 acres in the Rosedale AMI consisting of eight townships in South Central Oklahoma. We subsequently acquired an additional 5% in May, 2014. The Company had an interest in 11,600 total acres as of December 31, 2016 (Net undeveloped acres = 3,500) Our cumulative investment through December 31, 2016 in the Rosedale AMI was $2,833,744. As of December 31, 2017, to the best knowledge of the Company, substantially all of the leases have expired (although some may have been renewed without notice to Torchlight) and the leases remain subject to settlement negotiations in the legal action referenced above.
  
  Prairie Grove – Judy Well
  
  In February of 2014, we acquired a 10% Working Interest in a well in the Prairie Grove AMI from a non-consenting third party who elected not to participate in the well. The well is producing at December 31, 2017.
  
  Thunderbird AMI
  
  In July of 2014, we contracted for a 25% Working Interest in the Thunderbird AMI. The total acres in which the Company has an interest at December 31, 2016 was 4,300 acres (Net undeveloped acres = 1,100). Our cumulative investment through December 31, 2016 in the Thunderbird AMI was $949,530. As of December 31, 2017, to the best knowledge of the Company, substantially all of the leases have expired (although some may have been renewed without notice to Torchlight) and the leases remain subject to settlement negotiations in the legal action referenced above.
  
  Industry and Business Environment
  
  We are experiencing a time of fluctuating oil prices caused by lower demand, higher US Supply, and OPEC’s policies on production. Unfortunately, this is the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry. We experience highs and lows that seem to come in cycles. Fortunately, advances in technology drive the US market and we feel this will drive the development costs down on our exploration and drilling programs.
 Competition
  
  The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we will compete with numerous other companies engaged in the exploration and production of oil and gas. Some of these companies have substantially greater resources than we have. Not only do they explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also many carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national, or worldwide basis. The operations of other companies may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties. They may also have more resources to define, evaluate, bid for, and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit.

  ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued
 
  Our larger or integrated competitors may have the resources to be better able to absorb the burden of current and future federal, state, and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to locate reserves and acquire interests in properties in the future will be dependent upon our ability and resources to evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. In addition, we may be at a disadvantage in producing oil and natural gas properties and bidding for exploratory prospects because we have fewer financial and human resources than other companies in our industry. Should a larger and better financed company decide to directly compete with us, and be successful in its efforts, our business could be adversely affected.
 Marketing and Customers
  
  The market for oil and natural gas that we will produce depends on factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas, the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, demand for oil and natural gas, the marketing of competitive fuels, and the effects of state and federal regulation. The oil and gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.
  
  Our oil production is expected to be sold at prices tied to the spot oil markets. Our natural gas production is expected to be sold under short-term contracts and priced based on first of the month index prices or on daily spot market prices. We will rely on our operating partners to market and sell our production.
  
  Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
  
  Our operations are subject to various rules, regulations, and limitations impacting the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry as a whole.
  
  Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Production
  
  Our oil and natural gas exploration, production, and related operations, when developed, will be subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state, tribal, and local authorities and agencies. Certain states may also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells, and the regulation of spacing, plugging, and abandonment of such wells. Failure to comply with any such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry will most likely increase our cost of doing business and may affect our profitability. Although we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. Significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 Environmental Matters
  
  Our operations and properties are and will be subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation, and discharge of materials into the environment, and relating to safety and health. In the future, environmental legislation and regulation may trend toward stricter standards. These laws and regulations may:
  
  · require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities;
   · limit or prohibit construction, drilling, and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness and other protected areas;
   · impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations; or
   · restrict certain areas from fracking and other stimulation techniques.
  
  The permits required for our operations may be subject to revocation, modification, and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce their regulations, and violations are subject to fines or injunctions, or both. In the opinion of management, we are and will be in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations, and have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in interpretations thereof could have a significant impact on our company, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general.
  
  The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and comparable state statutes impose strict, joint, and several liability on owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of “hazardous substances” found at such sites. It is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of “solid waste” and “hazardous waste” and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from its definition of “hazardous substance,” state laws affecting our operations may impose clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum related products. In addition, although RCRA classifies certain oil field wastes as “non-hazardous,” such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes thereby making such wastes subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements.

 ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued
  
  The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) seeks to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animal, fish, and plant species, nor destroy or modify the critical habitat of such species. Under ESA, exploration and production operations, as well as actions by federal agencies, may not significantly impair or jeopardize the species or its habitat. ESA provides for criminal penalties for willful violations of the Act. Other statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and that may apply to our operations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. Although we believe that our operations will be in substantial compliance with such statutes, any change in these statutes or any reclassification of a species as endangered could subject our company to significant expenses to modify our operations or could force our company to discontinue certain operations altogether.
  
 Hydraulic fracturing is regulated by state and federal oil and gas regulatory authorities, including specifically the requirement to disclose certain information related to hydraulic fracturing operations. Operators must follow applicable legal requirements for groundwater protection in our operations that are subject to supervision by state and federal regulators (including the Bureau of Land Management on federal acreage). Furthermore, well construction practices require the installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers by preventing the migration of fracturing fluids into aquifers. Regulatory proposals in some states and local communities have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. Federal and state agencies have continued to assess the impacts of hydraulic fracturing, which could spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities. In addition, in light of concerns about seismic activity being triggered by the injection of produced waters into underground wells and hydraulic fracturing, certain regulators are also considering additional requirements related to seismic safety for hydraulic fracturing activities. Further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could make it prohibitive to conduct our operations, and also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we or our operators are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities from our properties.
  
  Climate Change
  
  Significant studies and research have been devoted to climate change and global warming, and climate change has developed into a major political issue in the United States and globally. Certain research suggests that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change and pose a threat to the environment. Recent scientific research and political debate has focused in part on carbon dioxide and methane incidental to oil and natural gas exploration and production. Many states and the federal government have enacted legislation directed at controlling greenhouse gas emissions, and future legislation and regulation could impose additional restrictions or requirements in connection with our drilling and production activities and favor use of alternative energy sources, which could affect operating costs and demand for oil products. As such, our business could be materially adversely affected by domestic and international legislation targeted at controlling climate change.
 Employees
  
  We currently have four full time employees and no part time employees. We anticipate adding additional employees, when adequate funds are available, and using independent contractors, consultants, attorneys, and accountants as necessary to complement services rendered by our employees. We presently have independent technical professionals under consulting agreements who are available to us on an as needed basis.
 Research and Development
  
  We did not spend any funds on research and development activities during years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016.
