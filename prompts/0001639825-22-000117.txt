Item 1. Business
Overview
Peloton is the largest interactive fitness platform in the world with a loyal community of over 6.9 million Members as of June 30, 2022. We pioneered connected, technology-enabled fitness, and the streaming of immersive, instructor-led boutique classes to our Members anytime, anywhere. We make fitness entertaining, approachable, effective, and convenient, while fostering social connections that encourage our Members to be the best versions of themselves. We define a Member as any individual who has a Peloton account through a paid Connected Fitness Subscription (“All-Access Membership”), or a paid Peloton App subscription. 
We are an innovation company at the nexus of fitness, technology, and media. We have disrupted the fitness industry by developing a first-of-its-kind subscription platform that seamlessly combines the best equipment, proprietary networked software, and world-class streaming digital fitness and wellness content, creating a product that our Members love. 
Our world-class instructors teach classes across a variety of fitness and wellness disciplines, including indoor cycling, indoor/outdoor running and walking, Bike and Tread bootcamps, yoga, Pilates, Barre, strength training, stretching, meditation, and floor cardio. We produce hundreds of original programs per month and maintain a vast and constantly updated library of thousands of original fitness and wellness programs. We make it easy for Members to find a class that fits their interests based on class type, instructor, music genre, length, available equipment, area of physical focus, and level of difficulty.
Our Connected Fitness Product portfolio includes the Peloton Bike, Bike+, Tread, Tread+, and our recently launched first connected strength product, Peloton Guide. Our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of our Connected Fitness Products and associated recurring Subscription revenue. We have historically experienced significant growth in sales of our Connected Fitness Products, which, when combined with our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn has led to significant growth in Connected Fitness Subscriptions. From the start of fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2022 year-end, Total revenue decreased 11%, and our Connected Fitness Subscription base grew 27%.
Our financial profile has been characterized by strong retention, recurring revenue, and efficient customer acquisition. Our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, together with our high Subscription Contribution Margin, yields an attractive lifetime value (LTV) for our Connected Fitness subscriptions well in excess of our customer acquisition cost (CAC). Maintaining an attractive LTV/CAC ratio is a primary goal of our acquisition strategy.
Our Products
Connected Fitness Products
Bike
Our current Bike features a carbon steel frame, a nearly silent belt drive, durable magnetic resistance, and a 22” high-definition touchscreen with built-in stereo speakers to stream live and on-demand classes, all in a compact, 4’ by 2’ footprint. Our Bike is available in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia. 
Bike+ 
Our Bike+ provides an immersive cardio experience and seamless transition to floor-based exercises with its 24”, 360 degree rotating display. Members can easily pivot and tilt the screen to add strength, yoga, and stretching to their routine or take our Bike bootcamp class series. Resistance on Bike+ is controlled digitally allowing Members to “Auto Follow” their instructors’ class programs and control resistance from the touchscreen. A powerful built-in soundbar and subwoofer system offers an improved audio experience while the integrated Apple GymKit simplifies Apple Watch pairing. Bike+ is currently available for purchase in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia.
Tread
The newest addition to our Tread line has all the essential elements of the Tread+ experience but in a more affordable and compact form factor – maintaining ample running surface area and runner comfort. The Tread features a sleek belt drive, 24” touchscreen with integrated soundbar and subwoofer, and ergonomic pace and incline control knobs and jump buttons. With an immersive audio and video experience and heart rate monitor integration, Peloton Tread is designed for both on-Tread as well as floor-based bootcamp content. Tread is currently available for purchase in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany.
Tread+
Tread+ features a shock-absorbing rubber-slat belt and ball bearing system, ideal for low-impact training. Pace and incline ergonomic control knobs allow for seamless adjustments, and the 32” high-definition touchscreen features a 20-watt sound bar. Tread+ had only been available for sale in the United States, however, on May 5, 2021, we decided to issue a voluntary product recall on Tread+, which we are conducting in collaboration with the Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC"). At this time, we are not able to forecast a date for sales to resume in the United States. See Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Connected Fitness Products and Members.”
Guide
Guide is our first connected fitness strength product designed to further enhance the full-body workout experience through a number of unique product features. Guide is supported with dedicated content, including exclusive programs for all levels, live body-training classes with instructors, and an extensive move library to help Members learn and perfect proper form. Guide is currently available for purchase in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia.
Subscriptions
Connected Fitness Subscriptions
Our Connected Fitness Subscriptions are on a month-to-month basis, allow for multiple household users, and provide unlimited access to all live and on-demand classes. Our Connected Fitness Subscription allows Members to access classes through our Connected Fitness Products, compete on our motivating leaderboard, track performance metrics, and connect and interact with the broader Peloton community. Our Connected Fitness Subscription also includes access to our content through Peloton Digital, our digital app, which is available through iOS and Android mobile devices and most tablets and computers. On average, we had 2.1 Members per Connected Fitness Subscription as of June 30, 2022.
Peloton Digital
Peloton Digital began as a companion app for Connected Fitness Subscriptions to provide access to our classes while our Members were away from their Connected Fitness Products. A Peloton Digital Subscriber is an individual who has a paid Peloton Digital subscription with a successful credit card billing. 
Peloton Digital is included with all Connected Fitness Subscriptions. As of June 30, 2022, 71% of our Members on Connected Fitness Subscriptions used Peloton Digital to supplement their workout regimen. Peloton Digital also helps us attract new Connected Fitness Subscriptions by serving as an acquisition tool for new Members.
Peloton Digital workouts include indoor/outdoor running and walking, Bike and Tread bootcamps, yoga, Pilates, Barre, strength training, stretching, meditation, and floor cardio. Our Members have shown strong interest in these new verticals; in fiscal 2022, 56% of workouts completed were across non-cycling fitness verticals. 
Our Integrated Fitness Platform
Technology
Our content delivery and interactive software platform are critical to our Member experience. We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our platform, develop new products and features, and improve the speed, scalability, and security of our platform infrastructure. Our research and development organization consists of world-class engineering, product, and design teams. Our engineering, product, and design teams work together to bring our products to life, from conception and validation to implementation. We constantly improve our existing Connected Fitness Products through frequent software updates, rapid iteration of feature enhancements, and new innovations. 
Our video streaming pipeline utilizes cloud providers for stream generation, storage, and distribution. The integration with these providers is customized and developed by our engineering team and is designed to integrate with our product and systems. This enables a high-quality Member experience and high availability of services across diverse consumer platforms and geographies.
Content and Music
We create engaging, original fitness and wellness content in an authentic live environment that is immersive and motivating while encouraging a sense of community. We combine high production value content with a broad catalog of music to create a truly unique fitness experience our Members love.
We use performance data to understand our Members’ workout habits in order to evolve and optimize our programming around class type, length, music, and other considerations. We have developed a diverse content library with thousands of classes across an extensive range of class lengths, difficulty levels, and fitness preferences ranging from fun and flexible to structured and highly technical, all of which our Members easily access through filtering and search capabilities. As of June 30, 2022, we produce original programs from our production studios in New York City and London, with 54 instructors, and across 14 fitness and wellness disciplines including indoor Cycling, Tread, Outdoor Running and Walking, Bike and Tread bootcamps, Yoga, Strength Training, Pilates, Barre, Stretching, Meditation, Floor Cardio, and Dance Cardio. We have additionally updated our Scenic Content to include instructor-guided content shot in beautiful locations with multi-channel Scenic Radio options, as well as Lanebreak, a gamified workout feature that allows members to experience an animated workout as an alternative to original programming.
As we further expand internationally, we intend to develop localized content, as we have done in the United Kingdom and Germany. As we expand into other non-English-speaking countries, we intend to produce classes in local languages from our existing studios and use subtitling for English-speaking users. We currently produce our content in three languages: English, German, and Spanish.
Instructors
In front of the camera, our instructors play a critical role in bringing the Peloton experience to life for our Members. Our instructors are not only authorities in their respective areas of fitness, but also relatable, magnetic personalities who inspire passionate followings. We offer a diverse cast of instructors that allows us to appeal to a broad audience of Members. Our instructors inspire our Members off-camera by attending showroom openings and other Member-focused events, like Homecoming, where they meet and interact with our Members. Our Members feel connected to our instructors and many Members travel long distances to take a live class at our Peloton studios.
Production Team
Behind the camera, our studio production teams are dedicated to creative excellence. We have top production talent representing decades of experience at major broadcast and cable networks, some of whom have won Emmy Awards for production excellence. Our teams provide dedicated creative support to our instructors before, during, and after live productions with the help of content performance data. All classes are shot in broadcast quality environments with a fraction of the staff and budget typical of a major network show. This allows us to deliver a constant stream of live-produced, authentic fitness and wellness programming with cinematic quality that provides clarity of instruction and entertainment value.
Music and Music Technology
We have developed a proprietary music platform that fuels the workout experience allowing our instructors to program curated playlists that align with our Members’ musical preferences. As of June 30, 2022, we had over 4 million active tracks under license, representing one of the largest audiovisual connected fitness music catalogs in the world. Our curated music is as diverse and dynamic as the Members we serve, delivering an exceptional musical experience created by instructors and music supervisors on our production team.
We control the intersection of fitness and music in a deeply engaging way, motivating Members to achieve their fitness goals while discovering great music in the process. Peloton has become noteworthy as a music-forward brand and discovery platform for new artists and songs while also providing the opportunity for our Members to engage in a new way to the music they love. Members consistently rank music as one of their favorite aspects of the Peloton experience. We believe we have taken a leading position in the fitness and wellness category by defining new standards for musical content partnership campaigns that feature some of the most recognizable global talent in the industry. This also includes the development of our signature Artist Series which celebrate the legacy and catalog of some of the most prominent names in the business. We premiere new music exclusives available only on Peloton, and collaborate closely with artist teams across a variety of productions including remixes, curation, custom content, and guest platform appearances, all based on their own music or influences.
We have applied, and will continue to apply, technological solutions and an artist-centric partnership strategy to enhance our music platform including:
•Development of data-driven playlist recommendations for our instructors and music supervisors to use in programming;
•Song search and filtering optimizations, including the ability to search by song length and beats per minute;
•Automation of music rights management and reporting;
•For Members, a display of every song played in a class, including artist name and associated artwork;
•Ability for Members to “like” songs they discover anywhere on our platform and save it to their profile;
•Spotify and Apple Music integrations, enabling Members to sync songs they hear on Peloton to their streaming service; and
•Strengthening and leveraging artist partnerships on and off-platform for deeper membership engagement and heightened brand profile.
Music Rights Strategy
We have built a world class music rights content management and reporting system to meet the needs of our music rights holders in order to support our highly-engaged, growing global community. Peloton is increasingly seen by our partners as an impactful music discovery platform, which has created opportunities to progressively and meaningfully enhance our classes with custom music experiences. We expect this to continue as we invest in music-first technology to improve the quality of our Members’ experience, strengthen our competitive advantage over other fitness platforms, and add value to our Members.
Sales and Marketing
Our goal is to increase brand awareness and purchase intent for our Connected Fitness Products and Subscriptions. We use a unique combination of brand and product-specific performance marketing to build brand awareness and generate predictable sales of our Connected Fitness Products. 
Video has been the strongest medium to communicate the features of the Peloton platform. We primarily market through advertisements on broadcast and cable television, social media, and over-the-top providers such as Hulu and YouTube to reach our target audience, focusing on incremental return on investment.
Direct to Consumer, Multi-Channel Sales Model
We sell our products directly to customers through a multi-channel sales platform that includes e-commerce, inside sales, showrooms, and in a small number of cases, a "store within store" concept. Our sales associates use robust customer relationship management tools to deliver an elevated, personalized, and educational purchase experience, regardless of channel of capture and conversion.
•E-Commerce and Inside Sales: Our desktop and mobile websites, www.onepeloton.com, www.onepeloton.co.uk, www.onepeloton.de, www.onepeloton.ca, and www.onepeloton.com.au provide an elevated brand experience where visitors can learn about our products and services and access product reviews. Our inside sales team engages with customers by phone, email, and online chat on our websites, and offers one-on-one sales consultations seven days a week.
•Showrooms: Our showrooms allow customers to experience and try our products. We provide interactive product demonstrations and many of our showrooms have private areas where customers can do a “test ride” or “test run.” We frequently host Peloton community events in our showrooms, which help deepen brand engagement and loyalty. 
•Commercial: The commercial and hospitality markets represent a small percentage of sales but are important to driving trial and brand awareness. Our Bikes in hospitality locations help keep our Members riding when they travel, creating further Member engagement, loyalty, and convenience. Across our markets as of June 30, 2022, there were approximately 18,000 Peloton Bikes in over 8,000 commercial locations.
•Corporate Wellness: Our Corporate Wellness program provides employers, insurers, and other partners with the opportunity to offer their employees and Members subsidized access to Peloton Digital subscriptions, All Access Memberships, and/or Connected Fitness Products and delivers on our oft-stated goal to make Peloton even more accessible.
Additionally, with our announcement in August 2022 that Peloton Bike, Guide, and select accessories and apparel are available for purchase in Amazon's U.S. stores, we have begun and expect to continue to broaden our sales channels, including through distribution to third-party retailers.
Showroom Sites
As of June 30, 2022, we operated 135 retail locations across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany. Our retail locations are located primarily in upscale malls, lifestyle centers, and premium street locations. When evaluating potential new markets, we carefully examine historical sales data, key demographics, traffic patterns, geographic locations, and co-tenancy of other complementary lifestyle-oriented retailers. In the United States, we attempt to cluster stores around major urban markets and suburbs while also operating in super regional and regional centers that draw from a greater trade area. In Canada, Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom, we will continue to focus on major urban markets.
We operate three retail formats including our large showrooms which range from 1,500 to 3,000 square feet and “microstores” which are typically around 300 square feet. Large showrooms comprise 75% of our retail locations and provide space for Connected Fitness Products and Peloton-branded apparel, as well as private areas for “test rides” and “test runs.” Microstores represent 5% of our retail locations and are typically placed in highly visible “center court” areas. Concession stores represent 20% of our retail locations and consist of a presence within a partner's retail space in the U.K., Australia, and Germany. Our large showroom leases are typically five to ten years in lease duration while microstores are typically open for up to 1.5 years. Microstores allow us to test markets and specific shopping areas, and provide a temporary location while searching for the ideal large showroom space.
On August 12, 2022, as part of our previously announced ongoing restructuring initiatives, we announced the decision to rebalance our e-commerce and retail mix to drive efficiencies and therefore reduce our retail showroom presence across North America. 
Membership & Member Support Services
The Membership team, which includes third-party support providers, is focused on driving engagement to help us maintain our high Connected Fitness Subscription retention rates. The team develops new ways to promote engagement with our products and community or help Members reengage with our platform when activity has lapsed. The Membership team helps curate goal-based challenges, awards digital badges for Member accomplishments, and sends Peloton-branded “Century Club” shirts after a Member’s 100th class. The team also communicates with Members with no recent activity through email campaigns that help encourage these Members to get back to their workout routine. In addition, the Membership team collects and responds to feedback about our platform that is on our primary Facebook group of over 469,000 Members as of June 30, 2022.
In order to bring our community together, we organize several in-person events throughout the year including to welcome Members for workouts, celebrate milestones, and attend instructor meet-and-greets at our production studios in New York City and London. We also host Members at our showrooms, and celebrate our Members with our flagship Member event, Peloton Homecoming, held in New York City and remotely each May. While all in-person events were cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic, we re-opened our Peloton Studios in New York to the public in July 2022 and have resumed some in-person events. 
The Member Support team, along with our third-party support providers, serves all the needs of our customers and Members including sales support, scheduling, delivery, installation, account and billing inquiries, product trouble-shooting and repair, product education, returns and exchanges, and anything else our Members need.
Manufacturing and Logistics
We have historically manufactured and assembled our products in-house, as well as through third parties, and in July 2022, we announced a shift to utilizing third-party manufacturing partners for 100% of our products. The components used in our products are procured on our behalf using our designs by our contract manufacturers, according to our required design specifications and high 
standards, from a variety of suppliers. In order to account for technology evolution and market fluctuations, we regularly review our relationships with our existing contract manufacturers and the components suppliers that they contract with, while evaluating prospective new partnerships.
We purchase from our primary contract manufacturers on a purchase order basis. Under our governing agreements, our contract manufacturers must follow our established product design specifications, quality assurance programs, and manufacturing standards. We have developed relationships with our partners to maintain access to the resources needed to scale seasonally and ensure our partners have the requisite experience to produce our Connected Fitness Products and accessories. We pay for and own certain tooling and equipment specifically required to manufacture our products to have control of supply and component pipelines. 
In an attempt to mitigate against the risks related to a single source of supply, we qualify alternative suppliers and manufacturers when possible, and develop contingency plans for responding to disruptions, such as maintaining buffer inventory of single source components or utilizing alternative freight lanes that can have cost implications. However, given the current global supply and freight constraints, or natural disasters, we face challenges with various manufacturing related component shortages.
Logistics and Fulfillment
Historically, we have used a combination of contracted third-party logistics providers (“3PLs”) and owned assets in our logistics network which includes middle mile and last mile operations centers in the United States, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom. In the Australian market, we have utilized contracted services for the entire logistics network.
We are moving towards exclusively utilizing 3PL partners for our last mile network in North America and are actively exploring similar transitions to a more variable network in our international markets. This shift in logistics strategy is meant to allow us to further scale our delivery capabilities and to drive improvements in speed of service, cost and geographical reach, all while maintaining flexibility. We seek out 3PL partners who are highly-trained experts on our products and services and offer product education, assistance with account set up, tips and recommendations for product care as well as content selection.
With our commitment to our Members-first approach, we will continue to invest to strengthen our field operations’ coverage, and improved delivery experience and service.
Intellectual Property
The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We rely upon a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, and other legal rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements and invention or work product assignment agreements with our employees and consultants to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information.
As of June 30, 2022, we held 158 U.S. issued patents and had 72 U.S. patent applications pending. We also held 259 issued patents in foreign jurisdictions and 206 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. Our U.S. issued patents expire between May 9, 2023 and November 24, 2040. As of June 30, 2022, we held 41 registered trademarks in the United States, including the Peloton mark and our “P” logo and also held 566 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology.
Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.
Competition
We believe that our first-mover advantage, leading market position, brand recognition, and integrated platform set us apart in the market for connected, technology-enabled fitness. We provide a superior value proposition and benefit from the clear endorsement of our Connected Fitness Subscription and mobile app solutions, giving us a competitive advantage versus traditional fitness and wellness products and services, and future potential entrants.
While we believe we are changing the consumption patterns for fitness and growing the market, our main sources of competition include in-studio fitness classes, fitness clubs, at-home fitness equipment and content, and health and wellness apps.
The areas in which we compete include:
•Consumers and Engagement. We compete for consumers to join our platform through Connected Fitness Subscriptions or Peloton Digital subscriptions, and we seek to engage and retain them through an integrated experience that combines content, software, service, and community.
•Product Offering. We compete with producers of fitness products and services and work to ensure that our platform maintains the most innovative technology and user-friendly features.
•Talent. We compete for talent in every vertical across our company including technology, media, fitness, design, supply chain, logistics, music, marketing, finance, strategy, legal, and retail. As our platform is highly dependent on technology, hardware, and software, we require a significant base of engineers to continue innovating.
The principal competitive factors that companies in our industry need to consider include, but are not limited to: total cost, supply chain efficiency across sourcing and procurement, manufacturing and logistics, enhanced products and services, original content, product quality and safety, competitive pricing policies, vision for the market and product innovation, strength of sales and marketing strategies, technological advances, and brand awareness and reputation. We believe we compete favorably across all of these factors and we have developed a business model that is difficult to replicate.
Government Regulation
We are subject to many varying laws and regulations in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and throughout the world, including those related to privacy, data protection, content regulation, intellectual property, consumer protection, e-commerce, marketing, advertising, messaging, rights of publicity, health and safety, employment and labor, product quality and safety, accessibility, competition, customs and international trade, and taxation. These laws often require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of information, such as personal data, “special categories of personal data” or health data. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended in a manner that could harm our current or future business and operations. In addition, it is possible that certain governments may seek to block or limit our products and services or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of any or all of our products and services for an extended period of time or indefinitely.
Seasonality
Historically, we have experienced higher revenue in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year compared to other quarters, due in large part to seasonal holiday demand, New Year’s resolutions, and cold weather. We also have historically incurred higher sales and marketing expenses during these periods. For example, in fiscal 2018 and 2019, our second and third quarters combined each represented 63% of our Total revenue for the applicable fiscal year. However, in fiscal 2020, we saw a significant increase in demand in the fourth quarter related to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in contrast to previous years, only 54% of our Total revenue was generated in our second and third quarters. In fiscal 2021, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the recalls of our Tread products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 continued to impact our historical seasonal patterns, with the second and third fiscal quarters accounting for only 58% of our fiscal 2021 sales (excluding Precor sales as Precor was consolidated beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021). In fiscal 2022, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the recalls of our Tread products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 impacted our historical seasonal patterns, with the second and third fiscal quarters accounting for 59% of fiscal 2022 sales. As the pandemic receded in recent months, we began to experience a return to pre-pandemic seasonal trends. However, should the COVID-19 pandemic worsen or if its effects prove to be prolonged, we may continue to see atypical seasonal trends.
Human Capital 
Our Culture
Our dynamic culture expresses our expansive vision and passion for community and collaboration, and is shaped by the following fundamental values:
•Put Members First: We obsess over every touchpoint of our Member experience - always remembering that when our Members win, we win. We root everything we do and all product and feature development in Member needs and never assume we know what is best. We believe in building connections based on trust, respect, and inclusion, and are proud that our Member community embodies these qualities. 
•Operate with a Bias for Action: We challenge the status quo by continuously innovating, learning, and improving. We embrace failure and change as an opportunity to be agile, take smart risks, and learn - and we also take the time to pause in order to act and move forward with sharper focus and intent. We never let the fear of imperfection stop us from achieving great things.
•Empower Teams of Smart Creatives: We hire team members who are great at what they do, then give them the trust, autonomy, and resources to do their jobs and make decisions. We empower one another to embrace a creative mindset and be creative in execution, problem-solving, thinking beyond parameters, and delivery. We take the time to show appreciation and celebrate the achievements of our team members. 
•Together We Go Far: As our company name suggests, we know the importance and value of a team. Work shoulder-to-shoulder and have each other’s backs, encourage everyone to have a voice, and draw out the best in others. We uphold the obligation to dissent rather and are open to perspectives different from our own.
•Be the Best Place to Work: We are committed to cultivating and maintaining our authentic, world-class culture across all our markets – putting team member experience, well-being, and safety at the heart of all that we do. We strive to show up with empathy, honesty, and authenticity and are committed to maintain and build on this aspect of our culture as we grow and scale.
We live these values through our approach to human capital management, summarized below.
Employees
As of June 30, 2022, we employed 3,723 individuals in the United States across our New York City headquarters, Plano campus, Atlanta office, showrooms, and field operations warehouses, with 3,576 being full-time employees. Internationally, we had 857 employees in the 
United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, and Australia across corporate, showroom, and warehouse functions, 86 employees in Canada, largely in showroom and warehouse roles, and 738 individuals in Taiwan across manufacturing, quality engineering and operations functions. Additionally, Precor's 791 employees are located across 13 countries, with most based in manufacturing facilities in North Carolina and Washington state. We also hire additional seasonal employees, primarily in our showrooms, during the holiday season.
In July 2022, we announced we are exiting all owned-manufacturing, which involves the reduction in our workforce of approximately 500 employees in Taiwan. Additionally, in connection with our previously announced ongoing restructuring initiatives, in August 2022, we announced our plans for a reduction in our workforce of approximately 530 employees from our North American delivery workforce teams, as well as approximately 250 Member support positions in North America.
Certain of our instructors are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, or SAG-AFTRA. However, we are not signatories to any agreements with SAG-AFTRA. With the exception of SAG-AFTRA, none of our domestic employees are currently represented by a labor organization or a party to any collective bargaining agreements.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We are unapologetic about our bold and unrelenting commitment to creating workspaces that are equitable for all and where all team members can thrive, and where they are recognized for their individual and collective contributions to our business. 
Our diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) team operate as a center of excellence, partnering across the business and proactively using data, evidence and insights to inform our programming, ensuring it remains locally relevant and responsive.
We’re proud that one of our core tenets is to strive to operate as an antiracist organization, and in 2020, we committed ourselves to the Peloton Pledge, our ongoing multi-year, business wide commitment to combat systemic inequity and promote global health and well-being for all. Through the Peloton Pledge we are investing across five pillars:
•Our Workforce - We offer above-market entry rates for our hourly workforce;
•Learning and Development - We offer content that focuses on supporting the mobility of our team members and we are doubling down on training around DEI topics; 
•Community Investments - We partner with leaders and action-oriented nonprofits to drive change in the broader community
•Inclusive Content - We produce content and experiences that uplift diverse perspectives within our community; and
•Long-Term DEI - We invest in various programs to support long-term DEI, as further described below.
For our team members, the Peloton Pledge has meant an increased emphasis on delivery of value-added, business-wide DEI programming. In our ongoing push for business-wide shared learning, we continue to create psychologically safe spaces for our employees to learn and grow together. 
We offer development programs for all team members, including an online resource, the Antiracism Activation Center, to bolster their journey toward becoming an antiracist ally. In addition, we established a bronze-level baseline for the MLT Black Equity at Work Certification – a comprehensive process aimed at broad and long-term systemic change – and will strive to reach gold level in the coming years.
We have also introduced specific learning programs for managers, such as Prototyping Inclusion and Activating Allyship, to help our leaders support our DEI goals. We similarly host “Brave Conversations'” on race and equity that help us accelerate our path to becoming the Best Place to Work. 
When it comes to supporting our team members, we are proud to have eight U.S. and five International Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) that foster a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our ERGs amplify team member voice and help us foster belonging and engagement across all the markets we operate in:
•ACE@Peloton (Asian Community);
•Black@Peloton;
•LHIT@Peloton (Latinx/Hispanic in Tech);
•Peloton Pride + Allies;
•The Parenthood Journey; 
•The Women’s Alliance;
•Veterans@Peloton; and
•Thrive (mental health, neurodiversity, and disability).

To hold ourselves accountable on pay equity, we conduct an annual third-party analysis of team members’ pay to evaluate the impact, if any, of gender, race, or ethnicity on base pay independent of business relevant factors. The pay equity study conducted in April 2022 identified no statistically significant pay gaps based on gender, race, or ethnicity, and any identified pay gaps (regardless if such gaps were statistically significant or not) have been adjusted to support our commitment to achieve true pay equity across Peloton. Our pay equity study is in addition to any market-specific obligations we have to undertake pay gap analyses, such as our Gender Pay Gap Study in the United Kingdom. Our bold, ambitious DEI efforts are designed to achieve equity, including pay equity, for all our team members and to ensure we’re a globally inclusive business. 
Employee Safety
We prioritize the health and welfare of our team members, our Members, and our environment. The core elements of our employee health and safety strategy include site risk analysis, incident management, documented processes, environmental programs, training, and occupational health programs. Our Global Safety & Security Operations team promotes safe operations and provides team members with access to our global 24/7 Risk Operations Center. Concerns about the health and safety of our employees, or the health and safety of individuals working on behalf of Peloton suppliers or business partners, are reportable through our Ethics Hotline or online Ethics Portal, which is monitored by our Compliance and Risk Team. We continually strive to improve processes across field safety training, incident training, professional investigations, and standardization of physical security resources, among other areas.
Training, Development, and Engagement
At Peloton, we have a dedicated global Learning and Development Team that develops and delivers company-wide training experiences across all functions. These include, but are not limited to:
