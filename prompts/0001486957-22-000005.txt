Item 1.    BUSINESS
General
BWX Technologies, Inc. is a specialty manufacturer of nuclear components, a developer of nuclear technologies and a service provider with an operating history of more than 100 years. Our core businesses focus on the design, engineering and manufacture of precision naval nuclear components, reactors and nuclear fuel for the U.S. Government. We also provide special nuclear materials processing, environmental site restoration services, products and services to customers in the nuclear power industry, critical medical radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals and other advanced nuclear technologies. While we provide a wide range of products and services, our business segments are heavily focused on major projects. At any given time, a relatively small number of projects can represent a significant part of our operations.
On June 30, 2015, we completed the spin-off of our former Power Generation business (the "spin-off") into an independent, publicly traded company named Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. ("BWE"). We have presented the notes to our consolidated financial statements on the basis of continuing operations, unless otherwise stated.
Business Segments
We operate in three reportable segments: Nuclear Operations Group, Nuclear Power Group and Nuclear Services Group. For financial information regarding each of our segments and financial information regarding geographic areas, see Note 15 and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report. For further details regarding each segment's facilities, see Item 2 of this Report. In general, we operate in capital-intensive industries and rely on large contracts for a substantial amount of our revenues. We are currently exploring growth strategies across our segments through strategic investments and acquisitions to expand and complement our existing businesses. We would expect to fund these opportunities with cash generated from operations or by raising additional capital through debt, equity or some combination thereof.
Nuclear Operations Group
Through this segment, we engineer, design and manufacture precision naval nuclear components, reactors and nuclear fuel for the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE")/National Nuclear Security Administration's ("NNSA") Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. In addition, we perform fabrication activities for missile launch tubes for U.S. Navy submarines.
Our Nuclear Operations Group segment specializes in the design and manufacture of close-tolerance and high-quality equipment for nuclear applications. In addition, we are a leading manufacturer of critical nuclear components, fuels and assemblies for government and limited other uses. We have supplied nuclear components for DOE programs since the 1950s and are the largest domestic supplier of research reactor fuel elements for colleges, universities and national laboratories. We also downblend Cold War-era government stockpiles of high-enriched uranium. In addition, we have over 100 years of experience in supplying components for defense applications.
We work closely with the DOE-supported nuclear non-proliferation program. Currently, this program is assisting in the development of a high-density, low-enriched uranium fuel required for high-enriched uranium test reactor conversions. We have also been a leader in the receipt, storage, characterization, dissolution, recovery and purification of a variety of uranium-bearing materials. All phases of uranium downblending and uranium recovery are performed at our Lynchburg, Virginia and Erwin, Tennessee sites.
The demand for nuclear components by the U.S. Government determines a substantial portion of this segment's backlog. We expect that orders for nuclear components will continue to be a significant part of backlog for the foreseeable future. In addition, the U.S. Navy issued its fiscal year 2022 long-range shipbuilding plan in June 2021, which maintains previous recommendations to increase the size of its fleet of ships to include additional submarines and aircraft carriers. While the current presidential administration may make further changes with its fiscal year 2023 budget submission, we have made 
additional capital expenditures and investments in personnel to meet this anticipated growth in demand and we expect to continue making such expenditures and investments.
Nuclear Power Group
Through this segment, we design and manufacture commercial nuclear steam generators, heat exchangers, pressure vessels, reactor components and other auxiliary equipment, including containers for the storage of spent nuclear fuel and other high-level nuclear waste. We have supplied the nuclear industry with more than 1,300 large, heavy components worldwide and we are the only commercial heavy nuclear component manufacturer in North America. This segment is also a leading supplier of nuclear fuel, fuel handling systems, tooling delivery systems, nuclear-grade materials and precisely machined components, and related services for CANDU nuclear power plants. This segment also provides a variety of engineering and in-plant services and is a significant supplier to nuclear power utilities undergoing major refurbishment and plant life extension projects. Our in-depth knowledge comes from over 50 years of experience in the design, manufacturing, commissioning and service of nuclear power generation equipment. Additionally, this segment is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of critical medical radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals.
The Nuclear Power Group segment specializes in performing full-scope, prototype design work coupled with manufacturing integration. This segment's capabilities include:
•steam generation and separation equipment design and development;
•thermal-hydraulic design of reactor plant components;

•material procurement of tubing, forgings and weld wire;
•metallographic and chemical analysis; and
•manufacture and supply of critical medical radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals for research, diagnostic and therapeutic uses.
Our Nuclear Power Group segment's overall activity primarily depends on the demand and competitiveness of nuclear energy. A significant portion of our Nuclear Power Group segment's operations depends on the timing of maintenance outages, principally in the Canadian market, and the cyclical nature of capital expenditures and major refurbishments for nuclear utility customers, which could cause variability in our financial results.
Nuclear Services Group
Through this segment, we provide various services to the U.S. Government, including special nuclear materials processing, environmental site restoration services and management and operating services for various U.S. Government-owned facilities. These services are provided primarily to the DOE, including the NNSA, the Office of Nuclear Energy, the Office of Science and the Office of Environmental Management, and NASA.
This segment's principal operations include:
•managing and operating environmental management sites;
•managing spent nuclear fuel and transuranic waste for the DOE;
•managing and operating nuclear production facilities;
•providing critical skills and resources for DOE sites; and
•managing and operating space flight hardware and test facilities for NASA.
This segment also develops technology for a variety of applications, including advanced nuclear power sources, and offers complete advanced nuclear fuel and reactor design and engineering, licensing and manufacturing services for new advanced nuclear reactors.
Our Nuclear Services Group segment's overall activity depends primarily on authorized spending levels of the DOE, including the NNSA, the Office of Nuclear Energy, the Office of Science and the Office of Environmental Management, and NASA. We manage and operate complex, high-consequence nuclear and national security operations for the DOE and the NNSA, primarily through our joint ventures, as further discussed under the caption "Joint Ventures" below.
Divestiture of U.S.-Based Commercial Nuclear Services Business
On May 29, 2020, our subsidiary BWXT Nuclear Energy, Inc. divested its U.S.-based commercial nuclear services business, a component of our Nuclear Services Group segment. In a cashless transaction, we exchanged net assets totaling $18.0 million, consisting primarily of property, plant and equipment and certain warranty obligations, for a manufacturing facility and the associated land of approximately the same value. The acquired assets are reported as part of the Nuclear Services Group segment.
Acquisitions
Laker Energy Products Ltd.
On January 2, 2020, our subsidiary BWXT Canada Ltd. acquired Laker Energy Products Ltd., which was renamed BWXT Precision Manufacturing Inc. ("Precision Manufacturing"). Precision Manufacturing is a global supplier of nuclear-grade materials and precisely machined components for CANDU nuclear power utilities and is reported as part of our Nuclear Power Group segment.
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report for additional information on acquisitions.
Contracts
We execute our contracts through a variety of methods, including fixed-price incentive fee, cost-plus, cost-reimbursable, firm fixed-price or some combination of these methods. We generally recognize our contract revenues and related costs on an over time basis. Accordingly, we review contract price and cost estimates regularly as the work progresses and reflect adjustments in profit proportionate to the percentage of completion in the period when we revise those estimates. To the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or an elimination of previously reported profits with respect to a project, we would recognize a charge against current earnings, which could be material.
We have contracts that extend beyond one year. Most of our long-term contracts have provisions for progress payments. We attempt to cover anticipated increases in labor, material and service costs of our long-term contracts either through an estimate of such changes, which is reflected in the original price, or through risk-sharing mechanisms, such as escalation or price adjustments for items such as labor and commodity prices.
In the event of a contract deferral or cancellation, we generally would be entitled to recover costs incurred, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to deferral or termination. Significant or numerous contract cancellations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Nuclear Operations Group
The majority of the revenue generated by this segment is from long-term contracts with the U.S. DOE/NNSA's Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. Unless otherwise specified in a contract, allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the U.S. Government in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (the "FAR") and the related U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards ("CAS"). Examples of costs that may be incurred by us and not billable to the U.S. Government in accordance with the requirements of the FAR and CAS regulations include, but are not limited to, unallowable employee compensation and benefit costs, lobbying costs, interest, certain legal costs and charitable donations.
Most of our contracts in this segment are fixed-price incentive fee contracts that provide for reimbursement of allowable costs incurred plus a fee and generally require that we use our best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and stated dollar limitation. Fees can be established in terms of dollar value or percentage of costs. Award and incentive fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of our performance against negotiated criteria, primarily 
related to cost, and are intended to provide motivation for excellence in contract performance. Incentive fees that are based on cost provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later, typically using a formula to measure performance against the associated criteria, based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs. Award and incentive fees represent variable consideration that we include in revenue when there is sufficient evidence to determine that the variable consideration is not constrained.
Certain of our U.S. Government contracts span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right not to exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period for various reasons including, but not limited to, annual funding determinations. In addition, contracts between the U.S. Government and its prime contractors usually contain standard provisions for termination at the convenience of the U.S. Government or the prime contractor. As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to federal regulations under which our right to receive future awards of new federal contracts would be unilaterally suspended or barred if we were convicted of a crime or indicted based on allegations of a violation of specific federal statutes. In addition, some of our contracts with the U.S. Government require us to provide advance notice in connection with any contemplated sale or shut down of the relevant facility. In each of those situations, the U.S. Government has an exclusive right to negotiate a mutually acceptable purchase of the facility.
Nuclear Power Group
Contracts in this segment are usually awarded through a competitive bid process. Factors that customers may consider include price, plant or equipment availability, technical capabilities of equipment and personnel, efficiency, safety record and reputation. Certain of these contracts are fixed-price contracts in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a pre-determined price that is generally not subject to adjustment, regardless of costs incurred by the contractor, unless changes in scope are authorized by the customer. Fixed-price contracts entail more risk to us because they require us to predetermine both the quantities of work to be performed and the costs associated with executing the work. Remaining contracts are primarily time-and-materials contracts, which result in us recovering costs incurred in accordance with the contract plus a fee.
Our arrangements with customers may require us to provide letters of credit, bid and performance bonds or guarantees to secure bids or performance under contracts, which may involve significant amounts for contract security.
Nuclear Services Group
This segment's principal operations include the management and operation of nuclear production facilities, environmental management sites and the management of spent nuclear fuel and transuranic waste for the DOE. These activities are primarily accomplished through our participation in joint ventures with other contractors as further discussed under the caption "Joint Ventures" below.
The contracts for the management and operation of U.S. Government facilities are awarded through a complex and protracted procurement process. These contracts are generally structured as five-year contracts with options for up to five additional years, which are exercisable by the customer, or include provisions whereby the contract durations can be extended as a result of the achievement of certain performance metrics. These are generally cost-reimbursement contracts that include an award fee that is primarily based on annual performance, with monthly provisional fee payments and annual true-up payments. Depending on the type of contract, the contractor may be required to supply working capital, which is reimbursed by the U.S. Government through regular invoicing.
This segment also serves customers of our advanced technology platforms primarily through the use of fixed-price contracts that are awarded following a competitive bid process. Fixed-price contracts entail more risk to us because the price has been pre-determined and is generally not subject to adjustment, regardless of costs incurred, unless authorized by the customer.
Backlog
Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenue we expect to recognize in the future from contracts awarded and in progress. Not all of our expected revenue from a contract award is recorded in backlog for a variety of reasons, including that some projects are awarded and completed within the same reporting period.
Our backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under contracts that meet the criteria in Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Topic Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report. It is possible that our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to methods used by other companies.
We are subject to the budgetary and appropriations cycle of the U.S. Government as it relates to our Nuclear Operations Group and Nuclear Services Group segments. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results, and projects in our backlog may be cancelled, modified or otherwise altered by customers.
Our backlog at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:

 | December 31,2021 | | December 31,2020
 | (In approximate millions)
Nuclear Operations Group | $ | 4,511 | | | 87 | % | | $ | 3,659 | | | 83 | %
Nuclear Power Group | 644 | | | 12 | % | | 726 | | | 16 | %
Nuclear Services Group | 21 | | | 1 | % | | 21 | | | 1 | %
Total Backlog | $ | 5,176 | | | 100 | % | | $ | 4,406 | | | 100 | %

We do not include the value of our unconsolidated joint venture contracts in backlog. These unconsolidated joint ventures are included in our Nuclear Services Group segment. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report for financial information on our equity method investments.
Of the backlog at December 31, 2021, we expect to recognize revenues as follows:

 | 2022 | | 2023 | | Thereafter | | Total
 | (In approximate millions)
Nuclear Operations Group | $ | 1,573 | | | $ | 1,102 | | $ | 1,836 | $ | 4,511
Nuclear Power Group | 260 | | | 142 | | | 242 | | 644 
Nuclear Services Group | 21 | | | — | | | — | | 21 
Total Backlog | $ | 1,854 | | | $ | 1,244 | | $ | 2,078 | $ | 5,176

As of December 31, 2021, our Nuclear Operations Group segment's backlog with the U.S. Government was $4,198.7 million, $121.8 million of which had not yet been funded.
As of December 31, 2021, our Nuclear Services Group segment's backlog with the U.S. Government was $20.6 million, all of which has been funded.
Major new awards from the U.S. Government are typically received following Congressional approval of the budget for the U.S. Government's next fiscal year, which starts October 1, and may not be awarded to us before the end of the calendar year. Due to the fact that most contracts awarded by the U.S. Government are subject to these annual funding approvals, the total values of the underlying programs are significantly larger. In March 2021, we received awards from the U.S. Government with a combined value of $2.2 billion, inclusive of unexercised options, all of which had been added to backlog as of December 31, 2021.
The value of unexercised options excluded from backlog as of December 31, 2021, including previous awards, was approximately $0.4 billion, a portion of which is expected to be awarded annually through 2024, subject to annual Congressional appropriations.
Competition
The competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below.
Nuclear Operations Group. We have specialized technical capabilities that have allowed us to be a valued supplier of nuclear components and fuel for the U.S. Government's naval nuclear fleet since the 1950s.

Revenues from U.S. Government contracts comprised 98%, 87% and 85% of revenues in our Nuclear Services Group segment for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Our operations use raw materials, such as carbon and alloy steels in various forms and components and accessories for assembly, which are available from numerous sources. We generally purchase these raw materials and components as needed for individual contracts. Although shortages of some raw materials have existed occasionally, no serious shortage exists at the present time.
Our Nuclear Operations Group segment relies on several single-source suppliers for materials used in its products. We believe these suppliers are reliable, and we and the U.S. Government expend significant effort to monitor and maintain the supplier base for our Nuclear Operations Group segment. Our Nuclear Power Group and Nuclear Services Group segments do not depend on single sources of supply for materials used in their products. We have limited supply options for certain raw materials used in our Nuclear Power Group segment; however, we believe the suppliers of these materials are reliable.
Human Capital Management
People Strong, Innovation Driven. Our employees are responsible for providing safe and effective nuclear solutions for global security, clean energy, environmental restoration, nuclear medicine and space exploration. Through their hard work and innovation, we have developed new technologies that benefit our customers, build our business and enhance our lives.
Our goal is to be the employer of choice within our industry and the communities in which we operate. We focus on maintaining a solid pipeline of talent throughout our organization and continually developing the capabilities and skills needed for the future of our business. We strive to maintain a highly-skilled and diverse workforce where employees are recruited, compensated, retained and promoted based on their performance and contribution to the Company.
Employees. At December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 6,600 persons worldwide, predominantly in the U.S. (5,350 employees) and Canada (1,250 employees). Many of our operations are subject to union contracts, which we customarily renew periodically. At December 31, 2021, approximately 1,650 of our employees were members of labor unions. We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory.
Employee Compensation and Benefits. Our compensation plans are designed to reward our employees for achieving and exceeding objectives that create long-term value for shareholders. The success and growth of our business is attributable to our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented and high-performing employees at all levels in our Company. Our compensation programs are designed to ensure we have the ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees to achieve our objectives.
Providing comprehensive, competitive, and affordable retirement, health and other benefits is also important to our attraction and retention strategy. We offer health benefits which include various medical/pharmacy plan options, health savings accounts for those in high deductible health plans, and flexible spending accounts for both health care and dependent care are also available to employees. We also offer retirement, investment, and tax savings/deferral opportunities to our employees.
Employee Development. The professional development of our employees is critical to our success. We offer online and in-person professional development, training and other programs, as well as mentoring programs, to enhance the knowledge, skills and advancement opportunities for our employees. To further our employee development goals, we partner with a number of education institutions for accredited, vocational and other programs and provide tuition reimbursement to employees pursuing job-related, careering enhancing courses.

Diversity and Inclusion. We value the diversity of our employees and are committed to providing an engaging and inclusive atmosphere for all employees that promotes productivity and encourages creativity and innovation. In 2018, we formed a Diversity and Inclusion ("D&I") Committee comprised of a rotating group of employees representing various job functions, levels and backgrounds. The D&I Committee works to identify and implement changes to promote awareness and foster a culture of diversity and inclusion throughout the workforce. In addition, we participate in numerous conferences and career fairs each year that focus on diversity, including those hosted by the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Women Engineers and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers.
Health and Safety. The safety of our employees is critical to our success as a specialty manufacturer of nuclear components and an operator of high-consequence nuclear and national security facilities for the U.S. Government. As such, we are committed to maintaining the highest safety, security, ethical and environmental standards. We maintain comprehensive safety programs focused on identifying risks and eliminating hazards that could lead to serious injuries. We further provide our employees upfront and ongoing safety training to ensure that safety policies and procedures are effectively communicated and implemented.
We take pride in the fact that we operate NRC Category 1 and Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission ("CNSC") licensed facilities and have instilled as a core value a culture that prioritizes safety with a vision of zero accidents at these and all of our work locations. In pursuit of an injury-free workplace, we constantly monitor and assess all injuries and "near misses" for any lessons we can learn and leverage to reduce the risk inherent in occupational activities. We provide regular safety training to our employees and conduct safety culture surveys to identify employee concerns. We use this information to further develop our safety program in an effort to prevent future occupational and environmental incidents.
Ethics and Integrity. We believe that maintaining a work environment that recognizes effort and teamwork, values mutual respect and open communication, and demonstrates care and concern for our employees' well-being is essential to retaining an engaged and productive workforce. Our Code of Business Conduct ("Code") establishes the principles and standards that we expect our employees to follow. Each officer, director and employee is required to use good ethical judgment when conducting business; be respectful of colleagues, business partners, customers and others in their interactions; and comply with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The Code describes what is appropriate behavior and guides ethical business decisions that maintain a commitment to integrity. In furtherance of this objective, we provide regular training on the Code for our employees to identify and prevent misconduct, and the Code requires that employees report situations that violate our policies and/or negatively impact our work environment. In addition, we maintain the BWXT Ethics Helpline to allow employees to report any concerns relating to ethics or other concerns confidentially and, if they choose, anonymously. We investigate and take prompt action to correct conduct that is inconsistent with our Code and other policies.
COVID-19. In 2020, we implemented safety protocols and new procedures to protect our employees and contractors in response to the novel strain of coronavirus ("COVID-19"). These protocols included complying with social distancing and other 
health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies and taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities.
In 2021, we provided opportunities for our employees to receive COVID-19 vaccination both on-site and at sponsored clinics at no cost. For a detailed discussion of the impact of COVID-19, see "COVID-19 Assessment" in Item 7 of this Report.
Patents and Technology Licenses
We currently hold a large number of U.S. and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in certain technologies, including nuclear reactor systems, components and fuel, advanced and additive manufacturing, space nuclear propulsion, and radioisotope production. We acquire patents and technology licenses and grant licenses to others when we consider it advantageous for us to do so. Although in the aggregate our patents and technology licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of know-how, rather than patents and technology licenses, in the conduct of our various businesses.
Research and Development Activities
Our research and development activities are related to the development and improvement of new and existing products and equipment, as well as conceptual and engineering evaluation for translation into practical applications. These activities include the development of isotope production, medical radiochemical and radiopharmaceutical production and a variety of advanced technologies in the areas of additive and autonomous manufacturing, space nuclear power and propulsion, and high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, among others. These projects are sponsored and funded through internal research and development and by a number of commercial and government customers.
We charge the costs of research and development unrelated to specific contracts as incurred. Excluding customer-sponsored research and development, the majority of our activities in this area for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 related to the development of technologies in the area of medical and industrial radioisotopes, additive and autonomous manufacturing and advanced reactors. Contractual arrangements for customer-sponsored research and development can vary on a case-by-case basis and include contracts, cooperative agreements and grants.
See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report for further information on research and development.
Hazard Risks and Insurance
Our operations present risks of injury to or death of people, loss of or damage to property and damage to the environment. We have created loss control systems and processes to assist us in the identification and treatment of the hazard risks presented by our operations, and we endeavor to make sure these systems are effective.
As loss control measures will not always be successful, we seek to establish various means of funding losses and transferring financial liability related to incidents or occurrences. We primarily seek to do this through contractual protections, including waivers of consequential damages, indemnities, caps on liability, liquidated damages provisions and access to the insurance of other parties. We also procure insurance, operate our own captive insurance company and/or establish funded or unfunded reserves. However, none of these methods will eliminate all risks.
Depending on competitive conditions, the nature of the work, industry custom and other factors, we may not be successful in obtaining adequate contractual protection from our customers and other parties against losses and liabilities arising out of or related to the performance of our work. The scope of the protection may be limited, may be subject to conditions and may not be supported by adequate insurance or other means of financing. In addition, we may have difficulty enforcing our contractual rights with others following a material loss.
Similarly, insurance for certain potential losses or liabilities may not be available or may only be available at a cost or on terms we consider not to be economical. Insurers frequently react to market losses by ceasing to write or severely limiting coverage for certain exposures. Risks that we have frequently found difficult to cost-effectively insure against include, but are not limited to, property losses from wind, flood and earthquake events, nuclear hazards and war, pollution liability, liabilities related to occupational health exposures (including asbestos), liability related to our executives, professional liability/errors and omissions coverage, the failure, misuse or unavailability of our information technology systems, the failure of security measures designed to protect our information technology systems from security breaches and liability related to risk of loss of 
our work in progress. In cases where we purchase insurance, we are subject to the creditworthiness of the relevant insurer(s), the available limits of the coverage, our retention under the relevant policy, exclusions in the policy and gaps in coverage.
Our operations in designing, engineering, manufacturing, constructing and servicing nuclear power equipment and components for our commercial nuclear utility customers subject us to various risks, including, without limitation, damage to our customers' property and third-party claims for personal injury, environmental liability, death and property damage. To protect against liability for damage to a customer's property, we endeavor to obtain waivers of liability and subrogation from the customer and its insurer. We also attempt to cap our overall liability in our contracts. To protect against liability from claims brought by third parties, we seek to be insured under the utility customer's nuclear liability policies and have the benefit of the indemnity and limitation of any applicable liability provision of the Price-Anderson Act. The Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability of U.S. manufacturers and operators of licensed nuclear facilities and other parties who may be liable in respect of, and indemnifies them against, all claims in excess of a certain amount. This amount is determined by the sum of commercially available liability insurance plus certain retrospective premium assessments payable by operators of commercial nuclear reactors. For those sites where we provide environmental remediation services, we seek the same protection from our customers as we do for our other nuclear activities. The Price-Anderson Act, as amended, includes a sunset provision and requires renewal each time that it expires. Contracts that were entered into during a period of time that the Price-Anderson Act was in full force and effect continue to receive the benefit of the Price-Anderson Act's nuclear indemnity. The Price-Anderson Act is set to expire on December 31, 2025. We also provide nuclear fabrication and other services to the nuclear power industry in Canada. Canada's Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act ("NLCA") generally conforms to international conventions and is conceptually similar to the Price-Anderson Act in the U.S. Accordingly, indemnification protections and the possibility of exclusions under Canada's NLCA are similar to those under the Price-Anderson Act in the U.S.
We supply commercial nuclear equipment and services to certain customers in countries other than the U.S. and Canada that are party to international treaties and in countries that are not signatory to international treaties but have their own nuclear liability laws that, in general, have regulations in place whereby nuclear operators are solely liable for nuclear damage claims, which would exclude nuclear suppliers from any such exposure. BWXT does retain some level of risk in the event of future changes to the legal landscape in these countries regarding international third-party nuclear liability.
In 2008, the U.S. ratified the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage ("CSC") with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The CSC is an international treaty developed to create a global legal framework for allocating responsibility and assuring prompt and equitable compensation in the unlikely event of certain nuclear incidents. The ratification by the U.S. authorizes the Secretary of Energy to issue regulations establishing a retrospective risk pooling program whereby, in the event that the U.S. must make a contribution to the CSC international fund, U.S. nuclear suppliers, including BWXT, would pay the full cost of this contribution by the U.S.
Although we do not own or operate any nuclear reactors, we have some coverage under commercially available nuclear liability and property insurance for our facilities that are currently licensed to possess special nuclear materials. Substantially all of our Nuclear Operations Group segment contracts involving nuclear materials are covered by and subject to the nuclear indemnity provisions of either the Price-Anderson Act or Public Law 85-804, which, among other things, authorizes the DOE to indemnify certain contractors when such acts would facilitate national defense. However, to the extent the value of the nuclear materials in our care, custody or control exceeds the commercially available limits of our insurance, we potentially have underinsured risk of loss for such nuclear material.
Our Nuclear Services Group segment participates in the management and operation of various U.S. Government facilities. This participation is customarily accomplished through the participation in joint ventures with other contractors for any given facility. These activities involve, among other things, handling nuclear devices and their components. Insurable liabilities arising from these sites are rarely protected by our or our partners' corporate insurance programs. Instead, we rely on government contractual agreements and insurance purchased specifically for a site. The U.S. Government has historically fulfilled its contractual agreement to reimburse its contractors for covered claims, and we expect it to continue this process during our participation in the management and operation of these facilities. However, in most of these situations in which the U.S. Government is contractually obligated to pay, the payment obligation is subject to the availability of authorized government funds. The reimbursement obligation of the U.S. Government is also conditional, and provisions of the relevant contract or applicable law may preclude reimbursement.
Our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary provides primary workers' compensation, employer's liability, commercial general liability and automotive liability insurance to support our operations. We may also have business reasons in the future to have our insurance subsidiary accept other risks that we cannot or do not wish to transfer to outside insurance companies. These risks may be considerable in any given year or cumulatively. Our insurance subsidiary does not provide 
insurance to unrelated parties. Claims as a result of our operations could adversely impact the ability of our insurance subsidiary to respond to all claims presented.
Additionally, upon the February 22, 2006 effectiveness of the settlement relating to the Chapter 11 proceedings involving several of our former subsidiaries, most of our subsidiaries contributed substantial insurance rights to the asbestos personal injury trust, including rights to (1) certain pre-1979 primary and excess insurance coverages and (2) certain of our 1979-1986 excess insurance coverage. These insurance rights provided coverage for, among other things, asbestos and other personal injury claims, subject to the terms and conditions of the policies. The contribution of these insurance rights was made in exchange for the agreement on the part of the representatives of the asbestos claimants, including the representative of future claimants, to the entry of a permanent injunction, pursuant to Section 524(g) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, to channel to the asbestos trust all asbestos-related general liability claims against our subsidiaries and former subsidiaries arising out of, resulting from or attributable to their operations, and the implementation of related releases and indemnification provisions protecting those subsidiaries and their affiliates from future liability for such claims. Although we are not aware of any significant, unresolved claims against our subsidiaries and former subsidiaries that are not subject to the channeling injunction and that relate to the periods during which such excess insurance coverage related, with the contribution of these insurance rights to the asbestos personal injury trust, it is possible that we could have underinsured or uninsured exposure for non-derivative asbestos claims or other personal injury or other claims that would have been insured under these coverages had the insurance rights not been contributed to the asbestos personal injury trust. In conjunction with the spin-off, claims and liabilities associated with the asbestos personal injury, property damage and indirect property damage claims mentioned above have been expressly assumed by BWE pursuant to the master separation agreement between us and BWE.
Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters
Governmental Regulations
Many aspects of our operations and properties are affected by political developments and are subject to both domestic and foreign governmental regulations, including those relating to:
•possessing and processing special nuclear materials;
•workplace health and safety;
•constructing and equipping electric power facilities;
•currency conversions and repatriation;
•taxation of earnings; and
•protecting the environment.
We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. The kinds of permits, licenses and certificates required in our operations depend upon a number of factors.
We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations may affect our future operations.
Environmental
Our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of increasingly complex and stringent federal, foreign, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances and the health and safety of employees. Sanctions for non-compliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws provide for strict, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. In addition, companies may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed.
These laws and regulations include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"), the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and similar laws that provide for responses to, and liability for, releases of hazardous substances into the environment. These laws 
and regulations also include similar foreign, state or local counterparts to these federal laws, which regulate air emissions, water discharges, hazardous substances and waste and require public disclosure related to the use of various hazardous substances. Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, including the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.
We are currently in the process of investigating and remediating some of our current and former operating sites. Although we have recorded reserves in connection with certain of these environmental matters, due to the uncertainties associated with environmental remediation, there can be no assurance that the actual costs resulting from these remediation matters will not exceed the recorded reserves.
Our compliance with federal, foreign, state and local environmental control and protection regulations resulted in pre-tax charges of approximately $17.5 million, $16.3 million and $15.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, compliance with existing environmental regulations necessitated capital expenditures of $3.1 million, $1.2 million and $1.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect to spend another $12.0 million on such capital expenditures over the next five years. We cannot predict all of the environmental requirements or circumstances that will exist in the future, but we anticipate that environmental control and protection standards will become increasingly stringent and costly. Based on our experience to date, we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial condition as a result of future compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation, more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require additional expenditures by us, which may be material. Accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will not incur significant environmental compliance costs in the future.
We have been identified as a potentially responsible party at various cleanup sites under CERCLA. CERCLA and other environmental laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any of the potentially responsible parties, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct. Generally, however, where there are multiple responsible parties, a final allocation of costs is made based on the amount and type of wastes disposed of by each party and the number of financially viable parties, although this may not be the case with respect to any particular site. We have not been determined to be a major contributor of wastes to any of these sites. On the basis of the relative contribution of waste to each site by potentially responsible parties, as well as the financial solvency of other potentially responsible parties, we expect our share of the ultimate liability for the various sites will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any given year.
Environmental remediation projects have been and continue to be undertaken at certain of our current and former facilities. In 2002, Congress directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Army Corps") to clean up radioactive waste at the Shallow Land Disposal Area located in Parks Township, Armstrong County, Pennsylvania (the "SLDA"), consistent with the Memorandum of Understanding between the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the United States Army Corps of Engineers for Coordination on Cleanup and Decommissioning of the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program Sites with NRC-Licensed Facilities, dated July 5, 2001 (the "MOU"). From 1961 to 1970, the SLDA was operated by the Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation ("NUMEC") pursuant to Atomic Energy Commission ("AEC") License SNM-145. The AEC was the predecessor to the NRC. The SLDA was used for the disposal of waste from NUMEC's nuclear fuels fabrication facility in Apollo, Pennsylvania. Both radioactive and non-radioactive waste was disposed in a series of trenches at the SLDA. NUMEC, a former subsidiary of Atlantic Richfield Company ("ARCO") was acquired by BWXT in November 1971. Shortly after the Army Corps' contractor commenced cleanup operations in 2011, the Army Corps ceased excavation activities because the contractor deviated from accepted field procedures, and the excavated material was found to be complex and beyond the Army Corps' characterization and management procedures. The MOU was modified in late 2014 to add the DOE and the NNSA as parties to deal with "special nuclear materials." In December 2014, the Army Corps issued a Proposed Record of Decision Amendment, which reflects a revised cost estimate of $350 million, in addition to the $62 million expended through September 2014, to implement the selected remedy. In October 2018, the Army Corps confirmed award of the previously protested remediation contract as amended to the original contractor. In March 2019, the Army Corps issued a notice-to-proceed to this contractor. The federal legislation directing the Army Corps to clean up the SLDA also directs the Army Corps to seek to recover response costs from appropriate responsible parties in accordance with CERCLA. In connection with BWXT's acquisition of NUMEC from ARCO in November 1971, ARCO assumed and agreed to indemnify and hold harmless BWXT with respect to claims and liabilities arising as a result of transactions or operations of NUMEC prior to the acquisition date. Although this ARCO indemnity would cover claims by the Army Corps to seek recovery from BWXT for SLDA cleanup costs, no assurance can be given that this indemnity will be available or sufficient in the event such claims are asserted. For additional discussion of environmental matters, see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
We perform significant amounts of work for the U.S. Government under both prime contracts and subcontracts and operate certain facilities that are licensed to possess and process special nuclear materials. As a result of these activities, we are subject to continuing reviews by governmental agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the NRC. We are also involved in manufacturing activities at licensed facilities in Canada that are subject to continuing reviews by governmental agencies in Canada, including the CNSC.
The NRC's decommissioning regulations require our Nuclear Operations Group segment to provide financial assurance that it will be able to pay the expected cost of decommissioning its two licensed facilities at the end of their service lives. We provided financial assurance totaling $61.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 with surety bonds for the ultimate decommissioning of these licensed facilities. These facilities have provisions in their government contracts pursuant to which substantially all of our decommissioning costs and financial assurance obligations are covered by the DOE, including the costs to complete the decommissioning projects underway at the facility in Erwin, Tennessee. The surety bonds noted above are to cover decommissioning required pursuant to work not subject to this DOE obligation.
In Canada, the CNSC's decommissioning regulations require our Nuclear Power Group segment to provide financial assurance that it will be able to pay the expected cost of decommissioning its CNSC-licensed facilities at the end of their service lives. We provided financial assurance totaling $46.4 million and $47.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with letters of credit and surety bonds for the ultimate decommissioning of these licensed facilities.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had total environmental accruals, including asset retirement obligations, of $102.4 million and $91.3 million, respectively. Of our total environmental accruals at December 31, 2021 and 2020, $9.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, were included in current liabilities. Inherent in the estimates of these accruals are our expectations regarding the levels of contamination, decommissioning costs and recoverability from other parties, which may vary significantly as decommissioning activities progress. Accordingly, changes in estimates could result in material adjustments to our operating results, and the ultimate loss may differ materially from the amounts we have provided for in our consolidated financial statements.
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
From time to time, our management or persons acting on our behalf make forward-looking statements to inform existing and potential security holders about our Company. Statements and assumptions regarding expectations and projections of specific projects, our future backlog, revenues, income and capital spending, strategic investments, acquisitions or divestitures, return of capital activities, margin improvement initiatives or impacts of COVID-19 are examples of forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as "estimate," "project," "predict," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "seek," "goal," "could," "intend," "may," "should" or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. In addition, sometimes we will specifically describe a statement as being a forward-looking statement and refer to this cautionary statement.
Statements in this Report, including those that express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. Those forward-looking statements appear in Item 1, Item 3, Item 7 and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report and elsewhere in this Report.
We have based our forward-looking statements on information currently available to us and our current expectations, estimates and projections about our industries, business environment and our Company. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not rely unduly on them as they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we have based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. For example, the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our business will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the length and severity of the COVID-19 health crisis, the potential recurrence of COVID-19, subsequent waves or strains or the development of similar diseases, the actions to contain the impact of such diseases and potential responses to such actions by our suppliers, contractors and employees. While our management considers these statements and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to numerous factors, including potentially the risk factors described in the section labeled Item 1A of this Report, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in our forward-looking statements.
We have discussed many of these factors in more detail elsewhere in this Report, including under the heading "COVID-19 Assessment" in Item 7 of this Report. These factors are not necessarily all the factors that could affect us. Unpredictable or unanticipated factors we have not discussed in this Report could also have material adverse effects on actual results of matters that are the subject of our forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update or review any forward-
looking statement or our description of important factors, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable laws.
