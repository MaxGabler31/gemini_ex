ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
THE COMPANY
    CHS Inc. (referred to herein as "CHS," "we," "us" or "our") is the nation's leading integrated agricultural cooperative, providing grain, food, agronomy and energy resources to businesses and consumers on a global basis. As a cooperative, we are owned by farmers and ranchers and member cooperatives (referred to herein as "members") across the United States. We also have preferred shareholders that own shares of our five series of preferred stock, all of which are listed and traded on the Global Select Market of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. We buy commodities from and provide products and services to individual agricultural producers, local cooperatives and other companies (including our members and other nonmember customers), both domestically and internationally. We provide a wide variety of products and services, ranging from initial agricultural inputs such as fuels, farm supplies, crop nutrients and crop protection products to agricultural outputs that include grains and oilseeds, processed grains and oilseeds, renewable fuels and food products. A portion of our operations are conducted through equity investments and joint ventures whose operating results are not fully consolidated with our results; rather, a proportionate share of the income or loss from those equity investments and joint ventures is included as a component of our net income using the equity method of accounting. For the year ended August 31, 2022, our total revenues were $47.8 billion and net income attributable to CHS was $1.7 billion.
    We have aligned our segments based on an assessment of how our businesses operate and the products and services they sell. Our Energy segment derives its revenues through refining, wholesaling and retailing of petroleum products. Our Ag segment derives its revenues through origination and marketing of grain, including service activities conducted at export terminals; through wholesale agronomy sales of crop nutrient and crop protection products; from sales of soybean meal, soybean refined oil and soyflour products; through the production and marketing of renewable fuels; and through retail sales of petroleum and agronomy products, processed sunflowers, feed and farm supplies. Our Ag segment also records equity income from our grain export joint venture and other investments. Our Nitrogen Production segment consists of our equity method investment in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC ("CF Nitrogen"), and allocated expenses. Our other business operations, primarily our financing and hedging businesses, are included in Corporate and Other because of the nature of their products and services, as well as the relative amount of revenues from those businesses. In addition, our nonconsolidated food production and distribution joint venture, Ventura Foods, LLC ("Ventura Foods"), and our nonconsolidated wheat milling joint venture, Ardent Mills, LLC ("Ardent Mills"), are included in Corporate and Other. For the year ended August 31, 2021, our equity method investment in Ventura Foods was reported separately as our Foods segment. Segment results and balances prior to fiscal 2022 have been recast to reflect Ventura Foods as a component of Corporate and Other. 
    Our earnings from cooperative business are allocated to members and to a limited extent to nonmembers with which we have agreed to do business on a patronage basis based on the volume of business they do with us. We allocate these earnings to our patrons in the form of patronage refunds, which are also called patronage dividends, and which may be in cash, patrons' equities in the form of capital equity certificates or both. Patrons' equities may be redeemed over time solely at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Earnings derived from nonmembers, which are not treated as patronage, are taxed at federal and state statutory corporate rates and are retained by us as unallocated capital reserves. We also receive patronage refunds from the cooperatives in which we are a member, if those cooperatives have earnings to distribute and if we qualify for patronage refunds from them.
    Our origins date back to the early 1930s with the founding of our predecessor companies, Cenex, Inc., and Harvest States Cooperatives. CHS Inc. emerged as the result of the merger of those two entities in 1998 and is headquartered in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota.
    Our internet address is www.chsinc.com. The information contained on our website is not part of, and is not incorporated in, this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
ENERGY
Overview
    We are the nation's largest cooperative energy company based on revenues and identifiable assets, with operations that include petroleum refining and pipelines; supply, marketing and distribution of refined fuels (gasoline, diesel fuel and other energy products); blending, sale and distribution of lubricants; and wholesale supply of propane and other natural gas liquids. Our Energy segment processes crude oil into refined petroleum products at our refineries in Laurel, Montana, and McPherson, Kansas, and sells those products under the Cenex® brand to member cooperatives and other independent retailers through a network of nearly 1,500 sites, the majority of which are convenience stores marketing Cenex-branded fuels and owned by our member cooperatives. For fiscal 2022, our Energy revenues, after elimination of intersegment revenues, were $10.3 billion and were primarily from gasoline, diesel fuel and propane.
Operations
    Laurel refinery. Our Laurel, Montana, refinery processes medium- and high-sulfur crude oil into refined petroleum products that primarily include gasoline, diesel fuel, asphalt and petroleum coke. Our Laurel refinery sources approximately 93% of its crude oil supply from Canada, with the remaining balance obtained from domestic sources, and we have access to Canadian and northwest Montana crude oil through our wholly-owned Front Range Pipeline, LLC, and other common carrier pipelines. Our Laurel refinery also has access to Wyoming crude oil via common carrier pipelines from the south.
    Our Laurel refinery processes approximately 63,000 barrels of crude oil per day to produce refined products that consist of approximately 39% gasoline, 42% diesel fuel and other distillates, 10% asphalt, 6% petroleum coke and 3% other products. Refined fuels produced at our Laurel refinery are available via railcars and via the Yellowstone Pipeline to western Montana terminals and to Spokane, Washington; south via common carrier pipelines to Wyoming terminals and Denver, Colorado; and east via our wholly-owned Cenex Pipeline, LLC, to Glendive, Montana, and to Minot, Prosper and Fargo, North Dakota.
    McPherson refinery. Our McPherson, Kansas, refinery processes approximately 60% low- and medium-sulfur crude oil and approximately 40% heavy-sulfur crude oil into gasoline, diesel fuel and other distillates, petroleum coke and other products. The refinery sources its crude oil through its own pipelines, as well as through joint venture and common carrier pipelines. Low- and medium-sulfur crude oil is sourced from Kansas, Colorado, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas, and heavy-sulfur crude oil is sourced from Canada and Wyoming.
    Our McPherson refinery processes approximately 114,000 barrels of crude oil per day to produce refined products that consist of approximately 50% gasoline, 43% diesel fuel and other distillates, 5% petroleum coke and 2% other products. These products are loaded into trucks at the McPherson refinery or shipped via common carrier pipelines to other markets.
Other energy operations. We operate six propane terminals, four asphalt terminals, seven refined product terminals and three lubricants blending and packaging facilities. We also own and lease a fleet of liquid and pressure trailers and tractors, which transport refined fuels, propane, anhydrous ammonia and other products.
Products and Services
    Our Energy segment produces and sells (primarily wholesale) gasoline, diesel fuel, propane, asphalt, lubricants and other related products, and also provides transportation services. In addition to selling products refined at our Laurel and McPherson refineries, we purchase refined petroleum products from third parties. For fiscal 2022, we obtained approximately 82% of the refined petroleum products we sold from our Laurel and McPherson refineries and approximately 18% from third parties.
Sales and Marketing: Customers
    We market approximately 80% of our refined fuel products to members, with the balance sold to nonmembers. Sales are made wholesale to member cooperatives and through a network of independent retailers that operate convenience stores under the Cenex brand. We sold approximately 1.5 billion gallons of gasoline and approximately 1.7 billion gallons of diesel fuel in fiscal 2022. We also blend, package and wholesale auto and farm equipment lubricants to members and nonmembers. We are one of the nation's largest propane wholesalers based on revenues. Most of the propane sold in rural areas is for heating and agricultural usage. Annual sales volumes of propane vary greatly depending on weather patterns and crop conditions.
Industry: Competition
    The petroleum business is highly cyclical. Demand for crude oil and energy products is driven by the condition of local and worldwide economies, local and regional weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources, which can significantly affect the price of refined fuel products. Our Energy segment generally experiences higher volumes and revenues in certain operating areas, such as refined products in the spring, summer and early fall when gasoline and diesel fuel usage by our agricultural customers is highest and is subject to domestic supply and demand forces. Other energy products, such as propane, generally experience higher volumes and revenues during the winter heating and crop-drying seasons. More fuel-efficient equipment, reduced crop tillage, depressed prices for crops, weather conditions and government programs that encourage idle acres may all reduce demand for our energy products.
    Regulation. Governmental regulations and policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, have a significant impact on our Energy segment. Our Energy segment's operations are subject to laws and related regulations and rules designed to protect the environment that are administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT"), the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and similar government agencies. These laws, regulations and rules govern, among other things, discharge of materials into the environment, including air and water; reporting storage of hazardous wastes and other hazardous materials; transportation, handling and disposal of wastes and other materials; labeling of pesticides and similar substances; and investigation and remediation of the release of hazardous materials. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and rules could subject us to administrative penalties, injunctive relief, civil remedies and possible product recalls. Our hedging transactions and activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the exchanges we use and to governing bodies, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ("CME"), the New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX") and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC").
    Competition. The petroleum refining and wholesale fuels business is very competitive. Among our competitors are some of the world's largest integrated petroleum companies, which have their own crude oil supplies and distribution and marketing systems. We also compete with smaller domestic refiners and marketers in the midwestern and northwestern United States, with foreign refiners who import products into the United States and with producers and marketers in other industries supplying other forms of energy and fuels to consumers. Given the commodity nature of the end products, profitability in the industry depends largely on margins, as well as operating efficiency, product mix and costs of product distribution and transportation. The retail gasoline market is highly competitive, with competitors that are much larger than CHS and have greater brand recognition and distribution outlets throughout the country and the world than we do. We also are experiencing increased competition from regional and unbranded retailers. Our owned and nonowned retail outlets are located primarily in the northwestern, midwestern and southern United States.
    We market refined fuel products in five principal geographic areas. The first area includes the Midwest and Northern Plains. Competition at the wholesale level in this area includes major oil companies, as well as independent refiners and wholesale brokers and/or suppliers. This area has a robust spot market and is influenced by the large refinery center along the Gulf Coast.
    To the east of the Midwest and Northern Plains is another unique marketing area. This area centers near Chicago, Illinois, and includes eastern Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana. In this area, we principally compete with the major oil companies, as well as independent refiners and wholesale brokers and/or suppliers.
    Another market area includes Arkansas, Missouri and the northern part of Texas. Competition in this area includes the major oil companies and independent refiners. This area is principally supplied by the Gulf Coast refinery center and is also driven by a strong spot market that reacts quickly to changes in the international and national supply balance.
    Another geographic area includes Montana, western North Dakota, Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, Colorado and western South Dakota. Competition at the wholesale level in this area includes the major oil companies and independent refiners.
    The last area includes much of Washington and Oregon. We compete with the major oil companies in this area, which is known for volatile prices and an active spot market.
AG
Overview
    Our Ag segment includes global grain and processing, country operations and wholesale agronomy businesses. These businesses work together to facilitate the production, purchase, sale and eventual use of grain and other agricultural products within the United States, as well as internationally. In fiscal 2022, revenues in our Ag segment were $37.5 billion after elimination of intersegment revenues.
Operations
Global grain and processing. We are the nation's largest cooperative marketer of grain and oilseed based on grain sales. Our global grain marketing operations purchase grain directly from agricultural producers and elevator operators primarily in the midwestern and western United States and indirectly through our country operations business. Purchased grain is typically contracted for sale for future delivery at a specified location, and we are responsible for handling the grain and either arranging for or facilitating its transportation to that location. We own and operate export terminals, river terminals and elevators throughout the United States to handle and transport grain and grain products. We also maintain locations in Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Rim and South America for marketing, merchandising and/or sourcing grains and crop nutrients. We primarily conduct our global grain marketing operations directly, but do conduct some of our operations through joint ventures, including TEMCO, LLC ("TEMCO"), a 50%-owned joint venture with Cargill, Incorporated ("Cargill"), that focuses on exports, primarily to Asia.
Our processing business includes our oilseed processing and renewable fuels production businesses. Oilseed processing is conducted at facilities that crush approximately 132 million bushels of oilseeds on an annual basis, producing approximately 2.7 million short tons of meal and flour and 1.7 billion pounds of edible and inedible oil annually. We purchase our oilseeds from members, other CHS businesses and third parties that have tightly integrated connections with our global grain marketing operations and country operations business. Our renewable fuels business produces 260 million gallons of fuel-grade ethanol, 70 million pounds of inedible corn oil and 640,000 tons of dried distillers grains with solubles ("DDGS") annually. Renewable fuels produced by our production plants are marketed by our global grain marketing business, along with more than 522 million gallons of ethanol and 3.8 million tons of DDGS annually under marketing agreements with ethanol production plants. 
Country operations. Our country operations business operates 379 agri-operations locations through 28 business units dispersed throughout the midwestern and western United States. Most of these locations purchase grain from farmers and sell agronomy, energy, feed and seed products to those same producers and others, although not all locations provide every product and service. We also manufacture animal feed through nine owned plants and three limited liability companies.
Wholesale agronomy. Our wholesale agronomy business includes our wholesale crop nutrients and wholesale crop protection businesses. Our wholesale crop nutrients business delivers products directly to our customers and our country operations business from the manufacturer or through our 11 warehouse terminals and other nonowned storage facilities located throughout the United States. To supplement what is purchased domestically, our Galveston, Texas, deepwater port and terminal receives fertilizer by vessel from origins such as Asia and the Caribbean Basin where significant volumes of urea are produced. The fertilizer is then shipped by rail to destinations within crop-producing regions of the United States. Our wholesale crop protection business operates out of our network of 28 warehouses from which we deliver products directly to our member cooperatives and independent retailers. We also operate a bulk chemical rail terminal in Brooten, Minnesota, where we handle and store bulk crop protection products for some of the crop protection industry's largest chemical manufacturers. This facility has approximately six million gallons of chemical storage capacity.
Products and Services
    Our Ag segment provides local cooperatives and farmers with the inputs and services they need to produce grain and raise livestock. These include seed, crop nutrients, crop protection products, animal feed, animal health products, refined fuels and propane. We also buy and merchandise grain in both domestic and international markets. With a portion of the grain we purchase, we produce renewable fuels, including ethanol and DDGS. We also produce refined oils, meal and soyflour at our processing facilities.
Sales and Marketing: Customers
    Our Ag segment provides products and services to a wide range of customers, primarily in the United States. These customers include member and nonmember producers, local cooperatives, elevators, grain dealers, grain processors and crop nutrient and crop protection retailers. We sell our edible oils and soyflour to food companies and our inedible oils may be sold to energy companies. The soybean meal we produce is sold to integrated livestock producers and feed mills. The ethanol and DDGS we produce are sold throughout the United States and to various international customers. 
Industry: Competition
Many of the business activities in our Ag segment are highly seasonal and, consequently, the operating results for our Ag segment will typically vary throughout the year. For example, our country operations business generally experiences higher volumes and revenues during the fall harvest and spring planting seasons and our agronomy business generally experiences higher volumes and revenues during the spring planting season. In addition, our Ag segment operations may be adversely affected by relative levels of supply and demand, both domestic and international, commodity price levels and transportation costs and conditions. Supply is affected by weather conditions, plant disease, insect damage, acreage planted, wars and civil unrest, and government regulations and policies. Demand may be affected by foreign governments and their programs, relationships of foreign countries with the United States, affluence of foreign countries, wars and civil unrest, currency exchange fluctuations and substitution of commodities. Demand may also be affected by changes in eating habits, population growth, per capita consumption of some products and renewable fuels production levels. 
Regulation. Our Ag operations are subject to laws and related regulations and rules designed to protect the environment and that are administered by the EPA, the DOT and similar government agencies. These laws, regulations and rules govern, among other things, discharge of materials into the environment, including air and water; reporting storage of hazardous wastes and other hazardous materials; transportation, handling and disposal of wastes and other materials; labeling of pesticides and similar substances; and investigation and remediation of the release of hazardous materials. In addition, environmental laws impose a liability on owners and operators for investigation and remediation of contaminated property and on a party who sends hazardous materials to those contaminated properties for treatment, storage, disposal or recycling. In some instances, that liability exists regardless of fault. Our global grain and processing and country operations businesses are also subject to laws and related regulations and rules administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies that govern processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, and quality and safety of feed and grain products. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and rules could subject us to administrative penalties, injunctive relief, civil remedies and possible product recalls. The hedging transactions and activities of our global grain and processing and country operations businesses are subject to the rules and regulations of the exchanges we use and to the governing bodies, such as the CME, the Chicago Board of Trade ("CBOT"), the Minneapolis Grain Exchange ("MGEX") and the CFTC.
Competition. In our Ag segment, we have significant competition in the businesses in which we operate based principally on price, services, quality, patronage and alternative products. Our businesses depend on relationships with local cooperatives and private retailers, proximity to customers and producers, competitive pricing and safety of food, feed and grain products. We compete with other large distributors of agricultural products, as well as other regional or local distributors, local cooperatives, retailers and manufacturers. 
NITROGEN PRODUCTION
Overview

    Our Nitrogen Production segment consists of our approximate 8% membership interest (based on product tons) in CF Nitrogen, our strategic venture with CF Industries Holdings, Inc. ("CF Industries"), and allocated expenses. In connection with our investment in CF Nitrogen, we entered into a supply agreement with CF Nitrogen that entitles us to purchase up to 1.1 million tons of granular urea and 580,000 tons of urea ammonium nitrate ("UAN") annually for ratable delivery through fiscal 2096. We account for our CF Nitrogen investment using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method. On August 31, 2022, our investment was approximately $2.6 billion. See Note 6, Investments, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Our investment in CF Nitrogen positions us and our members for long-term, dependable fertilizer supply, supply chain efficiency and production economics. In addition, the ability to source products from CF Nitrogen production facilities under our supply agreement benefits our members and customers through strategically positioned access to essential fertilizer products.
Operations
CF Nitrogen has six production facilities located in Donaldsonville, Louisiana; Port Neal, Iowa; Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada; Yazoo City, Mississippi; and Woodward and Verdigris, Oklahoma. Natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process. CF Nitrogen has access to competitively priced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines connected to major natural gas trading hubs near its production facilities.
Products and Services
CF Nitrogen produces nitrogen-based products, including methanol, UAN, urea and related products.
Sales and Marketing: Customers
    CF Nitrogen has three customers, including CHS and two consolidated subsidiaries of CF Industries.
Industry: Competition
Regulation. CF Nitrogen is subject to laws and related regulations and rules designed to protect the environment that are administered by the EPA and similar government agencies. These laws, regulations and rules govern, among other things, discharge of materials into the environment, including air and water; reporting storage of hazardous wastes and other hazardous materials; handling and disposal of wastes and other materials; and investigation and remediation of the release of hazardous materials. In addition, environmental laws impose a liability on owners and operators for investigation and remediation of contaminated property and on a party that sends hazardous materials to those contaminated properties for treatment, storage, disposal or recycling. In some instances, that liability exists regardless of fault.
Competition. CF Nitrogen competes primarily on delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. CF Nitrogen competes domestically with a variety of large companies in the fertilizer industry. There is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world.
CORPORATE AND OTHER
CHS Capital. Our wholly-owned financing subsidiary, CHS Capital, LLC ("CHS Capital"), provides member cooperatives with a variety of loans that meet commercial agriculture needs. These loans include operating, term, revolving and other short- and long-term options. CHS Capital also provides loans to individual producers for crop inputs, feed and hedging-related margin calls. Producer operating loans are also offered in strategic geographic regions.
CHS Hedging. Our wholly-owned commodity brokerage subsidiary, CHS Hedging, LLC ("CHS Hedging"), is a registered, CFTC-regulated futures commission merchant ("FCM") and a clearing member of the CBOT, CME, NYMEX and MGEX. CHS Hedging provides consulting services and commodity risk management services primarily in the grains, oilseeds, fertilizer, livestock, dairy and energy markets. CHS Hedging is also the FCM for the majority of our commodity futures trading.
Foods. Ventura Foods is a joint venture between CHS and Mitsui & Co., with each company owning a 50% interest. Ventura Foods produces and distributes edible oil-based products. We account for our investment in Ventura Foods using the equity method of accounting, and the investment balance was equal to $410.1 million on August 31, 2022. See Note 6, Investments, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Wheat milling. Ardent Mills, the largest flour miller in the United States, is a joint venture with CHS, Cargill and Conagra Brands, Inc. ("Conagra"). In connection with the Ardent Mills joint venture, CHS, Cargill and Conagra have various ancillary and noncompete agreements including, among other things, an agreement for us to supply Ardent Mills with certain wheat and durum products. We hold a 12% interest in Ardent Mills and account for our investment as an equity method investment due to our ability to exercise significant influence by appointing a member of the Board of Shareholders and Board of Managers of Ardent Mills. On August 31, 2022, our investment in Ardent Mills was $250.9 million. See Note 6, Investments, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our human capital resources objectives include identifying, attracting, retaining, developing, incentivizing and onboarding our current and new employees. We monitor our progress toward these objectives by measuring human capital metrics such as engagement, total and regrettable turnover, hiring statistics and overall cost of human resources delivery. In addition to these objectives, we also promote a culture focused on diversity and inclusion, provide learning and development opportunities, maintain the health and safety of our employees, encourage community involvement and offer competitive pay and benefits. Additional information regarding our employee population and human capital strategies is described below.
Employee population. On August 31, 2022, we had 10,014 full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees, primarily in the United States. Of that total, 2,486 were employed in our Energy segment, 6,314 were employed in our Ag segment and 1,214 were employed in Corporate and Other. In addition to those individuals directly employed by us, many individuals work for or support our joint ventures, including CF Nitrogen in our Nitrogen Production segment and Ventura Foods and Ardent Mills in our Corporate and Other category, and are not included in these totals. As of August 31, 2022, we had 12 collective bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 9% of our employees in the United States, with collective bargaining agreements expiring on various dates through August 31, 2026. We believe that our relations with our employees are strong. We value our employees and believe that employee passion for our work and employee engagement are key elements of our operating performance.
Diversity and inclusion. The CHS value of inclusion helps us strive to create a work environment where excellence and growth stem from diverse thinking. Our goal is to foster a workplace where diverse thinking, voices and backgrounds yield better employee experiences, business performance and business outcomes. In addition to working on modeling inclusive behaviors that positively impact our communities, with the assistance of external experts, we developed and launched an enterprisewide three-year strategic plan during fiscal 2021 for improving inclusion and diversity at CHS. We continue to sponsor and support employee resource groups made up of individuals who join together as allies and advocates to promote diversity and inclusion, while providing our employees from across the country the opportunity to strengthen relationships, learn through educational and networking opportunities that focus on development, help local communities and engage with people across CHS. These employee resource groups include Harvest Pride, which promotes a safe, connected and empowered LGBTQA+ community across CHS; Mozaiko, which promotes ethnic diversity and inclusion at CHS while creating an inclusive environment for all employees; VERG, which provides support, camaraderie and resources for employees formerly or currently serving in the military; Women in Leadership, which supports women in the workplace who are excited and energized to grow personally and professionally; and CultivateHER, a cohort within Women in Leadership, which supports women across our Ag segment. 
Learning and development. We are committed to investing in our employees to help them grow and achieve their career goals. In addition to regular performance evaluations and annual development plans that provide employees with feedback and growth opportunities, employees at CHS have access to a variety of learning tools and other opportunities for growth. These tools and opportunities include access to thousands of on-demand learning modules; various internal and external trainings that cover continuous improvement, public speaking, financial and accounting topics and other topics; tuition and professional certification reimbursement; as well as other opportunities focused on developing the future leaders of CHS. 
Health and safety. Safety is one of our core values. We put the well-being of our employees, customers and communities first every day. At CHS, safety isn’t just about following the rules, it is about doing things the right way and remembering that no job is so critical that it warrants safety risks. In addition to defined safety programs designed specifically for individual facilities with operational hazards such as grain, feed, seed, agronomy, petroleum, warehouses and retail stores, we also provide certain employee groups with additional training opportunities such as a defensive driving program. Beyond developing defined safety programs and training opportunities, we also monitor our incident rates in comparison to previous years and industry averages, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. During fiscal 2022, our Occupational Safety & Health Administration ("OSHA") incident rate was 2.9 incidents per 100 full-time workers, as compared to an average of 3.5 incidents per 100 full-time workers during the three previous years, a reduction of 17%, and our DOT crash rate was in the top 4% of all carriers in our industry segment for the entirety of fiscal 2022. 
Community involvement. As a cooperative, we are committed to making a measurable impact in our communities through our giving investments. In addition to our charitable foundation and annual giving campaign, which provide financial support to our communities, eligible employees also receive paid time off to make a difference in our communities through volunteer activities.
Compensation and benefits. We have designed our compensation and benefits programs to attract and retain qualified employees and to motivate employees to optimize member-owner returns and to achieve our long-term strategies. In addition to 
offering competitive compensation that includes annual variable pay linked to our performance, we also offer a wide array of benefits programs that include health insurance and wellness benefits; retirement benefits including a company-matched 401(k) contribution and a pension for qualifying employees; paid time off and family leave; and employee assistance programs, including adoption assistance.
CHS AUTHORIZED CAPITAL
    We are an agricultural membership cooperative organized under Minnesota cooperative law to do business with member and nonmember patrons.
