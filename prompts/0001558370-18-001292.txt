     ITEM 1. BUSINESS
     OVERVIEW
     We are a New York City-based company incorporated in the Marshall Islands in 2004.  We transport iron ore, coal, grain, steel products and other drybulk cargoes along worldwide shipping routes through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels.  Our fleet currently consists of 60 drybulk carriers, including 13 Capesize, six Panamax, four Ultramax, 21 Supramax, one Handymax and 15 Handysize drybulk carriers, with an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately 4,688,000 deadweight tons (“dwt”).  The average age of our current fleet is approximately 9.9 years.  All of the vessels in our fleet were built in shipyards with reputations for constructing high-quality vessels.  Of the vessels in our fleet, 22 are currently on spot market voyage charters, four are currently on spot market-related time charters, and 30 are on fixed-rate time charter contracts.  
     See pages 6 - 11 for a table of all vessels that are currently in our fleet.
     In 2017, we began implementing certain initiatives to expand our commercial platform and more actively manage the employment of our vessels.  We hired commercial directors for our major bulk and minor bulk fleets and have begun employment of our vessels directly with cargo owners under cargo contracts to provide a full logistics solution to major cargo owners.  To better capitalize on opportunities to employ our vessels in markets around the world, we have also expanded our global commercial presence with the establishment of a new office in Singapore and plan to establish an office in Europe.  Additionally, we have withdrawn all of our vessels from their respective pools and are reallocating our freight exposure to the Atlantic basin to seek to capture the earnings premium historically offered.
     The Genco Tiger and Baltic Lion were offhire for a total of approximately 115 days and 34 days, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 to complete repairs to their main engines.  The Genco Tiger’s main engine experienced a breakdown associated with the vessel’s lube filtration system during the first quarter of 2017 and underwent repairs to rectify the issue.  The Baltic Lion, which is a sister vessel to the Genco Tiger, also underwent main engine repairs associated with the lube filtration system.  We received approval from the insurance underwriters during June 2017 for payment on account under our loss of hire insurance in the amount of $1.4 million and $0.3 million for the Genco Tiger and Baltic Lion, respectively, which was recorded as voyage revenue during the second quarter of 2017. During September 2017, we received the approval of the final remaining loss of hire insurance claim for the Genco Tiger of $0.4 million which was recorded as voyage revenue during the third quarter of 2017.  We are awaiting approval of the final remaining loss of hire insurance claim for the Baltic Lion.  Our loss of hire insurance covers the revenue days lost for the two vessels at a rate of twenty thousand dollars per day up to 90 days after a deductible of fourteen days.  As the Genco Tiger had total offhire days of approximately 115 days, 11 days of this offhire exceeded the 90-day loss of hire and fourteen-day deductible period and was not covered by insurance.  
     On November 15, 2016, we completed the private placement of 27,061,856 shares of Series A Preferred Stock which included 25,773,196 shares at a price per share of $4.85 and an additional 1,288,660 shares issued as a commitment fee on a pro rata basis as noted above.  On January 4, 2017, our shareholders approved at a Special Meeting of Shareholders the issuance of up to 27,061,856 shares of common stock of the Company upon the conversion of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, which were purchased by certain investors in a private placement. As a result of such shareholder approval, all outstanding 27,061,856 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were automatically and mandatorily converted into 27,061,856 shares of common stock of the Company on January 4, 2017.  Concurrently with the completion of the private placement, we entered into a new senior secured loan facility (the “$400 Million Credit Facility”) for an aggregate principal amount of up to $400 million, which we used to refinance the outstanding debt under the $100 Million Term Loan Facility, $253 Million Term Loan Facility, $148 Million Credit Facility, $22 Million Term Loan Facility, $44 Million Term Loan Facility and 2015 Revolving Credit Facility, each as

defined in Note 8 — Debt of the Consolidated Financial Statements (collectively, the “Prior Facilities”).  Refer to Note 1 — General Information and Note 8 — Debt in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  
     Pursuant to the final executed $400 Million Credit Facility, we were required to sell or scrap ten of our vessels.  On April 5, 2016, the Board of Directors unanimously approved scrapping the Genco Marine.  We reached an agreement on May 6, 2016 to sell the Genco Marine, a 1996-built Handymax vessel, to be scrapped with Ace Exim Pte Ltd., a demolition yard, which was completed on May 17, 2016. During October 2016, we reached agreements with third-parties to sell three of our vessels, the Genco Pioneer (a 1999-built Handysize vessel), the Genco Sugar (a 1998-built Handysize vessel) and the Genco Leader (a 1999-built Panamax vessel).   These sales were completed during October and November 2016. Additionally, during November 2016 we reached an agreement with a third-party to sell the Genco Acheron (a 1999-built Panamax vessel) for which the sale was completed during December 2016.  Also, during December 2016 the Board of Directors unanimously approved the sale of the Genco Success (a 1997-built Handymax vessel), the Genco Prosperity (a 1997-built Handymax vessel) and the Genco Wisdom (a 1997-built Handymax vessel).  These vessel assets were classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016.  The sale of the Genco Wisdom and Genco Success were completed during January and March 2017, respectively, and the Genco Prosperity was completed during May 2017.  Lastly, during January 2017, the Board of Directors unanimously approved the sale of the Genco Carrier (a 1998-built Handymax vessel) and the Genco Reliance (a 1999-built Handysize vessel).  The sales of these vessels were completed during February 2017.  Refer to Note 4 — Vessel Acquisitions and Dispositions in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
     On July 17, 2015, we merged with our indirect, partially owned subsidiary Baltic Trading Limited (“Baltic Trading”) (the “Merger”). Baltic Trading was consolidated as we also controlled a majority of the voting interest in Baltic Trading prior to the Merger.  Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition includes the results of Baltic Trading.
     We report financial information and evaluate our operations by charter revenues and not by the length of ship employment for our customers, i.e., spot or time charters.  Each of our vessels serve the same type of customer, have similar operations and maintenance requirements, operate in the same regulatory environment, and are subject to similar economic characteristics. Based on this, we have determined that we operate in one reportable segment, after the effective date of the Merger on July 17, 2015, in which we are engaged in the ocean transportation of drybulk cargoes worldwide through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels.  Therefore, the totals previously reported for the two segments (GS&T and Baltic Trading) is the total for the single reportable segment effective upon the Merger.
     Our management team and our other employees are responsible for the commercial and strategic management of our fleet.  Commercial management includes the negotiation of employment for vessels, managing the mix of various types of employment, such as time charters, spot market voyage charters and spot market-related time charters, and monitoring the performance of our vessels under their employment.  Strategic management includes locating, purchasing, financing and selling vessels.  We currently contract with two independent technical managers to provide technical management of our fleet at a lower cost than we believe would be possible in-house.  Technical management involves the day-to-day management of vessels, including performing routine maintenance, attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies.  Members of our New York City-based management team oversee the activities of our independent technical managers.
     Bankruptcy Reorganization
     On April 21, 2014 (the “Petition Date”), Genco Shipping & Trading Limited and its subsidiaries other than Baltic Trading and its subsidiaries (the “Debtors”) filed voluntary cases (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Debtors continued to operate their businesses in the ordinary course as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Through the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors implemented our Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization of the Debtors Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (as amended, the “Prepack Plan”) for which the Company solicited votes from certain classes of its creditors prior to commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases in accordance with the 

 
  2

 
Restructuring Support Agreement that the Debtors entered into with certain of its creditors on April 3, 2014.  The Company subsequently emerged from bankruptcy on July 9, 2014.
     On July 2, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the “Confirmation Order”) confirming the Prepack Plan.  On July 9, 2014 (the “Effective Date”), the Debtors completed their financial restructuring and emerged from Chapter 11 through a series of transactions contemplated by the Prepack Plan, and the Prepack Plan became effective pursuant to its terms.  References to “Successor Company” refer to the Company after July 9, 2014, after giving effect to the application of fresh-start reporting.  References to “Predecessor Company” refer to the Company prior to July 9, 2014.

     BUSINESS STRATEGY 
     Our strategy is to manage and expand our fleet in a manner that maximizes our cash flows from operations.  To accomplish this objective, we intend to:
· | Strategically expand the size of our fleet — We may acquire additional modern, high-quality drybulk carriers through timely and selective acquisitions in a manner that is accretive to our cash flows. If we make such acquisitions, we may consider additional debt or equity financing alternatives. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to operate a high-quality fleet — We intend to maintain a modern, high-quality fleet that meets or exceeds stringent industry standards and complies with charterer requirements through our technical managers’ rigorous and comprehensive maintenance program. In addition, our technical managers maintain the quality of our vessels by carrying out regular inspections, both while in port and at sea. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Implement an active commercial strategy — Our current fleet of 60 drybulk vessels concentrates on the transportation of major and minor bulk commodities globally. Historically, Genco has employed its fleet mostly through time charter contracts as well as pooling arrangements. In 2017, the Company made the strategic decision to augment its existing in-house commercial operating platform and shift from being a 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tonnage provider to being an active owner-operator with the goal of expanding its network of customers and improving its margins. As a result of this strategic shift, we have been fixing an increasing number of vessels on spot market voyage charters directly with cargo providers, where we provide a vessel for the transportation of goods between a load port and discharge port at a specified per-ton or on a lump sum basis. In addition to these spot market voyage charters, we continue to fix our vessels on both short and long-term time charters, as well as spot market-related time charterers, depending on market conditions and outlook. Overall, our fleet deployment strategy is currently weighted towards short-term fixtures which provide optionality in a potentially rising freight rate environment. We may in the future pursue other market opportunities for our vessels to capitalize on market conditions, including arranging longer charter periods, entering into vessel pools and chartering in vessels. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintain low-cost, highly efficient operations — We currently outsource technical management of our fleet to Wallem Shipmanagement Limited (“Wallem”) and Anglo-Eastern Group (“Anglo”), third-party independent technical managers. Our management team actively monitors and controls vessel operating expenses incurred by the independent technical managers by overseeing their activities. Finally, we seek to maintain low-cost, highly efficient operations by capitalizing on the cost savings and economies of scale that result from operating sister ships. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Capitalize on our management team’s reputation — We seek to capitalize on our management team’s reputation for high standards of performance, reliability and safety, and maintain strong relationships with major international charterers and cargo providers, many of whom consider the reputation of a vessel owner and operator when entering into time charters. We believe that our management team’s track record improves our relationships with high quality shipyards and financial institutions, many of which consider reputation to be an indicator of creditworthiness.

      FLEET MANAGEMENT
     Our management team and other employees are responsible for the commercial and strategic management of our fleet.  Commercial management involves negotiating charters for vessels, managing the mix of various types of charters, such as time charters, spot market voyage charters, vessel pools and spot market-related time charters, and 

 
  5

 
monitoring the performance of our vessels under their charters.  Strategic management involves locating, purchasing, financing and selling vessels.
     We utilize the services of reputable independent technical managers, Wallem and Anglo, for the technical management of our fleet.  Technical management involves the day-to-day management of vessels, including performing routine maintenance, attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies.  Members of our New York City-based management team oversee the activities of our independent technical managers.  The head of our technical management team has over 30 years of experience in the shipping industry.
     Wallem, founded in 1971 and Anglo, founded in 1974, are among the largest ship management companies in the world.  These technical managers are known worldwide for their agency networks, covering all major ports in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore.  These technical managers provide services to over 850 vessels of all types, including Capesize, Panamax, Ultramax, Supramax, Handymax and Handysize drybulk carriers that meet strict quality standards.
     Under our technical management agreements, our technical manager is obligated to:
    
· | provide personnel to supervise the maintenance and general efficiency of our vessels;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | arrange and supervise the maintenance of our vessels to our standards to assure that our vessels comply with applicable national and international regulations and the requirements of our vessels’ classification societies;

· | report expense transactions to us, and make its procurement and accounting systems available to us.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      OUR CHARTERS
     As of February 26, 2018, we employed 22 of our vessels on spot market voyage charters where we provide a vessel for the transportation of goods between a load port and discharge port at a specified per-ton or on a lump sum basis.  Under spot market voyage charters, voyage expenses such as fuel and port charges are borne by us.  Additionally, as of February 26, 2018, four of our vessels under spot market-related time charters, which are time charters with rates based on published Baltic Indices.  These types of charters are similar to time charters with the exception of having a variable rate over the term of the time charter agreement.  As such, the revenue earned by these vessels is subject to the fluctuations of the spot market.  Lastly, as of February 26, 2018, we employed 30 of our vessels under fixed-rate time charters.  A time charter involves the hiring of a vessel from its owner for a period of time pursuant to a contract under which the vessel owner places its ship (including its crew and equipment) at the disposal of the charterer.  Under a time charter, the charterer periodically pays a fixed daily charterhire rate to the owner of the vessel and bears all voyage expenses, including the cost of bunkers (fuel), port expenses, agents’ fees and canal dues.
     Our vessels operate worldwide within the trading limits imposed by our insurance terms.  The technical operation and navigation of the vessel at all times remains the responsibility of the vessel owner, which is generally responsible for the vessel’s operating expenses, including the cost of crewing, insuring, repairing and maintaining the vessel, costs of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses.
     For the vessels that we employ on time charters and spot market-related time charters, agreements expire within a range of dates (for example, a minimum of 4 months and maximum of 6 months following delivery), with the exact end of the time charter left unspecified to account for the uncertainty of when a vessel will complete its final voyage 

 
  6

 
under the time charter.  The charterer may extend the charter period by any time that the vessel is off-hire.  If a vessel remains off-hire for more than 30 consecutive days, the time charter may be cancelled at the charterer’s option.
     In connection with the charter of each of our vessels, we incur commissions generally ranging from 1.25% to 6.25% of the total daily charterhire rate of each charter or total freight revenue to third-parties, depending on the number of brokers involved with arranging the relevant charter.
     We monitor developments in the drybulk shipping industry on a regular basis and strategically adjust the time and duration of employment for our vessels according to market conditions as they become available for hire.

      CLASSIFICATION AND INSPECTION
     All of our vessels have been certified as being “in class” by the American Bureau of Shipping (“ABS”), DNVGL or Lloyd’s Register of Shipping (“Lloyd’s”).  Each of these classification societies is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies.  Every commercial vessel’s hull and machinery is evaluated by a classification society authorized by its country of registry.  The classification society certifies that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel’s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member.  Each vessel is inspected by a surveyor of the classification society in three surveys of varying frequency and thoroughness: every year for the annual survey, every two to three years for the intermediate survey and every four to five years for special surveys.  Special surveys always require drydocking.  Vessels that are 15 years old or older are required, as part of the intermediate survey process, to be drydocked every 24 to 36 months for inspection of the underwater portions of the vessel and for necessary repairs stemming from the inspection.
     In addition to the classification inspections, many of our customers regularly inspect our vessels as a precondition to chartering them for voyages.  We believe that our well-maintained, high-quality vessels provide us with a competitive advantage in the current environment of increasing regulation and customer emphasis on quality.
     We have implemented the International Safety Management Code, which was promulgated by the International Maritime Organization, or IMO (the United Nations agency for maritime safety and the prevention of marine pollution by ships), to establish pollution prevention requirements applicable to vessels.  We obtained documents of compliance for our offices and safety management certificates for all of our vessels, which are required by the IMO.
     CREWING AND EMPLOYEES
     Each of our vessels is crewed with 21 to 24 officers and seamen.  We do not provide any seaborne personnel to crew our vessels.  Instead, our technical managers are responsible for locating and retaining qualified officers for our vessels.  The crewing agencies handle each seaman’s training, travel and payroll, and ensure that all the seamen on our vessels have the qualifications and licenses required to comply with international regulations and shipping conventions.  Our vessels are typically manned with more crew members than are required by the country of the vessel’s flag in order to allow for the performance of routine maintenance duties.
     As of February 28, 2018, we employed 35 shore-based personnel.  In addition, approximately 1,350 seagoing personnel were employed on our vessels.
     CUSTOMERS
     Our assessment of a charterer’s financial condition and reliability is an important factor in negotiating employment for our vessels.  We generally charter our vessels to major trading houses (including commodities traders), major producers and government-owned entities rather than to more speculative or undercapitalized entities.  Our 

 
  12

 
customers include national, regional and international companies, such as Cargill International S.A., Swissmarine, Pioneer Navigation Ltd. and Clipper. For the year ended December 31, 2017, two of our charterers, Swissmarine and Clipper, each accounted for more than 10% of our voyage revenue, or approximately 26%, in the aggregate.
     COMPETITION
     Our business fluctuates in line with the main patterns of trade of the major drybulk cargoes and varies according to changes in the supply and demand for these items.  We operate in markets that are highly competitive and based primarily on supply and demand.  We compete for charters on the basis of price, vessel location and size, age and condition of the vessel, as well as on our reputation as an owner and operator.  We compete with other owners of drybulk carriers in the Capesize, Panamax, Ultramax, Supramax, Handymax and Handysize class sectors, some of whom may also charter our vessels as customers.  Ownership of drybulk carriers is highly fragmented and is divided among approximately 1,936 independent drybulk carrier owners.     PERMITS AND AUTHORIZATIONS
     We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses, certificates and other authorizations with respect to our vessels.  The kinds of permits, licenses, certificates and other authorizations required for each vessel depend upon several factors, including the commodity transported, the waters in which the vessel operates, the nationality of the vessel’s crew and the age of the vessel.  We believe that we have all material permits, licenses, certificates and other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations.  However, additional laws and regulations, environmental or otherwise, may be adopted which could limit our ability to do business or increase the cost of our doing business.     INSURANCE
     General
     The operation of any drybulk vessel includes risks such as mechanical failure, collision, property loss, cargo loss or damage and business interruption due to political circumstances in foreign countries, piracy, hostilities and labor strikes.  In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of marine disaster, including oil spills and other environmental mishaps, and the liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels in international trade.  The United States (“U.S.”) Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, which imposes virtually unlimited liability upon owners, operators and demise charterers of vessels trading in the U.S.-exclusive economic zone for certain oil pollution accidents in the United States, has made liability insurance more expensive for ship owners and operators trading in the U.S. market.
     While we maintain hull and machinery insurance, war risks insurance, protection and indemnity cover, and freight, demurrage and defense cover and loss of hire insurance for our fleet in amounts that we believe to be prudent to cover normal risks in our operations, we may not be able to achieve or maintain this level of coverage throughout a vessel’s useful life.  Furthermore, while we believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate, not all risks can be insured, and there can be no guarantee that any specific claim will be paid, or that we will always be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates.
     Hull and Machinery, War Risks, Kidnap and Ransom Insurance
     We maintain marine hull and machinery, war risks and kidnap and ransom insurance which cover the risk of actual or constructive total loss, for all of our vessels.  Our vessels are each covered up to at least fair market value with deductibles, which depend primarily on the class of the insured vessel and are subject to change.  We are covered, subject to limitations in our policy, to have the crew released in the case of kidnapping due to piracy in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia.

 Protection and Indemnity Insurance
     Protection and indemnity insurance is provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations, or P&I Associations, which insure our third-party liabilities in connection with our shipping activities.  This includes third-party liability and other related expenses resulting from the injury or death of crew, passengers and other third parties, the loss or damage to cargo, claims arising from collisions with other vessels, damage to other third-party property, pollution arising from oil or other substances and salvage, towing and other related costs, including wreck removal.  Protection and indemnity insurance is a form of mutual indemnity insurance, extended by protection and indemnity mutual associations, or “clubs.” Subject to the “capping” discussed below, our coverage, except for pollution, is unlimited.
     We maintain protection and indemnity insurance coverage for pollution of $1 billion per vessel per incident.  The 13 P&I Associations that comprise the International Group insure approximately 90% of the world’s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association’s liabilities.  We are a member of P&I Associations, which are members of the International Group. As a result, we are subject to calls payable to the associations based on the group’s claim records as well as the claim records of all other members of the individual associations and members of the pool of P&I Associations comprising the International Group.
     Loss of Hire Insurance
     We maintain loss of hire insurance, which covers business interruptions and related losses that result from the loss of use of a vessel.  Our loss of hire insurance has a 14-day deductible and provides claim coverage for up to 90 days.     ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATION 
     Government regulation significantly affects the ownership and operation of our vessels.  We are subject to international conventions and treaties, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries in which our vessels may operate or are registered relating to safety and health and environmental protection including the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of hazardous and non-hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination and liability for damage to natural resources.  Compliance with such laws, regulations and other requirements entails significant expense, including vessel modifications and implementation of certain operating procedures.
     A variety of governmental and private entities subject our vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections.  These entities include the local port authorities, (applicable national authorities such as the U.S. Coast Guard (the “USCG”) and harbor masters), classification societies, flag state administrations (countries of registry) and charterers.  Some of these entities require us to obtain permits, licenses, certificates and other authorizations for the operation of our vessels.  Our failure to maintain necessary permits, licenses, certificates or authorizations could require us to incur substantial costs or temporarily suspend the operation of one or more of our vessels.
     In recent periods, heightened levels of environmental and operational safety concerns among insurance underwriters, regulators and charterers have led to greater inspection and safety requirements on all vessels and may accelerate the scrapping of older vessels throughout the drybulk shipping industry.  Increasing environmental concerns have created a demand for vessels that conform to the stricter environmental standards.  We believe that the operation of our vessels is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that our vessels have all material permits, licenses, certificates or other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations.  However, because such laws and regulations are frequently changed and may impose increasingly stricter requirements, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these requirements, or the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of our vessels.  In addition, a future serious marine incident, such as one comparable to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, that results in significant oil pollution or otherwise causes significant adverse environmental impact could result in additional legislation or regulation that could negatively affect our profitability.
     It should be noted that the U.S. is currently experiencing changes in its environmental policy, the results of which have yet to be fully determined.  For example, in April 2017, the U.S. President signed an executive order regarding environmental regulations, specifically targeting the U.S. offshore energy strategy, which may affect parts of 

 
  14

 
the maritime industry and our operations.  Furthermore, recent action by the IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee and United States agencies indicate that cybersecurity regulations for the maritime industry are likely to be further developed in the near future in an attempt to combat cybersecurity threats. For example, cyber-risk management systems must be incorporated by ship-owners and managers by 2021. This might cause companies to cultivate additional procedures for monitoring cybersecurity, which could require additional expenses and/or capital expenditures. However, the impact of such regulations is difficult to predict at this time.
     International Maritime Organization (IMO)
     The IMO has adopted the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto, collectively referred to as MARPOL 73/78 and herein as MARPOL, SOLAS and the International Convention on Load Lines of 1966 (the “MARPOL Convention”).  The MARPOL Convention establishes environmental standards relating to oil leakage or spilling, garbage management, sewage, air emissions, handling and disposal of noxious liquids and the handling of harmful substances in packaged forms.  MARPOL is applicable to drybulk, tanker and LPG carriers, among other vessels, and is broken into six Annexes, each of which regulates a different source of pollution. Annex I relates to oil leakage or spilling; Annexes II and III relate to harmful substances carried, in bulk, in liquid or packaged form, respectively; Annexes IV and V relate to sewage and garbage management, respectively; and Annex VI, lastly, relates to air emissions. Annex VI was separately adopted by the IMO in September of 1997.
     In 2013, the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (“MEPC”) adopted by resolution amendments to the MARPOL Annex I Condition Assessment Scheme (“CAS”). These amendments, which became effective on October 1, 2014, are intended to complement inspections for bulk carriers and tankers set forth in the 2011 International Code on the Enhanced Programme of Inspections during Surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers (“ESP Code”), and enhances the programs of inspections for certain tankers. We may need to make certain financial expenditures to comply with these amendments which we do not anticipate to be material.
     Air Emissions
     In September of 1997, the IMO adopted Annex VI to MARPOL to address air pollution from vessels.  Effective May 2005, Annex VI sets limits on sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from all commercial vessel exhausts and prohibits “deliberate emissions” of ozone depleting substances (such as halons and chlorofluorocarbons), emissions of volatile compounds from cargo tanks, and the shipboard incineration of specific substances.  Annex VI also includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for special areas to be established with more stringent controls on sulfur emissions, as explained below.  Emissions of “volatile organic compounds” from certain tankers, and the shipboard incineration (from incinerators installed after January 1, 2000) of certain substances (such as polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs) are also prohibited.  We believe that all of our vessels are currently compliant in all material respects with these regulations.
     The IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee (“MEPC”), adopted amendments to Annex VI regarding emissions of sulfur oxide, nitrogen oxide particulate matter and ozone depleting substances, which entered into force on July 1, 2010.  The amended Annex VI seeks to further reduce air pollution by, among other things, implementing a progressive reduction of the amount of sulfur contained in any fuel oil used on board ships.  On October 27, 2016, at its 70th session, the MEPC agreed to implement a global 0.5% m/m sulfur oxide emissions limit starting from January 1, 2020.  Under the new global cap, ships will have to use fuel oil on board with a sulfur content of no more than 0.50% m/m, against the current limit of 3.50%.  This limitation will require ships to use fuel oil on board with a sulfur content of no more than 0.5% m/m, which can be met by using low-sulfur complaint fuel oil, alternative fuels, or certain exhaust gas cleaning systems.  Once the cap becomes effective, ships will be required to obtain bunker delivery notes stating the sulfur content and International Air Pollution Prevention (“IAPP”) Certificates by their flag states.  This subjects ocean-going vessels in these areas to stringent emissions controls, and may cause us to incur additional costs. 
     Sulfur content standards are even stricter within certain “Emission Control Areas,” or (“ECAs”). As of January 1, 2015, ships operating within an ECA were not permitted to use fuel with sulfur content in excess of 0.1%.  Amended Annex VI establishes procedures for designating new ECAs. Currently, these areas include, but are not limited to, the 

 
  15

 
200 nautical miles extending from the Atlantic/Gulf and Pacific coasts of the U.S., Canada and the Hawaiian Islands, as well as applicable areas of the U.S. Caribbean Sea and Europe. Ocean-going vessels in these areas will be subject to stringent emission controls and may cause us to incur additional costs. If other ECAs are approved by the IMO, or other new or more stringent requirements relating to emissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or the states where we operate, compliance with these regulations could entail significant capital expenditures or otherwise increase the costs of our operations.
     Amended Annex VI also establishes new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for new marine engines, depending on their date of installation. At the MEPC meeting held in 2014, amendments to Annex VI were adopted which address the date on which Tier III Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) standards in ECAs will go into effect.  Under the amendments, Tier III NOx standards apply to ships that operate in North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea ECAs designed for the control of NOx with a marine diesel engine installed and constructed on or after January 1, 2016.  Tier III requirements could apply to areas that will be designated for Tier III NOx in the future. At MEPC 70 and MEPC 71, the MEPC approved the North Sea and Baltic Sea as ECAs for nitrogen oxide, effective January 1, 2021.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency promulgated equivalent (and in some senses stricter) emissions standards in late 2009.  As a result of these designations or similar future designations, we may be required to incur additional operating or other costs.
     As determined at the MEPC 70, the new Regulation 22A of MARPOL Annex VI will be effective on March 1, 2018 and will require ships above 5,000 gross tonnage to collect and report annual data on fuel oil consumption to an IMO database, with the first data calendar year beginning January 1, 2019.
     As of January 1, 2013, MARPOL made mandatory certain measures relating to energy efficiency for ships. Under these measures, by 2025 to 2030, all new ships built will be 30% more energy efficient in carbon dioxide emissions than those built in 2014. It makes the limits of the Energy Efficiency Design Index, or (“EEDI”), apply to new ships, and all ships must develop and implement Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans, or (“SEEMPs”).
     We may incur costs to comply with these revised standards. Additional or new conventions, laws and regulations may be adopted that could require the installation of expensive emission control systems and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
     Safety Management System Requirements
     The IMO also adopted the SOLAS Convention, and the International Convention on Load Lines (the “LL Convention”), which impose a variety of standards that regulate the design and operational features of ships.  The IMO periodically revises the SOLAS Convention and LL Convention standards.  The SOLAS Convention was amended in 2012 and 2013 to address the safe manning of vessels and emergency training drills.  The Convention of Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (the “LLMC”), was recently amended and the amendments went into effect on June 8, 2015. The amendments alter the limits of liability for a loss of life or personal injury claim or a property claim against ship owners.  We believe that all of our vessels are in substantial compliance with the SOLAS Convention and LL Convention standards.
     Under Chapter IX of the SOLAS Convention, the ISM Code, our operations are also subject to environmental standards and requirements.  The International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (“ISM Code”) requires the party with operational control of a vessel to develop an extensive safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for operating its vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies.  We rely upon the safety management system that we and our technical manager have developed for compliance with the ISM Code.  The failure of a vessel owner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM Code may subject such party to increased liability, may decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports.
     The ISM Code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate for each vessel they operate.  This certificate evidences compliance by a vessel’s management with the ISM Code requirements for a safety 

 
  16

 
management system.  No vessel can obtain a safety management certificate unless its manager has been awarded a document of compliance, issued by each flag state, under the ISM Code.  Our technical managers have valid documents of compliance and the safety management certificates are renewed as required after stringent audits by recognized organizations on behalf of the flag state.
     Noncompliance with the ISM Code or other IMO regulations may subject the ship owner or bareboat charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. The U.S. Coast Guard and European Union authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the ISM Code by the applicable deadlines will be prohibited from trading in U.S. and European Union ports, respectively. There can be no assurance that such certificates can be obtained or maintained.
     Pollution Control and Liability Requirements
     The IMO has negotiated international conventions that impose liability for pollution in international waters and the territorial waters of the signatories to such conventions.  For example, the IMO adopted an International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments, or the BWM Convention, in February 2004.  The BWM Convention’s implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements, to be replaced in time with mandatory concentration limits.  All ships will also have to carry a ballast water record book and an International Ballast Water Management Certificate.  The BWM Convention entered into force on September 9, 2017.  The BWM Convention requires ships to manage their ballast water to remove, render harmless, or avoid the uptake or discharge of new or invasive aquatic organisms and pathogens within ballast water and sediments.
      Many of the implementation dates in the BWM Convention have already passed, so now that the BWM Convention entered into force, the period of installation of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements would be extremely short, with several thousand ships a year needing to install ballast water management systems (“BWMS”). For this reason, on December 4, 2013, the IMO Assembly passed a resolution revising the application dates of the BWM Convention. This, in effect, makes all vessels constructed before the entry into force date “existing vessels” and allows for the installation of a BWMS on such vessels at the first renewal survey following entry into force of the convention. At MEPC 70, MEPC adopted updated guidelines for approval of ballast water management systems.  At MEPC 71, amendments to the schedule of certain BWM Convention implementation dates were introduced to extend the date existing vessels are subject to certain ballast water standards. Ships over 400 gross tons generally must comply with a “D-1 standard,” requiring the exchange of ballast water only in open seas and away from coastal waters. The “D-2 standard” specifies the maximum amount of viable organisms allowed to be discharged. Existing vessels must comply the D2 standard between September 8, 2019, and September 8, 2024. For most ships, compliance with the D2 standard will involve installing on-board systems to treat ballast water and eliminate unwanted organisms. 
     Once mid-ocean ballast exchange or ballast water treatment requirements become mandatory, the cost of compliance could increase for ocean carriers and the costs of ballast water treatments may be material.  It is difficult to predict the overall impact of such a requirement on our operations.  However, many countries already regulate the discharge of ballast water carried by vessels from country to country to prevent the introduction of invasive and harmful species via such discharges. The United States for example, requires vessels entering its waters from another country to conduct mid-ocean ballast exchange, or undertake some alternate measure, and to comply with certain reporting requirements.  The system specification requirements for trading in the U.S. have been formalized and we believe the ballast water treatment systems will range from $0.6 million to $1.0 million each, primarily dependent on the size of the vessel.
     The IMO adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969, as amended by different Protocols in 1976, 1984, and 1992, and amended in 2000 (the “CLC”). Under the CLC and depending on whether the country in which the damage results is a party to the 1992 Protocol to the CLC, a vessel’s registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The 1992 Protocol changed certain limits on liability, expressed using the International Monetary Fund currency unit of Special Drawing Rights. The limits on liability have since been amended so that the compensation limits on liability were raised. The right to limit liability is forfeited under 

 
  17

 
the CLC where the spill is caused by the ship owner’s actual fault and under the 1992 Protocol where the spill is caused by the ship owner’s intentional or reckless act or omission where the ship owner knew pollution damage would probably result. The CLC requires ships covered by it to maintain insurance covering the liability of the owner in a sum equivalent to an owner’s liability for a single incident. 
     The IMO also adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage of 2001 (the “Bunker Convention”), to impose strict liability on ship owners for pollution damage in jurisdictional waters of ratifying states caused by discharges of bunker fuel. The Bunker Convention requires registered owners of ships over 1,000 gross tons to maintain insurance for pollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime (but not exceeding the amount calculated in accordance with the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims of 1976, as amended). With respect to non-ratifying states, liability for spills or releases of oil carried as fuel in ship’s bunkers typically is determined by the national or other domestic laws in the jurisdiction where the events or damages occur.
     Anti-Fouling Requirements
     In 2001, the IMO adopted the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships (the “Anti-fouling Convention”).  The Anti-fouling Convention prohibits the use of organotin compound coatings to prevent the attachment of mollusks and other sea life to the hulls of vessels.  The exteriors of vessels constructed prior to January 1, 2003 that have not been in drydock must, as of September 17, 2008, either not contain the prohibited compounds or have coatings applied to the vessel exterior that act as a barrier to the leaching of the prohibited compounds.  Vessels of over 400 gross tons engaged in international voyages must obtain an International Anti-fouling System Certificate and undergo a survey before the vessel is put into service or when the anti-fouling systems are altered or replaced. We have obtained Anti-fouling System Certificates for all of our vessels that are subject to the Anti-fouling Convention.
     The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
     The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from oil spills.  OPA affects all “owners and operators” whose vessels trade in the U.S., its territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in U.S. waters, which includes the U.S. territorial sea and the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the U.S.  The U.S. has also enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) which applies to the discharge of hazardous substances other than oil, except in limited circumstances, whether on land or at sea.  OPA and CERCLA both define “owner or operator” “in the case of a vessel as any person owning, operating or chartering by demise, the vessel.”  Accordingly, both OPA and CERCLA impact our operations.
     Under OPA, vessel owners and operators are “responsible parties” and are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war) for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels.  OPA defines these other damages broadly to include:
    
· | injury to, destruction or loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources and related assessment costs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injury to, or economic losses resulting from, the destruction of real and personal property;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees or net profit revenues resulting from injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property or natural resources;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | loss of subsistence use of natural resources that are injured, destroyed or lost;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property or natural resources; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     
 
  18

 


· | net cost of increased or additional public services necessitated by removal activities following a discharge of oil, such as protection from fire, safety or health hazards, and loss of subsistence use of natural resources.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      OPA contains statutory caps on liability and damages; such caps do not apply to direct cleanup costs.  Effective December 21, 2015, the USCG adjusted the limits of OPA liability for non-tanker vessels, edible oil tank vessels, and any oil spill response vessels, to the greater of $1,100 per gross ton or $939,800 (subject to periodic adjustment for inflation).  These limits of liability do not apply if an incident was proximately caused by the violation of an applicable U.S. federal safety, construction or operating regulation by a responsible party (or its agent, employee or a person acting pursuant to a contractual relationship), or a responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The limitation on liability similarly does not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses to (i) report the incident where the responsibility party knows or has reason to know of the incident; (ii) reasonably cooperate and assist as requested in connection with oil removal activities; or (iii) without sufficient cause, comply with an order issued under the Federal Water Pollution Act (Section 311 (c), (e)) or the Intervention on the High Seas Act.
     CERCLA contains a similar liability regime whereby owners and operators of vessels are liable for cleanup, removal and remedial costs, as well as damage for injury to, or destruction or loss of, natural resources, including the reasonable costs associated with assessing same, and health assessments or health effects studies.  There is no liability if the discharge of a hazardous substance results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war.  Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5 million for vessels carrying a hazardous substance as cargo and the greater of $300 per gross ton or $500,000 for any other vessel.  These limits do not apply (rendering the responsible person liable for the total cost of response and damages) if the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance resulted from willful misconduct or negligence, or the primary cause of the release was a violation of applicable safety, construction or operating standards or regulations.  The limitation on liability also does not apply if the responsible person fails or refused to provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance as requested in connection with response activities where the vessel is subject to OPA.
     OPA and CERCLA each preserve the right to recover damages under existing law, including maritime tort law.
     OPA and CERCLA both require owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the USCG evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum amount of liability to which the particular responsible person may be subject. Vessel owners and operators may satisfy their financial responsibility obligations by providing a proof of insurance, a surety bond, qualification as a self-insurer or a guarantee. We are in compliance with the USCG’s financial responsibility regulations by providing a certificate of responsibility evidencing sufficient insurance.
     The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has resulted in additional regulatory initiatives or statutes, including the raising of liability caps under OPA.  For example, on February 24, 2014, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, proposed a rule increasing the limits of liability of damages for off-shore facilities under OPA based on inflation.  This rule became effective in January 2015.  Compliance with any new requirements of OPA may substantially impact our cost of operations or require us to incur additional expenses to comply with any new regulatory initiatives or statutes. In April 2015, it was announced that new regulations are expected to be imposed in the U.S. regarding offshore oil and gas drilling, and the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, BSEE, announced a new Well Control Rule in April 2016; however, pursuant to orders by the U.S. President in early 2017, BSEE announced in August 2017 that this rule would be revised.  In December 2015, the BSEE announced a new pilot inspection program for offshore facilities. Compliance with any new requirements of OPA may substantially impact our cost of operations or require us to incur additional expenses to comply with any new regulatory initiatives or statutes.  Additional legislation or regulations applicable to the operation of our vessels that may be implemented in the future could adversely affect our business.  In January 2018, the U.S. President proposed leasing new sections of U.S. waters to oil and gas companies for offshore drilling, vastly expanding the U.S. waters that are available for such activity over the next five years.  The effects of the proposal are currently unknown.
     While we do not carry oil as cargo, we do carry fuel and lube oil in our drybulk carriers.  We currently maintain pollution liability coverage insurance in the amount of $1 billion per incident for each of our vessels.  If the damages 

 
  19

 
from a catastrophic spill were to exceed our insurance coverage, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends.
     Other United States Environmental Regulations
     The U.S. Clean Water Act (“CWA”) prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances and ballast water in U.S. navigable waters unless authorized by a duly-issued permit or exemption, and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges.  The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under OPA and CERCLA.  In addition, many U.S. states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law.
     The EPA has enacted rules requiring a permit regulating ballast water discharges and other discharges incidental to the normal operation of certain vessels within U.S. waters under the Vessel General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal Operation of vessels (the “VGP”).  For a new vessel delivered to an owner or operator after September 19, 2009 to be covered by the VGP, the owner must submit a Notice of Intent (“NOI”) at least 30 days before the vessel operates in U.S. waters. On March 28, 2013, the EPA re-issued the VGP for another five years; this 2013 VGP took effect December 19, 2013.  The 2013 VGP contains numeric ballast water discharge limits for most vessels to reduce the risk of invasive species in U.S. waters, more stringent requirements for exhaust gas scrubbers and the use of environmentally acceptable lubricants.  We will submit NOIs for our vessels where required.
     USCG regulations adopted under the U.S. National Invasive Species Act (“NISA”) also impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks entering or operating in U.S. waters that require the installation of equipment to treat ballast water before it is discharged in U.S. waters or, in the alternative, the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures.  Vessels not complying with these regulations are restricted from entering.  As of June 21, 2012, the USCG implemented revised regulations on ballast water management by establishing standards on the allowable concentration of living organisms in ballast water discharged from ships in U.S. waters.  The USCG must approve any technology before it is placed on a vessel.
     As of January 1, 2014, vessels are technically subject to the phasing-in of these standards. However, it was not until December 2016 the USCG first approved said technology.  The USCG may also provide waivers to vessels that show why they cannot install the new technology. The EPA, on the other hand, has taken a different approach to enforcing ballast discharge standards under the VGP. On December 27, 2013, the EPA issued an enforcement response policy in connection with the new VGP in which the EPA indicated that it would take into account the reasons why vessels do not have the requisite technology installed, but will not grant any waivers.  In addition, through the CWA certification provisions that allow U.S. states to place additional conditions on the use of the VGP within state waters, a number of states have proposed or implemented a variety of stricter ballast requirements including, in some states, specific treatment standards.  Compliance with these USCG and state regulations could have an adverse impact on the commercial operation of our vessels.
     It should also be noted that in October 2015, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that directed the EPA to redraft the sections of the 2013 VGP that address ballast water. However, the Second Circuit stated that 2013 VGP will remain in effect until the EPA issues a new VGP. In the fall of 2016 sources reported that the EPA indicated it was working on a new VGP.  It presently remains unclear how the ballast water requirements set forth by the EPA, the USCG, and IMO BWM Convention, some of which are in effect and some which are pending, will co-exist.  On October 9, 2015, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the Waters of the United States rule (WOTUS), which aimed to expand the regulatory definition of “waters of the United States,” pending further action of the court.  In response, regulations have continued to be implemented as they were prior to the stay on a case-by-case basis.  On February 28, 2017, the U.S. President issued an executive order directing the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to review the WOTUS and publish a proposed rule rescinding or revising the rule.  The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers are currently in the process of rulemaking pursuant to the President’s order.  The effect of future actions in these cases upon our operations is unknown.

 The USCG’s revised ballast water standards are consistent with requirements under the BWM Convention. Compliance with the EPA and the USCG regulations could require the installation of equipment on our vessels to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures at potentially substantial cost, or may otherwise restrict our vessels from entering U.S. waters. In addition, certain states have enacted more stringent discharge standards as conditions to their required certification of the VGP.
     The U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, including its amendments of 1977 and 1990 (the “CAA”), requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants.  The CAA also requires states to draft State Implementation Plans (“SIPs”) designed to attain national health-based air quality standards in primarily major metropolitan areas and/or industrial areas.  To the extent applicable to our vessels, the operation of our vessels is in compliance with the CAA.
     European Union Regulations
     In October 2009, the EU amended a directive to impose criminal sanctions for illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances, including minor discharges, if committed with intent, recklessly or with serious negligence and the discharges individually or in the aggregate result in deterioration of the quality of water. Aiding and abetting the discharge of a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties. Member States were required to enact laws or regulations to comply with the directive by the end of 2010. Criminal liability for pollution may result in substantial penalties or fines and increased civil liability claims. The directive applies to all types of vessels, irrespective of their flag, but certain exceptions apply to warships or where human safety or that of the ship is in danger.
     The EU has implemented regulations requiring vessels to use reduced sulfur content fuel for their main and auxiliary engines. The EU Directive 2005/EC/33 (amending Directive 1999/32/EC) introduced requirements parallel to those in Annex VI relating to the sulfur content of marine fuels. In addition, the EU imposed a 0.1% maximum sulfur requirement for fuel used by ships at berth in EU ports, lasting until 2020.
     The EU has adopted several regulations and directives requiring, among other things, more frequent inspections of high-risk ships, as determined by type, age, and flag as well as the number of times the ship has been detained. The EU also adopted and then extended a ban on substandard ships and enacted a minimum ban period and a definitive ban for repeated offenses. The regulation also provided the EU with greater authority and control over classification societies by imposing more requirements on classification societies and providing for fines or penalty payments for organizations that failed to comply.
     Greenhouse Gas Regulation
     Currently, the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, which entered into force in 2005 and pursuant to which adopting countries have been required to implement national programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  International negotiations are continuing with respect to a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, which set emission reduction targets through 2012 and has been extended with new targets through 2020 pending negotiation of a new climate change treaty that would take effect in 2020.  Restrictions on shipping emissions may be included in any new treaty.  In December 2009, more than 27 nations, including the U.S. and China, signed the Copenhagen Accord, which includes a non-binding commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris resulted in the Paris Agreement, which entered into force on November 4, 2016.  The Paris Agreement does not directly limit greenhouse gas emissions from ships.  On June 1, 2017, the U.S. President announced that it is withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.  The timing and effect of such action has yet to be determined.

 At MEPC 70 and MEPC 71, a draft outline of the structure of the initial strategy for developing a comprehensive IMO strategy on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ships was approved. In accordance with this roadmap, initial IMO strategy for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions needs to be developed by MEPC 72, which will be held in April 2018.  The IMO may implement market-based mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships at the upcoming MEPC session.  
     On January 1, 2013, two new sets of mandatory requirements to address greenhouse gas emissions from ships adopted by the MEPC as amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, entered into force.  Currently operating ships are now required to develop and implement Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans, or SEEMPs, and the new ships to be designed in compliance with minimum energy efficiency levels per capacity mile as defined by the Energy Efficiency Design Index, or EEDI.  Under these measures, by 2025, all new ships built will be 25% more energy efficient than those built in 2014.  These requirements could cause us to incur additional compliance costs.  
     Starting in January 2018, large ships calling at European ports are required to collect and publish data on carbon dioxide omissions.  In June 2013, the European Commission developed a strategy to integrate maritime emissions into the overall EU strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For 2020, the EU made a unilateral commitment to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions from its member states from 20% of 1990 levels. The EU also committed to reduce its emissions by 20% under the Kyoto Protocol’s second period, from 2013 to 2020.  In December 2013, the EU environmental ministers discussed draft rules to implement monitoring and reporting of carbon dioxide emissions from ships. 
     In the U.S., the EPA has issued a final finding that greenhouse gases threaten public health and safety, and has adopted regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain mobile sources and proposed regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain large stationary sources. However, in April 2017, the U.S. President signed an executive order to review and possibly eliminate the EPA’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions.  Although the mobile source emission regulations do not apply to greenhouse gas emissions from vessels, the EPA or U.S. states could enact environmental regulations that would affect our operations.  For example, California has introduced caps for greenhouse gas emissions and, in the end of 2016, signalled it may take additional action regarding climate change.  In addition, the IMO is evaluating various mandatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping, including market-based instruments.  
     On June 29, 2017, the Global Industry Alliance, or GIA, was officially inaugurated. The GIA is a program, under the Global Environmental Facility-United Nations Development Program-IMO Project, which supports shipping, and related industries, as they move towards a low carbon future.  Organizations including, but not limited to, shipowners, operators, classification societies, and oil companies, signed to launch the GIA.
     Any passage of climate change legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the EU, U.S., IMO or other countries where we operate, or any treaty adopted at the international level to succeed the Kyoto Protocol or Paris Agreement, that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to make significant financial expenditures, including capital expenditures to upgrade our vessels that we cannot predict with certainty at this time.  Even in the absence of climate control legislation and regulations, our business may be materially affected to the extent that climate change may result in sea level changes or more intense weather events.
     International Labour Organization
     The International Labour Organization (ILO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, has adopted the Maritime Labor Convention 2006 (“MLC 2006”). A Maritime Labor Certificate and a Declaration of Maritime Labor Compliance is required to ensure compliance with the MLC 2006 for all ships above 500 gross tons in international trade. The MLC 2006 entered into force on August 20, 2013. Amendments to MLC 2006 were adopted in 2014 and 2016.  The MLC 2006 requires us to develop new procedures to ensure full compliance with its requirements.   All of our vessels are in compliance with and certified to meet MLC 2006.

 Vessel Security Regulations
     Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security, such as the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”).  To implement certain portions of the MTSA, the USCG issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. The regulations also impose requirements on certain ports and facilities, some of which are regulated by the EPA.
     Similarly, amendments to the SOLAS Convention created a new chapter of the convention dealing specifically with maritime security.  Chapter XI-2 became effective in July 2004 and imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities, and mandates compliance with the International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code (the “ISPS Code”).  The ISPS Code is designed to enhance the security of ports and ships against terrorism.  To trade internationally, a vessel must attain an International Ship Security Certificate (“ISSC”).  The following are among the various requirements, some of which are found in the SOLAS Convention:
    
· | on-board installation of automatic identification systems to provide a means for the automatic transmission of safety-related information from among similarly equipped ships and shore stations, including information on a ship’s identity, position, course, speed and navigational status;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | on-board installation of ship security alert systems, which do not sound on the vessel but only alert the authorities on shore;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the development of vessel security plans;
--+------------------------------------------


· | ship identification number to be permanently marked on a vessel’s hull;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a continuous synopsis record kept onboard showing a vessel’s history including the name of the ship, the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, the date on which the ship was registered with that state, the ship’s identification number, the port at which the ship is registered and the name of the registered owner(s) and their registered address; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | compliance with flag state security certification requirements.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

      A ship operating without a valid certificate may be detained at port until it obtains an ISSC, or may be expelled from port or refused entry at port.  Amendments to SOLAS Chapter VII, made mandatory in 2004, apply to vessels transporting dangerous goods and require those vessels be in compliance with the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, or IMDG Code. Starting in January 1, 2016, the IMDG Code also includes updates to the provisions for radioactive material, reflecting the latest ﴾2012﴿ provisions from the International Atomic Energy Agency ﴾IAEA﴿, new marking requirements for “overpack” and “salvage” and updates to various individual packing requirements. The IMO has also adopted the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, or STCW. The STCW had a transitional period which ended on January 1, 2017 and which mandated certain requirements for security training, and certifications. Flag states that have ratified the SOLAS Convention and STCW generally employ the classification societies, which have incorporated the SOLAS Convention and STCW requirements into their class rules, to undertake surveys to confirm compliance.
     The USCG regulations, intended to align with international maritime security standards, exempt from MTSA vessel security measures non-U.S. vessels that have on board, as of July 1, 2004, a valid ISSC attesting to the vessel’s compliance with the SOLAS Convention security requirements and the ISPS Code.  We have implemented the various security measures addressed by the MTSA, the SOLAS Convention and the ISPS Code.
     Inspection by Classification Societies
     Every oceangoing vessel must be ‘‘classed’’ by a classification society.  The classification society certifies that the vessel is ‘‘in class,’’ signifying that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the 

 
  23

 
classification society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel’s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member.  In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the classification society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned.
     The classification society also undertakes on request other surveys and checks that are required by regulations and requirements of the flag state.  These surveys are subject to agreements made in each individual case and/or to the regulations of the country concerned.
     For maintenance of the class certification, regular and extraordinary surveys of hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and any special equipment classes are required to be performed as follows:
    
· | Annual Surveys: For seagoing ships, annual surveys are conducted for the hull and the machinery, including the electrical plant, and where applicable for special equipment classed, within three months before or after each anniversary date of the date of commencement of the class period indicated in the certificate. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Intermediate Surveys: Extended annual surveys are referred to as intermediate surveys and typically are conducted two and one-half years after commissioning and each class renewal. Intermediate surveys are to be carried out at or between the occasion of the second or third annual survey. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Class Renewal Surveys: Class renewal surveys, also known as special surveys, are carried out for the ship’s hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and for any special equipment classed, at the intervals indicated by the character of classification for the hull. At the special survey, the vessel is thoroughly examined, including audio-gauging to determine the thickness of the steel structures. Should the thickness be found to be less than class requirements, the classification society would prescribe steel renewals. Substantial amounts of money may have to be spent for steel renewals to pass a special survey if the vessel experiences excessive wear and tear. In lieu of the special survey every four or five years, depending on whether a grace period was granted, a vessel owner has the option of arranging with the classification society for the vessel’s hull or machinery to be on a continuous survey cycle, in which every part of the vessel would be surveyed within a five-year cycle. Upon a vessel owner’s request, the surveys required for class renewal may be split according to an agreed schedule to extend over the entire period of class. This process is referred to as continuous class renewal. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      All areas subject to survey as defined by the classification society are required to be surveyed at least once per class period, unless shorter intervals between surveys are prescribed elsewhere.  The period between two subsequent surveys of each area must not exceed five years.
     Most vessels are also drydocked every 30 to 36 months for inspection of the underwater parts and for repairs related to inspections.  If any defects are found, the classification surveyor will issue a “recommendation,” which must be rectified by the vessel owner within prescribed time limits.  Vessels under 15 years of age can extend the dry docking cycle up to 60 months in order to increase available days and decrease capital expenditures, provided that the vessel is inspected underwater. If any defects are found, the classification surveyor will issue a “recommendation” which must be rectified by the ship owner within prescribed time limits.
     Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage that a vessel be certified as “in class” by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies (“IACS”).  In December 2013, the IACS adopted new harmonized Common Structural Rules, which apply to oil tankers and bulk carriers constructed on or after July 1, 2015.  All of our vessels have been certified as being “in class” by ABS, DNVGL or Lloyd’s.  All new and secondhand vessels that we purchase must be certified prior to their delivery under our standard agreements.

 SEASONALITY
     We operate our vessels in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand and, as a result, freight and charter rates.  We seek to mitigate the risk of these seasonal variations by entering into long-term time charters for our vessels, where possible.  However, this seasonality may result in quarter-to-quarter volatility in our operating results, depending on when we enter into our time charters or if our vessels trade on the spot market.  The drybulk sector is typically stronger in the fall and winter months in anticipation of increased consumption of coal and raw materials in the northern hemisphere during the winter months.  As a result, our revenues could be weaker during the fiscal quarters ended June 30 and September 30, and conversely, our revenues could be stronger during the quarters ended December 31 and March 31.
