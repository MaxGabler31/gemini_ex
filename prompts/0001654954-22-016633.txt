Item 1. BUSINESS.
Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative ways to treat inflammatory and immune-related diseases.

Our approach is to acquire, develop and commercialize drug candidates based on mechanisms of action that have demonstrated proof-of-concept in human subjects. We prioritize our efforts on disease indications where there is compelling scientific rationale, no approved therapies or where there are unmet medical needs, and where there are large addressable market opportunities, among other factors. We have multiple late-stage product candidates in our development pipeline.

Our most advanced drug candidate is EB05, a monoclonal antibody developed for acute and chronic disease indications that involve dysregulated innate immunity responses. EB05 inhibits toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a key immune signaling protein and an important mediator of inflammation. We are currently evaluating EB05 as a potential treatment for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a life-threatening form of respiratory failure. In September 2022, we reported final results from the Phase 2 part of a Phase 2/Phase 3 study of EB05 in ARDS patients who were hospitalized for Covid-19-related respiratory disease. Among the findings, EB05 demonstrated statistically significant mortality reductions in critically ill hospitalized patients treated with EB05 plus Standard of Care treatment (SOC). We are currently enrolling patients in the Phase 3 part of the EB05 study. 

In addition to EB05, we are developing product candidates for a number of chronic dermatological and inflammatory conditions. We recently completed enrollment of a Phase 2b study of our EB01 drug candidate in moderate-to-severe chronic Allergic Contact Dermatitis (ACD), a common occupational and work-related skin condition. We are also preparing an investigational new drug application (IND) in the United States for our EB07 product candidate to conduct a future Phase 2 study in systemic sclerosis (SSc), an autoimmune rheumatic disorder that causes fibrosis (scarring/hardening) of skin and internal organs. In Canada, we are preparing a clinical trial application (CTA) for our EB06 monoclonal antibody candidate to conduct a future Phase 2 study in vitiligo, a common autoimmune disorder that causes the skin to lose its color in patches.

Competitive Strengths

We believe that we possess a number of competitive strengths that position us to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on inflammatory and immune-related diseases, including:

· | Validated technology and drug development capabilities. We believe that the strength of our technologies has been validated by our favorable clinical data and progress, $11 million competitive grant award, and our multiple arrangements with third parties to develop and commercialize their clinical-stage drug candidates. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Innovative pipeline addressing large underserved markets. Our product candidates include novel clinical-stage compounds and antibodies that have significant scientific rationale for effectiveness. By initially targeting large markets that have significant unmet medical needs, we believe that we can drive adoption of new products and improve our competitive position. For example, ARDS is associated with approximately 10% of all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, impacts millions of people, and costs billions of dollars annually. 
· | Intellectual property protection and market exclusivity. We have opportunities to develop our competitive position through patents, trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation. We have exclusive license rights in our target indications to multiple patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. In addition to patent protection, we intend to utilize trade secrets and market exclusivity afforded to a New Chemical Entity, where applicable, to enhance or maintain our competitive position. 
· | Experienced leadership. Our leadership team possesses core capabilities in dermatology, infectious diseases, gastrointestinal medicine, drug development and commercialization, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and finance. Our founder, Chief Executive Officer, Pardeep Nijhawan, MD, FRCPC, AGAF, is a board-certified gastroenterologist and hepatologist with a successful track record of building life science businesses, including Exzell Pharma Inc., which was sold to BioLab Pharma in 2022, and Medical Futures, Inc., which was sold to Tribute Pharmaceuticals in 2015. In addition to our internal capabilities, we have also established a network of key opinion leaders, contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations and consultants. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to efficiently develop novel treatments for inflammatory and immune-related diseases.

Our Business Strategy

Our business strategy is to develop and commercialize innovative drug products that address unmet medical needs for large, underserved markets with limited competition. Key elements of our strategy include:

· | Prioritize the development and commercialization of later-stage product candidates. Our goal is to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize multiple clinical assets in our pipeline, beginning with our two most advanced product candidates, EB05 and EB01. We seek to expedite development, in part, through the use of innovative trial designs, including adaptive design protocols, as well as by focusing on disease indications that we believe have clear regulatory pathways and interest from potential licensing or development partners. We also plan to evaluate opportunities to apply, as applicable, for expedited regulatory review and orphan drug programs, which could potentially lead to accelerated clinical development and commercialization timelines for our product candidates.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Maximize our current portfolio opportunity by expanding use across multiple indications. We aim to identify clinical-stage assets that have the potential to treat multiple diseases. Our assets are designed to modulate pathways that are implicated across a number of immune and inflammatory/allergic conditions. For example, we believe that our monoclonal antibody candidates have potential utility in additional indications, including chronic conditions like systemic sclerosis (SSc) and vitiligo. 
· | Maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates via direct marketing or strategic arrangements. If our product candidates are successfully developed and approved, we plan to either build commercial infrastructure capable of directly marketing the products, or alternatively, outsource the sales and marketing of our products. We also plan to evaluate strategic licensing or partnering arrangements with pharmaceutical companies for the further development or commercialization of our drugs, where applicable, such as in areas or regions outside North America where a partner may contribute additional resources, infrastructure and expertise. 
· | In-license promising product candidates. We are applying our cost-effective development approach to advance and expand our pipeline. Our current product candidates are in-licensed from academic institutions or other biopharmaceutical companies, and, from time to time, we plan to identify, evaluate and potentially obtain rights to and develop additional assets. Our objective is to maintain a well-balanced portfolio with product candidates across various stages of development. We do not currently intend to invest significant capital in basic research, which can be expensive and time-consuming. 

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome 

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening form of respiratory failure characterized by an exaggerated and dysfunctional immune response, rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs, and hypoxia (an absence of enough oxygen in the tissues to sustain bodily functions). ARDS can be precipitated by a number of conditions including viral and bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, chest injury and even mechanical ventilation, among other causes. Prior to Covid-19, ARDS accounted for 10% of intensive care unit admissions, representing more than 3 million patients globally each year. Based on the prevalence data of ARDS, we estimate that there are as many as 600,000 ARDS-related admissions to Intensive Care Units (ICUs) each year in the seven major markets (US, UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Japan) and Canada. This estimate does not account for Covid-19-related hospitalizations, which we believe will continue to add to ARDS cases as the virus becomes endemic and more seasonal like influenza. According to medical literature, ICU stays for ARDS patients in the U.S. range from 7 to 21 days on average, at an average cost of more than $100,000 per patient.

For moderate to severe cases of ARDS, treatments remain limited and patients suffer high mortality rates. Countering the exaggerated innate immune response in ARDS patients has been a key area of interest among researchers. One of the most studied targets has been Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) - a key component of the innate immune system and an important mediator of inflammation. Since TLR4 detects molecules found in pathogens and also binds to endogenous molecules produced as a result of injury, it is a key receptor on which both infectious and noninfectious stimuli converge to induce a proinflammatory response. Specifically, TLR4 signaling activates leukocytes to secrete proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., CXCL10, IL-6, IFN-b, IL-1b, TNF-α), which under certain circumstances can result in a “cytokine storm” - a severe immune reaction in which the body releases too many cytokines into the blood too quickly.

Such upregulation of TLR4 and its associated cytokines has been observed in respiratory infections such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. In multiple third-party studies, high serum levels of alarmins, such as calprotectin (S100A8/A9) and HMGB1(high mobility group protein B1), that bind to and activate TLR4 are associated with poor outcomes and disease progression in ARDS patients. In addition, TLR4 inhibition (antagonism) prevents cytokine production at a very early stage and has been shown to have a protective effect. For example, in preclinical studies in mice, it was demonstrated that administration of a TLR4 antagonist blocked influenza-induced lethality and ameliorated virus-induced acute lung injury. Antagonism of TLR4 has also been shown to modulate the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, CRP, IFNb, TNF-a, CXCL-10, IL8 and MIP-1b). Based on these data as well as previous clinical results, we believe that the modulation of TLR4 provides a compelling opportunity to treat ARDS.

EB05

Overview

EB05 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody (mAb) that has been engineered to alter inflammatory signaling by binding to and blocking the activation of TLR4. Specifically, EB05 dampens TLR4 signaling by blocking receptor dimerization (and subsequent intracellular signaling cascades). The drug has demonstrated the ability to block signaling irrespective of the presence or concentration of the various molecules that frequently bind with TLR4, known as ligands. Based on this broad mechanism of action, we believe that EB05 could ameliorate TLR4-mediated inflammation cascades in ARDS patients, thereby reducing lung injury, ventilation rates and mortality. 
Phase 2 Results of Phase 2/Phase 3 Study

In September 2022, we reported final results for the Phase 2 part of an international Phase 2/3 clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of EB05 as a therapy for adult hospitalized Covid-19 patients. 

The Phase 2 part of the Phase 2/3 study was primarily exploratory and designed to refine patient stratification and statistical powering for the Phase 3 study. All levels of hospitalized Covid-19 patients were enrolled, ranging from Level 3 (hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen) on the nine-point WHO Covid-19 Severity Scale (WCSS) to WCSS Level 7 (hospitalized, requiring intubation plus additional organ support such as ECMO). Enrollment in the study as well as the analysis was stratified according to baseline WCSS level into patients with mild Covid-19, defined as WCSS level ≤4, or severe Covid-19, defined as WCSS level ≥5. Following a single intravenous infusion of EB05 or placebo, patients were evaluated for disease progression, mortality, side effects and other critical care measurements. Standard-of-care Covid-19 treatment is given to all patients.

In the Phase 2 study, EB05 demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful trend for mortality and survival time for all randomized subjects in the critically ill cohort (the intent to treat, or ITT, population). The 28-day death rate in the EB05 plus standard of care (SOC) arm was 7.7% versus 40% in the placebo + SOC arm in critically severe patients on ECMO therapy (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) or Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV) plus organ support with ARDS at baseline (p=0.04). The Survival Analysis using Cox’s Proportional Hazard Model demonstrated that patients treated with EB05 + SOC had an 84% reduction in the risk of dying when compared to placebo + SOC at 28 days. To our knowledge, no other study has demonstrated a result of this magnitude in this population. The 60-day mortality rate was 23.1% (3/13) in the EB05 + SOC arm versus 45% (9/20) in the placebo + SOC arm for this same population (p=0.20). The Survival Analysis using Cox’s Proportional Hazard Model showed that the patients treated with EB05 + SOC had a 61% reduction in the risk of dying when compared to placebo + SOC at 60 days. 

In addition to the critically ill population, the analysis of the full Phase 2 dataset revealed other efficacy signals. For severe Covid-19 patients at WCSS Level ≥5 (99% of patients had ARDS at baseline), there were clinically meaningful differences with respect to the proportion of patients who were alive without any need for oxygen support at Day 28 (the Phase 2 study’s primary endpoint). From the ITT analysis of this population, 45.8% in the EB05 + SOC arm versus 36.1% in the placebo + SOC arm achieved the primary endpoint (p=0.16). Similarly positive efficacy signals were also demonstrated in this same population for the proportion of patients who achieved at least a 2-point improvement on the WCSS. From the ITT analysis of this population, 46.7% in the EB05 + SOC arm versus 36.1% in the placebo + SOC arm achieved at least a 2-point improvement in on the WCSS (p=0.12). For mild Covid-19 patients at WCSS Level ≤4, the study did not detect meaningful clinical differences between the arms for these endpoints, which is likely the result of the baseline severity score being too close to the endpoint (WCSS of 3 or less) on these scoring scales. The Phase 2 study demonstrated that EB05 was well-tolerated and consistent with the observed safety profile to date.

Phase 3 of a Phase 2/Phase 3 Study

The Phase 3 part of our Phase 2/3 study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of EB05 among hospitalized patients with severe and critical disease, for whom there continues to be limited treatment options and high mortality rates. The Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study design has been approved in Canada, Colombia, Poland, where recruitment is ongoing. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently reviewing our Phase 3 study design. We intend to harmonize the study protocol, where appropriate, across jurisdictions once we reach agreement with the FDA on the study design.

Previous Phase 1 and Phase 2 Clinical Studies of EB05

EB05 has demonstrated the ability to regulate inflammation and resolve fever and stabilize heart and breathing rates in human subjects that were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - a potent inducer of acute systemic inflammation. In previous Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies, EB05 has demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability profiles.

In a previous Phase 1 study, EB05 was administered in healthy volunteers (HV) as a single intravenous infusion using a single ascending pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic dose design. EB05 was administered at different dose levels and was followed by in vivo LPS challenges. The study demonstrated that EB05 inhibited the release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-6, TNF-α and CXCL10) as well as stabilized certain other vital signs for up to 22 days after the infusion of EB05. The study further demonstrated that cytokine response and baseline vital signs were restored at 40 days after EB05 infusion.

EB05 demonstrated a favorable safety profile in the Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers as well as a multiple-infusion Phase 2 study in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the Phase 1 study, doses ranged from 0.001 mg/kg up to 15mg/kg. The Phase 2 RA study was a multiple dose study where patients received one dose of EB05 5 mg/kg every two weeks for 12 weeks. In the Phase 1 study, a total of 60 subjects received EB05, and in the Phase 2 RA study, 61 patients were randomized to the EB05 group. There were no meaningful differences observed between the placebo and EB05 treatment groups with respect to the incidence of treatment emergent serious and non-serious adverse events in either of these studies.

Federal Reimbursement Grant from the Canadian Government

In February 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary Edesa Biotech Research, Inc. entered into a multi-year contribution agreement with the Canadian government’s Strategic Innovation Fund, or SIF. Under this agreement, the Government of Canada committed up to C$14.05 million ($11 million) in nonrepayable funding toward (i) the Phase 2 portion of our ongoing Phase 2/3 study of our investigation therapy EB05 in hospitalized Covid-19 patients, and (ii) certain pre-clinical research intended to potentially broaden the application of our experimental therapy. In the event that we breach our obligations under the agreement, subject to applicable cure, the SIF may exercise a number of remedies, including suspending or terminating funding under the Agreement, demanding repayment of funding previously received and/or terminating the Agreement. The performance obligations of Edesa Biotech Research under the contribution agreement are guaranteed by the Company. As of the date of this filing, we have met all of our performance and reporting requirements under the grant agreement.
Allergic Contact Dermatitis

Contact dermatitis is a common occupational and work-related skin condition. The disease can be either irritant contact dermatitis or ACD. Based on market research, we believe that together these conditions cost up to $2 billion annually in the United States as a result of lost work, reduced productivity, medical care and disability payments. Based on the prevalence data of contact allergy in the general population, which we sourced from scientific literature and market reports, we estimate that there are as many as 30 million people in the seven major markets (US, UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Japan) and Canada with ACD, and of these, we estimate that 40% have chronic exposure or frequent recurring exposure to a causative allergen. Based on the mechanism of action and topical delivery, we believe that the total addressable patient population for EB01 is as high as five million people in the seven major markets and Canada.

ACD is caused by an allergen interacting with skin and usually occurs on areas of the body that have been directly exposed to the environment, with a high prevalence on the hands and face. Common allergens associated with ACD include plants, metals, plastics and resins, rubber additives, dyes, biocides, and various cosmetics. The disease is characterized by inflammation, erythema (redness), pruritus (itchiness), and blistering of the skin. Inflammation can vary from mild irritation and redness to open sores, depending on the type of irritant, the body part affected and the degree of sensitivity. ACD can become chronic if not treated or if the causative allergen is not removed. In many chronic cases, the causative allergen is unknown or difficult to avoid (as an example, the allergen is present in the workplace).


7


The immune mechanisms involved in ACD are well documented. During the initial contact with the offending allergen, the immune system is sensitized. Upon subsequent contact, a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (Type IV) occurs at the point of contact between the skin and the allergen. As a cell-mediated response, the immune reaction primarily involves the interaction of T cells with antigens rather than an antibody response. More specifically, ACD involves an exogenous substance binding a cell surface protein to form a hapten that is recognized as a foreign antigen by the immune system. Haptens are known to signal through toll-like receptors, a family of receptors involved in the innate immune system, which leads to the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1b. EB01 has been shown in preclinical studies to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced via toll-like receptor signaling (IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1a, and TNF-α), suggesting that EB01 may address the underlying disease mechanism of ACD.

Generally, dermatologists view chronic ACD from both a duration and recurrence perspective, considering how often and how long symptoms persist. Chronic disease affects patients over a prolonged period, typically greater than six months or even years. These chronic patients have either frequent intermittent exposure or continuous exposure. Since inflammation in ACD is driven by external exposure to an allergen, the severity of ACD does not necessarily correlate with body surface area, as is often the case with other dermatological diseases.

Current treatment plans begin by attempting to identify and remove exposure to the causative allergen. However, the causative allergen(s) is frequently not identified, and even when it is, avoiding exposure is often not possible (e.g., it is present in the workplace), according to our market research. To our knowledge, there are no drug treatment options specifically indicated for ACD. As such, physicians must utilize agents approved for other dermatological conditions. Topical corticosteroids are the most commonly used therapeutic intervention for ACD but cannot be used continuously since they have well-known side-effects including skin thinning, stretch marks, acne, stinging, burning and dryness. Other topical treatments for ACD include topical immunomodulators such as topical calcineurin inhibitors. However, these are less efficacious than topical corticosteroids and have an FDA “black box warning” for risk of malignancies. Systemic corticosteroids can be used for acute control of severe cases of ACD but have safety concerns including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, growth suppression and loss of bone-density, thereby limiting the utility of steroids for treating chronic disease. Finally, patients may be treated with systemic immunomodulators, which have “black box warnings” and associated safety issues. Systemic therapies also need to be tapered off each time the physician wants to patch test allergens to identify the source of a patient’s ACD.

EB01

Overview and Status

EB01 is a potential first-in-class, topical vanishing cream containing a novel, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound. EB01 exerts its anti-inflammatory activity through the inhibition of certain pro-inflammatory enzymes known as secretory phospholipase 2, or sPLA2. These enzymes are secreted by immune cells upon their activation and produce arachidonic acid via phospholipid hydrolysis, which, in turn, initiates a broad inflammatory cascade. The sPLA2 enzyme family plays a key role in initiating inflammation associated with many diseases, and we believe that targeting the sPLA2 enzyme family with enzyme inhibitors will have a superior anti-inflammatory therapeutic effect because the inflammatory process will be inhibited at its inception rather than after inflammation has occurred.

In September 2022, we completed enrollment in a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled confirmatory Phase 2b study evaluating the safety and efficacy of various concentrations of EB01 cream in approximately 210 subjects. We anticipate that preliminary topline results will be available by mid-January 2023. A voluntary 90-day open-label extension with EB01 cream is also available for study patients once they complete their treatment in the main study. 

Previous Clinical Results of EB01

EB01 has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of ACD in two separate clinical trials. Both studies were double-blind, placebo/vehicle-controlled bilateral comparison studies to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of EB01 cream applied twice daily for the treatment of ACD of the hand and forearm as determined by the Contact Dermatitis Severity Index (CDSI), a physician’s visual assessment. The CDSI is a composite endpoint, which grades each symptom of the disease (dryness, scaling, redness, pruritus, and fissures) scored from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), with a maximum total severity score of 15. A diagnosis of ACD was confirmed by a positive patch test deemed to be clinically relevant by the investigator.

The first study (n=11) was a double-blind, placebo/vehicle-controlled clinical study to assess the safety and efficacy of topical 1% EB01 cream for the treatment of ACD. Subjects selected for inclusion had bilateral ACD. Prior to randomization, subjects were patch tested. The study was bilateral in design with one lesion treated with 1% EB01 cream twice daily, while a comparable lesion was treated with placebo cream. Disease severity was assessed before treatment (Day 0) and at Day 30 by the investigator using the CDSI. For each individual patient, the change in disease score in the drug-treated hand was compared to that in the placebo-treated hand, thus making the latter an internal control for each patient. The mean change from baseline for 1% EB01 cream treated lesions was 69.9%, compared to 36.5% in the placebo cream lesions (p=0.0024). 


8


A second, larger (n=30) bilateral study was conducted to assess 2% EB01 cream applied twice daily for 21 consecutive days in connection with the treatment of ACD. To be included in the study, patients had to have bilateral ACD with a CDSI score of at least 10 on each side, with no more than a 1-point difference between lesions. At Day 21, EB01-treated lesions had a mean improvement from baseline of 56%, compared to 24% for those treated with placebo cream (p<0.001). Efficacy of the 2% EB01 cream was maintained through Day 42 (21-days after ending treatment) with a 49% decrease in total CDSI score for 2% EB01 cream-treated hands, compared to 15% in the placebo/vehicle-treated hands (p<0.001). Within the total CDSI score, EB01 demonstrated statistically significant reductions for each of the individual CDSI components (dryness, scaling, redness, pruritus, and fissures).

Total clinical experience with EB01, including the current Phase 2b study, has involved approximately 270 subjects. No serious adverse events have been encountered to date. 

Pre-Clinical Results

EB01 has demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity in a variety of in vitro and in vivo preclinical pharmacology models. Using a model for hapten signaling indicative of ACD, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with EB01 and shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1a, and TNF-α at the protein and mRNA expression levels. Additionally, the safety of EB01 has been established in several Good Laboratory Practice toxicology studies. Overall, EB01 was well-tolerated and systemic exposure was negligible (below the limit of detection). No genotoxicity was demonstrated in bacterial reverse mutation and micronucleus testing.

Hemorrhoids Disease

Hemorrhoids Disease (HD) is a common disorder, characterized by itching, inflammation, pain, tenderness, bleeding and difficulty defecating. According to National Institutes of Health reports, HD affects approximately 5% of the U.S. adult population, or approximately 12.5 million adults in the U.S. Almost half of individuals 50 years and older have experienced symptomatic hemorrhoids. Despite the high prevalence of hemorrhoids, we are not aware of any prescription drugs with an approved New Drug Application for the treatment of hemorrhoids. While there are commonly used prescription and over-the- counter products for HD, none has been approved by the FDA through the NDA process because they entered the market prior to 1962. The mechanism of action of these treatments is either general, such as steroids, or unknown, in the case of herbal remedies, and we are not aware of any reports published in medical journals on the efficacy or safety of any product currently marketed in the U.S. As a result of these factors, we believe that HD remains a significant unmet medical need and market opportunity.

Confusion often arises because the term hemorrhoid has been used to refer to both normal anatomic structures and pathologic structures. Hemorrhoids are cushions of fibromuscular tissue that line the anal canal. With HD, the muscle fibers that anchor the cushions become attenuated, the hemorrhoids slide, become congested, bleed, and eventually prolapse or protrude into the anal canal. The two types of hemorrhoids, external and internal, refer to their location. Internal hemorrhoids are typically classified as first degree (grade I) - hemorrhoids bleed but do not protrude; second degree (grade II) - hemorrhoids protrude but reduce on their own; third degree (grade III) - hemorrhoids protrude and require manual re-insertion; and fourth degree (grade IV) - hemorrhoids are permanently prolapsed and cannot be re-inserted.

The treatment of HD typically begins with conservative therapy consisting of diet and lifestyle modification, fiber supplements, sitz baths and stool softeners. In addition to this conservative therapy, physicians may prescribe topical steroids and analgesics. Because of the lack of effective prescription products, most hemorrhoid patients will use over-the-counter preparations or the prescription drugs available, which are similar to the over-the-counter treatment, but formulated with a higher dose. Based on public filings and reports, we estimate that as many as 4 million prescriptions are written and more than 20 million over-the-counter units are sold each year in the U.S. for the treatment of HD. Alternatives are invasive procedures, including rubber band ligation, the injection of a sclerosing agent, electrocoagulation, light therapy and hemorrhoidectomy.

EB02

Overview and Status

Our EB02 drug candidate represents a potential extension of our sPLA2 anti-inflammatory technology. Based on our analysis of clinical data in dermatitis, we believe that EB02, which is currently formulated as a cream, may be effective in treating the erythema, swelling and exudation associated with HD. Specifically, sPLA2 has been demonstrated to be a mediator of processes that characterize hemorrhoidal pathophysiology, including inflammation and micro-vascularization. In September 2019, we received approval from Health Canada to begin a clinical study of EB02 as a potential treatment for patients with grade I-III internal hemorrhoids. Our exploratory Phase 2a study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of EB02 among hemorrhoid patients at investigational centers in Canada. The study plan includes up to 48 subjects in a randomized, double- blind, vehicle-controlled design. Should the initial results be encouraging, we plan to transition from a proof-of-concept study to a Phase 2 study of up to 80 to 400 subjects. In light of our focus on the development of EB05 and EB01, we are currently evaluating the timing for the initiation of this planned study of EB02.
Other Future Product Candidates

We are seeking to advance additional product candidates as well as add new disease indications for current product candidates, and from time to time we may request approval from regulators in various jurisdictions to initiate new clinical studies or amend the scope of current clinical studies. In addition, we plan to continue to identify, evaluate and potentially obtain rights to and develop additional clinical assets across various stages of development, focusing primarily on inflammatory and immune-related diseases.

Among our activities, we are preparing an investigational new drug application (IND) in the United States for our EB07 product candidate to conduct a future study in systemic sclerosis (SSc), an autoimmune rheumatic disorder that causes fibrosis, (scarring/hardening) of skin and internal organs such as the lungs, heart and kidneys. This project represents a potential additional use for our anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibody candidate in a chronic orphan disease with limited treatment options and high mortality and morbidity. We are also preparing a clinical trial application (CTA) in Canada for our EB06 product candidate to conduct a future study in vitiligo, a common autoimmune disorder that causes the skin to lose its color in patches. EB06 is a monoclonal antibody candidate that binds specifically and selectively to chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) and inhibits the interaction of CXCL10 with its receptor(s). We believe that there is significant scientific rationale for the potential utility of this mechanism of action to reduce disease symptoms and progression in vitiligo patients. Initiating recruitment in the EB07 or EB06 studies is subject to, among other limitations, regulatory approval of the respective applications.

Intellectual Property and Key Licenses 

We have an exclusive license from Yissum Research Development Company, the technology transfer company of Hebrew University of Jerusalem Ltd. (Yissum), for patents and patent applications that cover our product candidates EB01 and EB02 in the United States, Canada, Australia and various countries in Europe. Method of use patents, for which we hold an inbound license from Yissum and an affiliate of Yissum, have been issued for use in dermatologic and gastrointestinal conditions and infections that will expire in 2024. We expect to seek patent term extension in the United States related to time under IND, which could add up to three to five years of additional protection. Additional patents subject to the license agreement have been filed by Yissum which we believe, if issued, could potentially prevent generic substitution until after 2033. 

We also hold an exclusive license from NovImmune SA, for patents and patent applications that cover our product candidates that utilize our anti-TLR4 and anti-CXCL10 monoclonal antibody technology in the United States, Canada and various other countries. Composition of matter patents, for which we hold an inbound license from NovImmune, have been issued that will expire as late as 2033 and 2028, respectively. We expect to seek patent term extension in the United States related to time under IND, which could extend protection. We have also filed additional method of use patent applications which we believe, if issued, could potentially prevent biosimilar substitution until as late as 2041. We have also filed provisional patent applications for use of these monoclonal antibody technologies in vitiligo (EB06) and systemic sclerosis (EB07).

In the event we are successful in commercializing a new drug candidate, we believe we would be eligible for data/market exclusivity, in addition to exclusivity rights granted through patent protection. We would be eligible for up to five years of exclusivity for EB01 and EB02 and up to twelve years of exclusivity for EB05 and EB06 after approval in the United States, and, for any of these drug products, eight years of exclusivity after approval in Canada and ten years of exclusivity after approval in the European Union.

We expect patents and other proprietary intellectual property rights to be an essential element of our business. We intend to protect our proprietary positions by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and other in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights.

License Agreement with NovImmune SA

In April 2020, our wholly owned subsidiary Edesa Biotech Research, Inc. entered into an exclusive license agreement with NovImmune SA, which operates under the brand Light Chain Bioscience, whereby we obtained exclusive rights throughout the world to certain know-how, patents and data relating to the monoclonal antibodies targeting TLR4 and CXCL10 (the Constructs). Edesa will use the exclusive rights to develop products containing these Constructs (the Licensed Products) for therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic applications in humans and animals. Unless earlier terminated, the term of the license agreement will remain in effect for twenty-five years from the date of first commercial sale of Licensed Products. Subsequently, the license agreement will automatically renew for five-year periods unless either party terminates the agreement in accordance with its terms.

Under the license agreement, we are exclusively responsible, at our expense, for the research, development manufacture, marketing, distribution and commercialization of the Constructs and Licensed Products and to obtain all necessary licenses and rights. Edesa is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the Constructs in accordance with the terms of a development plan established by the parties. In exchange for the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the Constructs, we issued to NovImmune $2.5 million of newly designated Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Shares (all of which were subsequently converted into common shares) pursuant to the terms of a securities purchase agreement entered into between the parties concurrently with the license agreement. In addition, Edesa is committed to payments of various amounts to NovImmune upon meeting certain development, approval and commercialization milestones as outlined in the license agreement up to an aggregate amount of $356 million. We also have a commitment to pay NovImmune a royalty based on net sales of Licensed Products in countries where Edesa directly commercializes Licensed Products and a percentage of sublicensing revenue received by Edesa in the countries where Edesa does not directly commercialize Licensed Products.

The license agreement provides that Light Chain will remain the exclusive owner of existing intellectual property in the Constructs and that Edesa will be the exclusive owner of all intellectual property resulting from the exploitation of the Constructs pursuant to the license. Subject to certain limitations, Edesa is responsible for prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing all intellectual property relating to the Constructs. During the term of the agreement, Edesa also has the option to purchase the licensed patents and know-how at a price to be negotiated by the parties. If Edesa defaults or fails to perform any of the terms, covenants, provisions or its obligations under the license agreement, Light Chain has the option to terminate the license agreement, subject to providing Edesa an opportunity to cure such default. The license agreement is also terminable by Light Chain upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy related events pertaining to Edesa. In connection with the license agreement and pursuant to a purchase agreement entered into by the parties in April 2020, we acquired from NovImmune its inventory of the TLR4 antibody for an aggregate purchase price of $5.0 million.

License and Development Agreement with Pendopharm

In August 2017, our wholly owned subsidiary, Edesa Biotech Research, Inc. entered into an exclusive license and development agreement with Pendopharm, a division of Pharmascience Inc. Pursuant to the license and development agreement, we granted to Pendopharm an exclusive license throughout Canada to certain know-how, patents and data for the sole purpose of obtaining regulatory approval for certain pharmaceutical products to allow Pendopharm to distribute, market and sell the licensed products for human therapeutic use in certain gastrointestinal conditions. If Pendopharm elects not to seek regulatory approval of the applicable product, the applicable product will be removed from the license rights granted to Pendopharm and will revert to us. If Pendopharm elects to seek regulatory approval in Canada for the sale and marketing of the applicable product, Pendopharm will be responsible for obtaining regulatory approval for the applicable licensed product in Canada. In exchange for the exclusive rights to market, import, distribute, and sell the pharmaceutical products, Pendopharm is required to pay us a royalty in respect of aggregate annual net sales for each pharmaceutical product sold in Canada. Unless earlier terminated, the term of the license and development agreement will expire, on a licensed product by licensed product basis, on the later to occur of (i) the date that is 13 years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product in Canada; (ii) the date of expiry of the last valid licensed patent in Canada relating to the licensed product; or (iii) the date of expiry of any period of exclusivity granted to the licensed product by a regulatory authority in Canada. The license and development agreement shall also terminate upon the termination of certain license agreements that Edesa has with third parties. Pendopharm also has the right to terminate the license and development agreement for any reason upon 120 days notice to us.

License Agreements with Yissum and Inventor

In June 2016, our wholly owned subsidiary, Edesa Biotech Research, Inc., entered into an exclusive license agreement with Yissum, which was subsequently amended in April 2017, May 2017 and October 2022. Pursuant to the license agreement as amended, we obtained exclusive rights throughout the world to certain know-how, patents and data relating to
 a pharmaceutical product for the following fields of use: therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic uses in topical dermal applications and anorectal applications. Unless earlier terminated, the term of the license agreement will expire on a country by country basis on the later of (i) the date of expiry of the last valid licensed patent in such country; (ii) the date of expiry of any period of exclusivity granted to a product by a regulatory authority in such country or (iii) the date that is 15 years after the first commercial sale of a product in such country.

Under the license agreement, we are exclusively responsible, at our expense, for the development of the product, including conducting clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for the product, and once regulatory approval has been obtained, for the commercialization of the product. We are required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the product in accordance with the terms of a development plan established by the parties. Subject to certain conditions, we are permitted to engage third parties to perform our activities or obligations under the agreement. In exchange for the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the product for topical dermal applications and anorectal applications, we are committed to payments of various amounts to Yissum upon meeting certain milestones outlined in the license agreement up to an aggregate amount of $18.4 million after deducting $0.2 million that is included in the commitments for the year ending September 30, 2023. In addition, in the event of a divestiture of substantially all of our assets, we are obligated to pay Yissum a percentage of the valuation of the licensed technology sold as determined by an external objective expert. We also have a commitment to pay Yissum a royalty based on net sales of the product in countries where we, or an affiliate of ours, directly commercializes the product and a percentage of sublicensing revenue received by us and our affiliates in the countries where we do not directly commercialize the product.

The license agreement provides that Yissum shall remain the exclusive owner of the licensed technology and that we are responsible for preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining the patents on the licensed technology in Yissum’s name. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will be the exclusive owner of all patents and other intellectual property that is made by or on our behalf after the date of the agreement, including all improvements to the licensed technology. If we default or fail to perform any of the terms, covenants, provisions or our obligations under the license agreement, Yissum has the option to terminate the license agreement, subject to providing us with an opportunity to cure such default. We have the right to terminate the agreement if we determine that the development and commercialization of the product is no longer commercially viable. Subject to certain exceptions, we have undertaken to indemnify Yissum against any liability, including product liability, damage, loss or expense derived from the use, development, manufacture, marketing, sale or sublicensing of the licensed product and technology.

In March 2021, through Edesa Biotech Research, Inc., we entered into a license agreement with the inventor of the same pharmaceutical product to acquire global rights for all fields of use beyond those named under the 2016 license agreement with Yissum. As a result of the license agreement entered into with inventor, Edesa now holds exclusive global rights to the pharmaceutical product that forms the basis of our EB01 and EB02 drug candidates for all fields of use in humans and animals. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the product in accordance with the terms of a development plan established by the parties. Edesa is exclusively responsible, at its expense, for the development of the product. We are committed to remaining payments of up to an aggregate amount of $69.1 million, primarily relating to future potential commercial approval and sales milestones. In addition, if we fail to file an IND or foreign equivalent for the product within a certain period of time following the date of the agreement, we are required to remit to the inventor a fixed license fee annually as long as the requirement to file an IND remains unfulfilled. Edesa also has a commitment to pay the inventor a royalty based on net sales of the product in countries where Edesa, or an affiliate, directly commercializes the product and a percentage of sublicensing revenue received by Edesa and its affiliates in the countries where the company does not directly commercialize the product. Subject to certain exceptions, we have undertaken to indemnify Licensor against any liability, including product liability, damage, loss or expense derived from the use, development, manufacture, marketing, sale or sublicensing of the licensed product and technology.

Manufacturing and Marketing

We rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce both our synthetic chemical and biological product candidates for clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. Additional contract manufacturers are used to fill, label, package and distribute investigational drug products. We believe that this strategy will enable us to direct operational and financial resources to the development of our product candidates rather than diverting resources to establishing manufacturing infrastructure. Our current arrangements with our manufacturers are subject to customary industry terms and conditions, and manufacturing is performed on an as-requested basis. While we have not experienced significant shortages of raw materials to date, as a result of increased industry demand, CMOs have generally reported that supplies of raw materials and critical components necessary for manufacturing processes have been more challenging and expensive to obtain, and longer lead times may be required for scheduling future production runs. We believe that we have sufficient supplies on hand to complete our clinical studies of EB05 and EB01.

To supply future clinical studies and potential commercialization of our product candidates, we are engaged in discussions with various CMOs regarding long-term supply agreements. These supply agreements typically require significant financial commitments, including upfront amounts prior to commencement of manufacturing, progress payments through the course of the manufacturing process as well as payments for technology transfer and other start-up costs. Based on our discussions with CMOs and industry announcements regarding future expansion plans, we believe there will be sufficient supplies of raw materials and manufacturing capacity to service our near-term and future product needs.

Because we are focused on the discovery and development of drugs, we do not have any marketing or distribution capabilities, nor are we at a stage where we would have any customers for our investigational medicines. If we receive marketing approval or emergency use authorization in the United States, Canada or Europe for a product candidate, we plan to either build the capabilities to commercialize the product candidate in the applicable region with our own focused, specialized sales force, or alternatively, outsource the sales and marketing infrastructure necessary to market and sell our products. We also plan to utilize strategic licensing, collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements with third parties for the further development or commercialization of our products and product candidates, where applicable, such as in areas or regions outside North America where a partner may contribute additional resources, infrastructure and expertise. 

Competition

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is highly competitive, and the development and commercialization of new drugs is influenced by rapid technological developments and innovation. We face competition from companies developing and commercializing products that will be competitive with our drug candidates, including large pharmaceutical and smaller biotechnology companies, many of which have greater financial and commercial resources than we do. For our EB01 and EB02 product candidates, our potential competitors include, among others, Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc., Brickell Biotech, Inc., Citius Pharmaceuticals Inc., Dermavant Sciences, Inc. and Leo Pharma A/S. For our EB05 product candidate, there are numerous competing therapies, including prophylactic vaccines for the SARS-Cov2 virus, experimental stem cell therapies, novel therapeutics and repurposed commercial drugs. Our potential competitors include, among others: Aqualung Therapeutics Corporation, Athersys, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Enzychem Lifesciences Corp., Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., Merck & Co, Inc., Mesoblast Limited, Pfizer Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Roche Holding AG and Veru Inc. For any future product for vitiligo or systemic sclerosis, potential competitors, include, among others: Bausch Health, Galderma Laboratories, LP, Incyte Corporation, Boehringer Ingelheim AG, Chemomab Therapeutics Ltd., F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, GlaxoSmithKline plc., Merck & Co., Inc., Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, Sanofi S.A. and Seagen, Inc. Some of the competing product development programs may be based on scientific approaches that are similar to our approach, and others may be based on entirely different approaches. Potential competitors also include new entrants to the market, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of products similar to ours or that otherwise target indications that we are pursuing. Key factors affecting the success of any approved product will be its efficacy, safety profile, drug interactions, method of administration, pricing, reimbursement and level of promotional activity relative to those of competing drugs. We believe that our product candidates will compete favorably with respect to such factors. However, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors.
Government Regulation

We plan to conduct clinical studies and seek approvals for our product candidates in the United States, Canada, European Union and other jurisdictions. Therefore, we currently are, and may in the future be, subject to a variety of national and regional regulations governing clinical trials as well as commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved.

To conduct clinical trials for our product candidates, we rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators. Although we have entered into agreements with these third parties, we continue to be responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with our investigational plan or research protocol, as well as International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, which include guidelines for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials.

The FDA in the United States, Health Canada in Canada, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the European Union and comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products and product candidates. These agencies and other federal, state, provincial and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, packaging, importing, distribution, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record-keeping, approval and promotion of our products and product candidates. All of our product candidates will require regulatory approval before commercialization. In particular, therapeutic product candidates for human use are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other statutory and regulatory requirements of the United States, Canada, the EU and foreign countries. Obtaining these marketing approvals and subsequently complying with ongoing statutory and regulatory requirements require substantial time, effort and financial resources.

United States Regulations

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act as well as the Public Health Service (PHS) Act for biological drugs. The process required by the FDA before our product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

· | Pre-clinical testing. Drug developers complete extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations and other applicable requirements. These studies typically assess efficacy, toxicology and pharmacokinetics. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (IND), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. As part of an IND application to the FDA, trial sponsors submit the results of pre- clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data. The IND automatically becomes effective 30-days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time frame, has questions or concerns about the proposed study. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding items before the clinical trial can begin. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive phase of a clinical trial conducted during product development.
· | Approval by a central or institutional review board (IRB), or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completion. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
· | Multiple Phases of Human Clinical Trials. Drug developers conduct adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials that establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the intended use, typically in the following three stages, which are often sequential but may overlap: 


- | Phase 1: The clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy human volunteers or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients. Phase 1 clinical trials can be designed to evaluate the impact of the product candidate in combination with currently approved drugs. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Phase 2: These clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information before beginning a larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trial. 
- | Phase 3: These clinical trials are commonly referred to as pivotal clinical trials. If the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are then undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.


· | Manufacturing Facilities. Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA). The results of the nonclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an application to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the United States. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the application does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators do. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw a drug approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the drug reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require further testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials (postmarketing), and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved drugs which have been commercialized. The FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, if there are any modifications to a drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA or a supplement, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers.


14


Satisfaction of FDA regulations and requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically take several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. Typically, if a product candidate is intended to treat a chronic disease, as is the case with some of our product candidates, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period.

Expedited Development and Review Programs

The FDA has several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval.

A new drug is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed. Rolling review means that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application.

In addition, a new drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life- threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.

Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review, once an NDA or BLA is submitted, if the drug that is the subject of the marketing application has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal date to take action on the marketing application is six months compared to ten months for a standard review. Products are eligible for Accelerated Approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality.

Accelerated Approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or an indication approved under Accelerated Approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, the FDA generally requires, as a condition for Accelerated Approval, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period. After the 120-day period has passed, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.


15


Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval, though they may expedite the development or review process.

Emergency Use Authorizations

While, in most cases, a therapeutic must be approved by FDA before the product may be sold, when there is a public health emergency involving chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agents, including infectious diseases like Covid-19, new therapeutics may be distributed pursuant to an Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA. Under an EUA, FDA may authorize the emergency use of an unapproved medical product or an unapproved use of an approved product for certain emergency circumstances to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have been met, and after the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services has issued a declaration of emergency or threat justifying emergency use.

To receive an EUA, the product sponsor must demonstrate that the product “may be effective” in the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of an applicable disease or condition. Additionally, FDA must determine that the product’s known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks. Further there must be no adequate, approved, and available alternative product for the indication. Potential alternative products may be unavailable if there are insufficient supplies to meet the emergency need. FDA may establish additional conditions on an EUA that are necessary to protect public health, including conditions related to information that must be disseminated to health care providers and patients, the monitoring and reporting of adverse events, and record keeping. Conditions may also relate to how a product is distributed and administered and how a product is advertised. Importantly, EUAs are not full marketing approvals. Rather, EUAs are only effective for the duration of the applicable EUA declaration. Full approval of the product under applicable standards would be necessary to continue to distribute the product absent an EUA. EUAs may also be revised or revoked by FDA at any time.

Other Regulatory Requirements

Any products manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators (pursuant to FDA approval) are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties.

The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.

The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been broadly interpreted to apply to manufacturer arrangements with prescribers, purchasers and pharmacy benefit managers, among others. Several other countries, including the United Kingdom, have enacted similar anti-kickback laws and regulations.

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or for knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.


16


The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, referred to together as the Affordable Care Act, require manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value made to or at the request of covered recipients, such as physicians and teaching hospitals, and physician ownership and investment interests in such manufacturers. Among other payments, the law requires payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals for clinical trials be disclosed.

Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to future potential sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, or the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures to the extent that those laws impose requirements that are more stringent than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Canada Regulations

Health Canada is the Canadian federal authority that regulates, evaluates and monitors the safety, effectiveness, and quality of drugs, medical devices, and other therapeutic products available to Canadians. Health Canada’s regulatory process for review, approval and regulatory oversight of products is similar to the regulatory process conducted by the FDA. To initiate clinical testing of a drug candidate in human subjects in Canada, a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) must be filed with and approved by Health Canada. In addition, all federally regulated trials must be approved and monitored by research ethics boards. The review boards study and approve study-related documents and monitor trial data.

Prior to being given market authorization for a drug product, a manufacturer must present substantive scientific evidence of a product’s safety, efficacy and quality as required by the Food and Drugs Act (Canada) and its associated regulations, including the Food and Drug Regulations. This information is usually submitted in the form of a New Drug Submission (NDS). Health Canada reviews the submitted information, sometimes using external consultants and advisory committees, to evaluate the potential benefits and risks of a drug. If after the review, the conclusion is that the patient benefits outweigh the risks associated with the drug, the drug is issued a Drug Identification Number (DIN), followed by a Notice of Compliance (NOC), which permits the market authorization holder (i.e., the NOC and DIN holder) to market the drug in Canada. Drugs granted an NOC may be subject to additional postmarket surveillance and reporting requirements.

All establishments engaged in the fabrication, packaging/labeling, importation, distribution, and wholesale of drugs and operation of a testing laboratory relating to drugs are required to hold a Drug Establishment License to conduct one or more of the licensed activities unless expressly exempted under the Food and Drug Regulations. The basis for the issuance of a Drug Establishment License is to ensure the facility complies with cGMP as stipulated in the Food and Drug Regulations and as determined by cGMP inspection conducted by Health Canada. An importer of pharmaceutical products manufactured at foreign sites must also be able to demonstrate that the foreign sites comply with cGMP, and such foreign sites are included on the importer’s Drug Establishment License.

Regulatory obligations and oversight continue following the initial market approval of a pharmaceutical product. For example, every market authorization holder must report any new information received concerning adverse drug reactions, including timely reporting of serious adverse drug reactions that occur in Canada and any serious unexpected adverse drug reactions that occur outside of Canada. The market authorization holder must also notify Health Canada of any new safety and efficacy issues that it becomes aware of after the launch of a product.

Smaller Reporting Company

We are currently a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and are thus allowed to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in our filings, are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act requiring that an independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and have certain other reduced disclosure obligations with respect to our SEC filings.
