General Overview
 
Tauriga Sciences, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Florida corporation, with its principal place of business being located at 555 Madison Avenue, Fifth Floor, New York, NY 10022. Prior to December 12, 2011, the Company was involved in the business of exploiting new technologies for the production of clean energy. The Company has, over time, moved into that of a diversified life sciences technology company, with its mission to operate a revenue generating business, while continuing to evaluate potential acquisition candidates operating in the life sciences technology space.
TAURI-GUMTM
 
In October 2018, the Company’s management, along with its board of directors, began to explore the possibility of launching a cannabidiol (“CBD”) infused gum product line into the commercial marketplace. After several weeks of diligence, discussions with various parties and exploratory meetings, the Company made the determination to move forward with this business opportunity.

Subsequent to our fiscal year end of March 31, 2019, the Company entered into several agreements with distributors to arrange for the distribution of this product line, as described below.
 
E&M Distribution Agreement
 
On April 1, 2019, the Company entered into a comprehensive distribution agreement with E&M Ice Cream Company (“E&M”) to establish Tauri-GumTM in the New York City metropolitan area marketplace (the “E&M Distribution Agreement”). Under terms of this Agreement, E&M will distribute Tauri-GumTM to hundreds of NYC based retail store locations by the summer of 2019, with the goal of exceeding 1,000 locations by the end of fiscal 2019. As of May 31, 2019, the Company’s product is in at least 287 locations. The Company has supported the NYC Tauri-GumTM commercial launch with substantial levels of both financial resources and marketing support. The Company has made the strategic decision to initially largely focus its commercialization efforts on the New York City retail marketplace due to excellent NYC distribution relationships and the Company’s belief that it can launch its Tauri-GumTM brand in NYC in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Also, the Company has both received payment for and delivered the product for its previously announced $54,000 Tauri-GumTM purchase order during March 2019. The Company has agreed to issue a one-time issuance of 1,000,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock, and to tender a one-time cash payment of $125,000 to E&M. This $125,000 cash component was paid in full to E&M on April 1, 2019, and the value of the shares will be reflected in stock-based compensation based on the grant date of April 1, 2019. The Company is awaiting issuance instructions from E&M to issue the shares.
South Florida Region Distribution Agreement
 
On April 8, 2019, the Company entered into a non-exclusive distribution agreement with IRM Management Corporation (“IRM”), an established medical practice management firm (the “IRM Distribution Agreement”). The purpose of the IRM Distribution Agreement is to target our Tauri-GumTM product to the South Florida based medical market, including chiropractors, orthopedists, as well as prospective retail customers in this geographic area.
 
Under terms of this IRM Distribution Agreement, the Company will work closely with IRM to promote Tauri-GumTM. In connection with this IRM Distribution Agreement, the Company has also agreed to a one-time issuance of 450,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock and a cash stipend of $10,000 to IRM. As of the date of this report, only $2,000 of the $10,000 cash stipend has been paid. The value of the restricted shares will be reflected in stock-based compensation based on the grant date of April 8, 2019.
 
North Eastern United States Distribution Agreement
 
On April 30, 2019, the Company, entered into a non-exclusive comprehensive distribution agreement with Sai Krishna LLC (“SKL”), a New Jersey based distributor, with relationships in the Northeast region of the United States and Asia, with the intention of increasing and accelerating market penetration of the Company’s Tauri-GumTM product line in the applicable regions.
 
In connection with the SKL Agreement, the Company agreed to a one-time issuance of an aggregate of 1,000,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock, which are subject to the customary resale and transfer restrictions imposed under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The foregoing equity issuance to SKL and the other named persons affiliated with SKL was issued in accordance with the following schedule: (i) to Mr. Mahesh Lekkala, 500,000 restricted shares the Company’s common stock within ten (10) business days of April 30, 2019; and (ii) to SKL, 500,000, which were permitted to be immediately allocated by SKL to persons within its organization and, as such, (a) 250,000 of such shares shall be issued to Sai Krishna within ten (10) business days of April 30, 2019, and the additional issuance of (b) 250,000 of such shares shall be issued to Sai Krishna within ten (10) business days of August 1, 2019. Other than the payment terms for Tauri-GumTM product purchased and distributed under the terms of the Agreement, there is no additional cash payment due or owing by the Company thereunder. The value of the shares will be reflected as stock-based compensation with a grant date of April 30, 2019. All but 250,000 shares were expensed the date of issuance, with those 250,000 shares valued over the term of the one-year agreement.
 
On May 11, 2019, the Company entered into a consulting agreement pursuant to the terms of the SKL distribution agreement, whereby Ms. Neelima Lekkala was appointed Vice President of Distribution & Marketing. This agreement has a one-year term and may be extended based upon mutual agreement of Ms. Lekkala and the Company. Ms. Lekkala will focus her efforts on the expansion of Tauri-GumTM in terms of gross sales and revenue growth through the acquisition of new customers, establishment of professional marketing materials & protocols, logistics improvement(s) and fulfillment services. Ms. Lekkala is not an executive officer of the Company and, therefore, is not deemed to be an affiliate of the Company. Ms. Lekkala’s compensation includes 250,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock, which are fully earned and vested upon the execution of her consulting agreement. These shares were issued May 20, 2019, having a value of $18,275 based on the closing price of the Company’s stock on that day. Additionally, Ms. Lekkala will receive a 30% commission on total gross sales through the sale of the Tauri-GumTM product line, which the Company may pay in either stock or cash at the election of Ms. Lekkala.

Food and Drug Administration
 
On May 31, 2019, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) held public hearings to obtain scientific data and information about the safety, manufacturing, product quality, marketing, labeling, and sale of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds, including CBD. The hearing comes approximately five months after the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (more commonly known as the Farm Bill), went into effect and removed industrial hemp from the Schedule I prohibition under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (industrial hemp means cannabis plants and derivatives that contain no more than 0.3 percent tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, on a dry weight basis).
 
Though the Farm Bill removed industrial hemp from the Schedule I list, the Farm Bill preserved the regulatory authority of the FDA over cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds used in food and pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. The FDA has been clear that it intends to use this authority to regulate cannabis and cannabis-derived products, including CBD, in the same manner as any other food or drug ingredient. In addition to holding the hearing, the agency has requested comments by July 2, 2019 regarding any health and safety risks of CBD use, and how products containing CBD are currently produced and marketed. See our Risk Factors for more information about these items.
 
2018 Reverse Stock Split
 
On March 12, 2018, the Company held a meeting of its board of directors. The matters voted on and approved at the meeting included an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to decrease the number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.00001 par value per share from 7,500,000,000 to 100,000,000 shares and to affect a reverse stock split of the Company’s Common Stock at a ratio of 1-for-75 (the “Reverse Stock Split”).
 
On June 8, 2018, the Company filed an Articles of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida, for the aforementioned decrease in the number of authorized shares and to affect a 1-for-75 reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock. The Reverse Stock Split became effective at 12:01 a.m. on July 9, 2018.
 
The Reverse Stock Split affected all issued and outstanding shares of common stock, as well as common stock underlying stock options, warrants and other convertible securities outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of outstanding shares of the common stock outstanding prior to the Reverse Stock Split from 4,078,179,672 shares to 54,380,230 shares immediately following the Reverse Stock Split. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, and any such stockholders whose number of post-split shares would have resulted in a fractional number had his/her/its shares rounded up to the next number of shares. On July 30, 2018, the Company’s stock began trading on the OTC:QB.
 
All references set forth in this annual report to number of shares or per share data have been presented on a post reverse stock-split basis.
 
Cupuaçu Butter Lip Balm
 
On December 23, 2016, the Company entered into a non-exclusive 12-month license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Cleveland, Ohio based cosmetics products company Ice + Jam LLC (“Ice + Jam”) to market Ice + Jam’s proprietary cupuaçu butter lip balm, sold under the trademark HerMan®. The two companies were to evenly share on a 50/50 basis any profits generated through the Company’s marketing, sales and distribution efforts. The Company had agreed to pay the production, marketing and start-up costs for all product it sells to retail customers or distributors. As part of the License Agreement, the Company issued 66,667 restricted shares of our common stock to Ice + Jam, which had a value of $27,500, based on the closing price of the stock on the day the Company entered into the agreement ($0.4125 per share). The cost of the shares were prorated over the term of the initial license.
 
During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company launched a lip balm product (branded as HERMAN®). On November 27, 2017, the Company announced a 2-year extension to the existing non-exclusive License Agreement, extending it through December 23, 2019. The two companies reserved the right to request amendment of the License Agreement at any point during the effective term of the agreement. In February of 2018, the Company’s strategy with respect to the HerMan® product was negatively impacted by a series of product defects relating to the twisting mechanism of the lip balm tube. The Company was hopeful that this product would provide the Company with sustainable revenue at margins that would justify the initial expense and effort; however, as a result of the manufacturing issue and other factors, the Company made the determination to not invest additional capital resources into this product segment and discontinued this business unit’s operations as of March 31, 2019.
 
The Company had no sales of the HerMan® product during the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to $1,188 of sale during the year ended March 31, 2018, as reflected in discontinued operations. The Company has removed the product from the website. The remaining inventory of $16,897 was written off as of the previous year ended March 31, 2018 as it determined that the units were not usable.
 
Honeywood
 
On March 10, 2014, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire California-based Honeywood LLC (“Honeywood”), developer of a topical medicinal cannabis product, that, at the time, sold in numerous dispensaries across the state of California. This definitive agreement was valid for a period of 120 days and the Company advanced to Honeywood $217,000 to be applied towards the final closing requisite cash total and incurred $178,000 in legal fees as of March 31, 2014 in connection with the acquisition.

On September 24, 2014 (the “Unwinding Date”), the Company, Honeywood and each of Honeywood’s principals entered into a termination agreement to unwind the effects of the merger. In accordance with the termination agreement, Honeywood agreed to repay to the Company substantially all of the advances made by the Company to Honeywood prior to and after the merger by delivering to the Company, on the Unwinding Date, a secured promissory note in the principal amount of $170,000. The note bore interest at 6% per annum and was repayable in six quarterly installments on the last day of each calendar quarter starting on March 31, 2015 and ending on June 30, 2016. The note was secured by a blanket security interest in Honeywood’s assets pursuant to a security agreement entered into on the Unwinding Date between Honeywood and the Company. Honeywood never made any payments under the Note prior to the Honeywood Conversion Agreement (as defined below). As a result, the Company had fully reserved this amount and it was not reflected as a receivable on its financial statements.
 
Effective August 1, 2017, the Company entered into a Debt Conversion Agreement, whereby the Company agreed to convert the entire principal and accrued but unpaid interest due into a 5% membership interest in Honeywood (the “Honeywood Conversion Agreement”).
 
The Company made an assessment for impairment of its investment in Honeywood at the entity level. During the relationship between the Company and Honeywood, Honeywood had a working capital deficiency and had a history of operating losses. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320-10-35-28, “Investments—Debt and Equity Securities”, a Company may not record an impairment loss on the investment but shall continue to evaluate whether the investment is impaired (that is, shall estimate the fair value of the investment) in each subsequent reporting period until either of the following occurs: a) the investment experiences a recovery of fair value up to (or beyond) its cost; or b) the entity recognizes an other-than-temporary impairment loss. At the time of the Honeywood Conversion Agreement, the receivable balance under the note of $199,119 had been fully written off by the Company in a prior period. As a result of the Honeywood Conversion Agreement, the Company deemed the investment to still have no current value. The Company recorded this investment at $0. Thus, no recovery of bad debt and no impairment will be recognized in this period.
 
Pilus Energy
 
On November 25, 2013, the Company executed a definitive merger agreement to acquire Pilus Energy, LLC (“Pilus”), an Ohio limited liability company and a developer of alternative cleantech energy platforms using proprietary microbial solutions that create electricity while consuming polluting molecules from wastewater. On January 28, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of Pilus. As a condition of the acquisition, the shareholders of Pilus received a warrant to purchase 1,333,334 shares of common stock of the Company, which represented a fair market value of approximately $2,000,000, and, based upon whether the Warrants issued to Pilus represented at least 5% the then outstanding and fully diluted capitalization of the Company. In addition, the Company paid Open Therapeutics, LLC (f/k/a Bacterial Robotics, LLC and Microbial Robots, LLC) (“Open Therapeutics”), formerly the parent company of Pilus, $50,000 on signing the merger agreement and $50,000 at the time of closing. Pilus’ principal asset on its balance sheet at the time of the acquisition was its US patent relating to its clean water technology. The Company determined that the value of the acquisition on January 28, 2014 would be equal to the value of cash paid to Pilus plus the value of the 1,333,334 warrants the Company issued to acquire Pilus. Through March 31, 2014, the Company amortized the patent over its estimated useful life, then on March 31, 2014, the Company conducted its annual impairment test and determined that the entire unamortized balance should be impaired as the necessary funding to further develop the patent was not available at that time.
 
On December 22, 2016, the Company entered in a membership interest transfer agreement with Open Therapeutics whereby the Company sold 80% of its membership interest in Pilus back to Open Therapeutics. Open Therapeutics agreed to terminate and cancel 80% of the unexercised portion of the warrant to purchase 385,569 shares (or 308,455 warrants) of the Company’s common stock. Open Therapeutics agreed to pay to the Company 20% of the net profit generated Pilus Energy from its previous year’s earnings, if any. The first $75,000 of such payments was to be retained by Pilus Energy as additional consideration for the sale, which was reflected as a contingent liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company further agreed it would vote its 20% membership interest in Pilus Energy in the same manner that Open Therapeutics votes its membership interest on all matters for which a member vote is required. Through March 31, 2019, there has been no activity recorded by Open Therapeutics with respect to Pilus Energy.
 
On January 12, 2019, the Company and Open Therapeutics agreed to extinguish the above described $75,000 contingent liability in exchange for a one-time issuance of 500,000 restricted shares of Company’s common stock. The shares were recorded at a value of $24,750 ($0.0495 per share) as a loss on settlement in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
Tauriga Biz Dev Corp
 
On January 4, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors unanimously approved the formation a wholly-owned subsidiary focused on acquiring interest(s) in patents and other intellectual property. This subsidiary, incorporated in Delaware, was named Tauriga IP Acquisition Corp. On March 25, 2018, the Company changed the name to Tauriga Biz Dev Corp.

On March 29, 2018 the Company, through Tauriga Biz Dev Corp. (“Tauriga BDC”), entered into an independent sales representative agreement with Blink Charging Co. (Nasdaq: BLNK) to be a non-exclusive independent sales representative. Under the terms of the agreement with Blink, the Company is permitted to solicit orders from potential customers for electric vehicle (“EV”) charging station placement. This sales agreement is a three-tier model based on whether Tauriga BDC contracts the new customer to purchase equipment outright from Blink or enter into one of two revenue-sharing agreements. In the case Tauriga BDC effectuates a sale of Blink equipment, it will receive a one-time sales commission based on the sales price of the equipment sale. In the case where Tauriga BDC secures a revenue sharing agreement with a customer where Blink remains the owner, Tauriga BDC will be paid an on-going commission based off of gross charger revenue, subject to which party paid for the installation. Commission payments under the revenue sharing agreement are subject to minimum revenue generation hurdles.
 
On June 29, 2018, the Company purchased four Blink Level 2 - 40” pedestal chargers for permanent placement in a retail location or locations whereby the Company will pay a variable annual fee based on 7% of total revenue per charging unit. The rest of the proceeds will be split 80/20 between the Company and the host location owner or its assignee. The host location owner to will pay for the cost of providing power to these unit as well as installation costs.
 
As of March 31, 2019, Tauriga BDC has not installed any of these machines in any locations, and no revenue has been generated through the Blink contract.

On May 24, 2019, the Company entered into a one year 8% $60,000 Convertible Note with GS Capital Partners, LLC pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement. The GS Capital Note has a maturity date of May 23, 2020 and carried a $5,000 original issue discount (such that $55,000 was funded to the Company on May 24, 2019). The holder is entitled, at its option, at any time after cash payment, to convert all or any amount of the principal face amount of the GS Note then outstanding into shares of the Company’s common stock at a price for each share of common stock equal to 66% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the common stock as reported on the National Quotations Bureau OTC Markets exchange, which the Company’s shares are traded or any exchange upon which the common stock may be traded in the future, for the fifteen (15) prior trading days including the day upon which a notice of conversion is received by the Company or its transfer agent. Such conversion shall be effectuated by the Company delivering the shares of common stock to the holder within 3 business days of receipt by the Company of the notice of conversion. Accrued but unpaid interest shall be subject to conversion. To the extent the conversion price of the Company’s common stock closes below the par value per share, the Company will take all steps necessary to solicit the consent of the stockholders to reduce the par value to the lowest value possible under law. The Company agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this increase. In the event the Company experiences a DTC “Chill” on its shares, the conversion price shall be decreased to 56% instead of 66% while that “Chill” is in effect. In no event shall the holder be allowed to affect a conversion if such conversion, along with all other shares of the Company common stock beneficially owned by the holder and its affiliates would exceed 9.9% of the outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company. During the first six months that the GS Capital Note is in effect, the Company may redeem the GS Note by paying to the holder an amount as follows: (i) if the redemption is within the first 90 days of the issuance date, then for an amount equal to 120% of the unpaid principal amount of this Note along with any interest that has accrued during that period, (ii) if the redemption is after the 91st day, but less than the 180th day of the issuance date, then for an amount equal to 133% of the unpaid principal amount of this Note along with any accrued interest.

On June 7, 2019, GS Capital Partners, LLC converted $40,000 of principal and $1,973 of accrued interest into 888,308 shares of common stock pursuant to the October 25, 2018 one-year $180,000 convertible note.
 
On June 21, 2019, the Company entered into a one year 8% $60,000 Convertible Note with GS Capital Partners, LLC pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement. The GS Capital Note has a maturity date of June 21, 2020 and carried a $5,000 original issue discount (such that $55,000 was funded to the Company on June 21, 2019). The holder is entitled, at its option, at any time after cash payment, to convert all or any amount of the principal face amount of the GS Note then outstanding into shares of the Company’s common stock at a price for each share of common stock equal to 66% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the common stock as reported on the National Quotations Bureau OTC Markets exchange, which the Company’s shares are traded or any exchange upon which the common stock may be traded in the future, for the fifteen (15) prior trading days including the day upon which a notice of conversion is received by the Company or its transfer agent. Such conversion shall be effectuated by the Company delivering the shares of common stock to the holder within 3 business days of receipt by the Company of the notice of conversion. Accrued but unpaid interest shall be subject to conversion. To the extent the conversion price of the Company’s common stock closes below the par value per share, the Company will take all steps necessary to solicit the consent of the stockholders to reduce the par value to the lowest value possible under law. The Company agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this increase. In the event the Company experiences a DTC “Chill” on its shares, the conversion price shall be decreased to 56% instead of 66% while that “Chill” is in effect. In no event shall the holder be allowed to affect a conversion if such conversion, along with all other shares of the Company common stock beneficially owned by the holder and its affiliates would exceed 9.9% of the outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company. During the first six months that the GS Capital Note is in effect, the Company may redeem the GS Note by paying to the holder an amount as follows: (i) if the redemption is within the first 90 days of the issuance date, then for an amount equal to 120% of the unpaid principal amount of this Note along with any interest that has accrued during that period, (ii) if the redemption is after the 91st day, but less than the 180th day of the issuance date, then for an amount equal to 133% of the unpaid principal amount of this Note along with any accrued interest. The GS Note may not be redeemed after 180 days. The Company may not redeem the GS Capital Note after the 180th day from entering into it. Upon an event of default, among other default provisions set forth in the GS Capital Note, (i) interest shall accrue at a default interest rate of 24% per annum or, if such rate is usurious or not permitted by current law, then at the highest rate of interest permitted by law. (ii) if the Company shall fail to deliver to the holder the shares of common stock without restrictive legend (when permissible in accordance with applicable law) within three (3) business days of its receipt of a notice of conversion, then the Company shall pay a penalty of $250 per day the shares are not issued beginning on the 4th day after the conversion notice was delivered to the Company (which shall be increased to $500 per day beginning on the 10th day); (iii) if the Company’s stock ceases to be listed on an exchange, its stock is suspended from trading for more than 10 consecutive trading days or the Company ceases to file its reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, then the outstanding principal due under the GS Capital Note shall increase by 50%; or (iv) if the GS Capital Note is not paid at maturity, the outstanding principal due under this Note shall increase by 10%.
 
In connection with the GS Capital Note, the Company issued irrevocable transfer agent instructions reserving 2,650,000 shares of its Common Stock for conversions under this Note equal to two and a half times the discounted value of the Note (the “Share Reserve”) within 5 days from the date of execution, and shall maintain a 2.5 times reserve for the amount then outstanding.

ASP September 2015 Note
 
On May 29, 2019, the Company and Alternative Strategy Partners PTE Ltd. (“ASP”) consummated the retirement of that certain $180,000 face value non-convertible bridge loan agreement (“ASP Loan Agreement”), which had been entered into by the Company and ASP on September 23, 2015. As disclosed on the Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q (filed January 21, 2019), the ASP Loan Agreement matured in December 2015 and carried a liability (principal and accrued interest) on the Company’s books of $113,468. By way of background, under the terms of the ASP Loan Agreement, $90,000 (of the 180,000 principal loan) was to be wired by ASP directly to Eishin Co., Ltd. (“Eishin”), a Japanese based consumer product firm, in exchange for an equity stake in Eishin by the Company; however, the remaining $90,000 was never documented or evidenced as being sent, and the Company never received any shares of common or other class of stock in Eishin, which formed the basis of the Company’s disputed balance with ASP.

In settlement of the aggregate sums claimed to be owed by ASP under the ASP Loan Agreement, the Company agreed to transfer and assign to ASP all right, title and interest it has or may have in securities of Eishin, and to do all things necessary to effect such transfer and assignment under Japanese law upon ASP’s written request, which shall be at ASP’s sole reasonable expense. As a result, the Company and ASP agreed and acknowledged that they shall have no debt, liability or any obligation between them and that the ASP Loan Agreement is immediately retired (except with respect to the assignment and transfer of the Eishin shares noted above). The $113,468 liability has been removed from the Company’s balance sheet, as will be reflected in the Company’s next quarterly report to be filed on Form 10-Q.
 
Investments
 
On April 8, 2019, the Company invested $20,400, in Küdzoo, Inc., a private Company, in which the Company had previously invested $37,500. The $20,400 investment was recorded at cost representing a 0.2% of the proportionate interest in the outstanding of the Company after this offering based on a pre-money valuation of $10,200,000.
Operating Lease
 
Effective April 1, 2019, the Company has adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and will account for its current lease in terms of the right of use assets and offsetting lease liability obligations for this new lease under this pronouncement. In accordance with ASC 842 - Leases, effective April 1, 2019, the Company will record additional net lease right of use asset and a lease liability at present value of approximately $18,730 and $18,978, respectively. The Company is recording these at present value, in accordance with the standard, using a discount rate of 8% which is representative of the last borrowing rates for notes issued to a non-related party. The right of use asset is composed of the sum of all lease payments, at present value, and is amortized straight line over the life of the expected lease term. For the expected term of the lease the Company will use the initial term of the two-year lease. If the Company does elect to exercise its option to extend the lease for additional years, that election will be treated as a lease modification and the lease will be reviewed for remeasurement. This lease will be treated as an operating lease under the new standard.
 
The Company has chosen to implement this standard using the modified retrospective model approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment, which does not require the Company to adjust the comparative periods presented when transitioning to the new guidance on April 1, 2019. The Company has also elected to utilize the transition related practical expedients permitted by the new standard. The modified retrospective approach provides a method for recording existing leases at adoption and in comparative periods that approximates the results of a modified retrospective approach. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of additional net lease assets and lease liabilities of approximately $18,730 and $1,978 as of April 1, 2019. Any difference between the additional lease assets and lease liabilities, net of the deferred tax impact, will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. The standard is not expected to materially impact our consolidated net earnings and had no impact on cash flows.
