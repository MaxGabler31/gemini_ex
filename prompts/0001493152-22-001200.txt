The Company, serving as a holding company, conducts its business through its two operating subsidiaries: (i) NuAxess 2, Inc.; (ii) PR345, Inc., n/k/a OpenAxess, Inc.;
 
NuAxess is engaged in providing a full spectrum of consulting and staffing business services related to employee benefits, insurance, and financial services, principally to smaller and mid-sized employers. The Company and its subsidiaries are offering innovative alternatives to legacy companies that have dominated the benefit, financial and insurance landscape for decades. Through various means and using technology that promotes providing employees and their dependents with multiple levels of benefits including major medical health insurance, as well as providing financial and business consulting services. The Company has entered into third-party agreements with select strategic partners to provide comprehensive programs administered through its contracted vendor relationships. The Company offers its programs via platforms that include technology innovations and sponsoring affordable major medical health insurance plans and other employee benefit products and services. The NuAxess Smart Healthcare Plan (NSP) is a proprietary self-insured health plan that is an ERISA-qualified plan, and includes wellness and prevention programs and employee health saving accounts, among other features. The NSP promotes complete transparency of provider costs and claims data with shared savings programs, as well. The Company’s primary markets are small and mid-size group employers, sometimes referred to as the ‘gig’ economy.
 
Through its employer of record (EOR) staffing companies and its use of contracted professional employer organization (PEO) services and its proprietary health saving account administration, the Company can provide employers and their employees with invaluable aggregated HIPAA aggregated compliant data that can be used to analyze and evaluate healthcare services used to support the Company’s medical reinsurance stop-loss risk taking business via captive reinsurance companies. The Company’s services are designed to support a transparent, single administrative program that is comprehensive and easy to manage by employers, and employees encompassing comprehensive human resources (HR) and even payroll services that includes workers’ compensation insurance, risk and compliance controls, medical stop loss reinsurance, health savings account administration, financial services, real-time employee healthcare support, Cafeteria 125 IRC Section 105 and 106 programs, and employee and employer retirement benefit programs mostly through the use of employee owned health saving accounts (HSA). The NuAxess Smart Healthcare plan embraces the national effort to provide mental health parity in major medical comprehensive health insurance coverages and, for example, through the use of its tele-mental behavioral health programs, we believe that many new and innovative methods are now available and will be developed to better treat opioid addiction, PTSD, suicide prevention, and increase adherence to mental health treatment protocols as well as lessen the percentage of patient appointment no-shows all producing better outcomes for patients. Many experts say this has become a critical area since the government mandated COVID-19 shut-downs and pandemic related job losses has occurred.
 
OpenAxess f/k/a PR 345, Inc. is a staffing business that developed its competitive partially self-insured major medical plans to offer employees for their comprehensive medical insurance benefits replacing fully insured medical plans.

OpenAxess has been providing benefits to employees for several years and has been developing proprietary technology to support its members. Through OpenAxess successful self-funded plan program that are ERISA based, the Company was able to further develop its other subsidiary NuAxess 2, Inc.’s proprietary NuAxess Smart Healthcare Plan (NSP) and it resulted in NuAxess joint venturing with a national PEO company called Infiniti HR, Inc. in 2019. The joint venture companies are called PrimeAxess, Inc., and PrimeAxess 2, Inc. and they will primarily promote the use of NuAxess Smart Healthcare Plan and HSA for Infiniti HR clients both old and new. NuAxess Smart Healthcare Plans can be also be used for larger employee groups that wish to be the plan administrator under a single employer trust. PrimeAxess can be also be used as a staffing company should the joint venture decide to promote it as such.

Termination of iCan Acquisition
 
On January 8, 2021, the Company received and accepted a notice of termination, by mutual agreement, of its acquisition of the iCan Benefit Group, LLC and iCan Holdings, LLC (collectively referred to as “iCan). The mutually agreed termination was the result of: (i) extensive due diligence efforts, including the Company auditing the financial statements of iCan Holdings, LLC and iCan Benefits Group, LLC and subsidiaries; (ii) the refusal by iCan creditors to accept in satisfaction of iCan’s debt the Company’s issuance of 1 million shares of newly authorized 7% Redeemable Preferred Stock having a stated value of $12.50 per share to iCan’s creditors; and (iii) the action by iCan’s creditors on December 31, 2020 under its agreement with iCan not to extend deadlines imposed on iCan to repay iCan’s debt which was originally due on September 29, 2020.
Our Business Strategy
 
The Company, through its subsidiaries and joint venture partners, believes that existing market conditions and the lack of sufficient affordable major medical comprehensive health insurance products and services for small and mid-sized employers and the growing number of participants in the gig-economy should enable the Company to successfully market its health insurance related products and services and a variety of third-party products and services to employers, employees and disparate classes of workers who are classified as small group and today many describe as the growing ‘gig’ economy essential workers. The primary emphasis of the Company is to provide support, using state of the art technology, to employers and employees to facilitate access and achieve a sustainable way to provide their employees quality comprehensive major medical health insurance programs and services that comply with local, state, and federal regulations. Using Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), a U.S. federal statute that protects the retirement assets of Americans by establishing rules to prevent fiduciaries from misuse of plan assets, and through partially self-funded/level funded health insurance plans, small employers, that historically have not used or been able to use traditional health insurance plans from the status quo legacy carriers can actually benefit from self-insurance, as large group employers have benefitted for decades.
 
It is widely recognized that 80% or more of small group employers, because of an historic lack of alternatives, still must use traditional fully-insured health insurance plans issued by the legacy carriers despite the higher premium costs that have nearly doubled since 2010, during which time plan benefits were reduced and deductibles, copays, coinsurance rose. Conversely, more than 90% of large group employers use ERISA qualified health plans and not fully insured legacy carrier health plans. Despite the small group employer market needs and the size of this market in annual premiums paid, which is estimated at $377 billion annually and comprises approximately 60 million workers and growing. The small group employer market is not adequately equipped either financially or through its management’s lack of experience, to properly use and exploit existing ERISA health plans notwithstanding their acknowledged needs, in part because of the complexities in compliance with applicable rules, regulations and laws. We also believe that to implement many of these self-insured ERISA programs, our target market lacks staffing and experience in utilizing new technology platforms that typically require highly trained personnel to effectively implement and operate the actual tasks involved to administer these self-insured health plans.
 
As a result, the Company has developed and, since the beginning of the second fiscal quarter of 2020 has been operating its business plan providing its growing target market with a full range of affordable major medical healthcare plans, technology, financial, and insurance related services. While there can be no assurance of our continued ability to successfully enroll in a timely fashion a sufficient percentage of our target market and begin to generate profitable sustainable operations by providing full-service insurance and benefit solutions with the quality necessary to maintain health benefits and insurance for its employees while minimizing financial risk associated with catastrophic medical claims, except through the use of medical stop loss reinsurance policies offered by A.M. Best rated carriers. It is generally recognized that small group employers do not have the financial capabilities to fund catastrophic liability risks so their use of medical stop-loss reinsurance is mandatory.
 
The medical stop-loss reinsurance business is a complex global industry and, at its most basic level, is simply liability catastrophic insurance rather than medical insurance. The Company through its third-party strategic joint venture partners, e.g., Third Party Administrators ( TPA), Plan Benefit Administrators ( PBA), technology developers, provider services, financial institutions, Infiniti HR, Inc .a national professional employer organization (PEO) and others, have developed a comprehensive benefits and self-insurance system and possesses the experience and skills necessary to medically underwrite employee lives, pay medical claims, and place medical stop-loss reinsurance coverages for its ERISA compliant health plans developed specifically for the small group employer market and gig economy. The medical health insurance plans covering these workers are classified as comprehensive major medical health insurance plans with reinsurance stop-loss coverage to safeguard against catastrophic losses when they occur. The Company’s management has determined not to implement as part of its services nor recommend the use of short-term medical plans, indemnity plans, and minimum essential coverage (MEC) plans as alternatives nor as solutions for small employers to give up using major medical comprehensive insurance plans because using other alternatives than major medical plans: (i) short-term medical plans, indemnity plans, and minimum essential coverage plans requires small employers and their employees to bear the risk should a catastrophic risk occur; and (ii) these plans are typically financially capped benefit policies that will not pay above the cap amount. The single main reason for bankruptcy filings in the United States is the result of indebtedness resulting from health and medical claims/charged regardless of whether the bankruptcy filer had some form of health insurance coverage or none.
 
It is important to note that over the past decade many small group employers and employees, in addition to purchasing health insurance from legacy carriers Blue Cross, Aetna, Anthem, Cigna, United Health, and other regional fully insured carriers (often referred to collectively as “BUCA”), are also deciding to purchase additional health coverages that are indemnity plans and not comprehensive major medical plans. These plans generally pay benefits the BUCA plans don’t or won’t cover, e.g., hospitalization, accident, and critical illness plans, dental and vision plans and all are NOT comprehensive major medical health insurance plans, but rather they only cover defined medical event costs associated with ever increasing high deductible medical plan limits that major medical plan coverages impose. Indemnity plans are being marketed to many that use the Affordable Care Act plans AKA ObamaCare plans.

The Company believes that by being able to provide comprehensive major medical health insurance program solutions for the small group employer market from one source, such as the Company, is a benefit offered by the Company to its target market which, the Company believes, will positively respond for its services. The main reasons for the Company’s belief in its ability to penetrate this target market is the fact that historically, more than 80% of small group employers have been forced to use non-competitive high-cost traditional major medical health plans at unsustainable high premium rate costs with ever-increasing member high deductible limits, that uses coinsurance, copays, and often provide less benefit coverages, especially mental health and Rx/drug formularies and limited provider networks. Our strategy has been to develop and provide transparency to health insurance benefits that includes: (i) a consumer driven health care model with value-based health plans that share financial rewards with our members and their providers; (ii) use prevention and wellness programs that complement our major medical health plans and use when possible using pre-tax dollars to pay for these services; (iii) provide tax free funding directly, indirectly and even through third parties to each employees qualified high deductible health plans health saving accounts (HSA), and ( iv) an open access provider network without punitive use of out of network providers. The Company’s focus and primary emphasis is to assist the small group employer market fund employee HSA which, despite considerable tax advantages and benefits to employers and employees have since their inception in 2004 by the US Congress been largely ignored by the BUCA’s. HSA have not been well funded despite more that 50 million employees owning HSA qualified health plans. Annual HSA contribution limits in 2019 were set at $3,500 for single employee plans and $7,000 for a family plan. Presently, legislation before the U.S. House of Representatives, if and when Congress brings to the floor and then requires U.S. Senate passage, of which there can be no assurance notwithstanding the change in Administration, proposes to double the annual contribution limits bringing HSA closer in line with 401-K annual contribution limits.
 
The Company has implemented several new sales and marketing programs to directly reach the small group employer market largely through its use of third-party staffing and support staffing companies. At the same time, the Company is furthering its plan to build and operate its own staffing business, which the Company estimates could take up to a year to implement at a cost expected to exceed several million dollars or more. As BUCA health insurance premium costs have risen substantially over the past decade and deemed unsustainable for small group employers, there is increased interest in supporting the known but misunderstood self-insurance major medical health benefits for the small group employer market making the Company’s timing to go to market very timely.
 
In order to successfully compete with the BUCAs, of which there can be no assurance, the Company benefit plans offering self-insured health plans and enhanced member support and customer service through strategic partnerships with innovative technology platforms that incorporate products and services under a single administrative team. It is our belief despite being relatively undercapitalized during the fiscal year-ended September 30, 2020, the six month March 31, 2021 and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2021 generated revenues of approximately $ 18 million and $28.7 million, respectively, albeit not yet experiencing positive cash-flow from operations due principally to losses on issuance of convertible debt, developing technology and expanding sales. The key elements based upon management’s experience, in determining which sales channels and markets to pursue are dependent on our continued ability to contract with third party vendors that provide our products and services and will commit resources in offering our products and services to their clients. The Company has already commenced sales and is continuing to pursue known targeted small group employer markets in the States of Texas, Florida, and many southern states whose laws and regulations favor our business strategy of competing with the established legacy carriers Blue Cross, Aetna, Anthem, Cigna and United Health (BUCAs), and other regional fully insured health insurance carriers.
 
The Company continues to target rural communities in those same states which must rely, to a large extent, on rural hospitals to attract and maintain economic growth which are having difficulties operating and where some hospitals have been and/or are planned to be closed. While we are yet to close specific projects related to this plan, the Company will continue to pursue its plans to create, in conjunction with rural hospitals, ‘community health exchanges’ whereby the hospitals contract with the Company to provide benefit and insurance services through its establish its staffing alternatives. Through the Company staffing it becomes the employer of record and staffs local employees and provide all their necessary employee services including major medical health insurance, payroll, HR, and financial programs.
 
We believe, but cannot be assured, that a substantial opportunity to sell and brand our services with rural hospitals should help to keep rural hospitals from closing. The Company is developing an Account Receivable (A/R) funding program for rural hospital where it can purchase BUCA and CMS claims receivables. The Company has had preliminary discussions with several funding sources interested in an A/R program since these medical receivables are deemed investment grade paper. Unless a suitable funding source can be found and contracted the A/R program cannot become reality as the Company doesn’t have adequate financial resources itself.

The Company believes that there exists a critical need for small business employers to be able to offer quality and sustainable employee benefits, especially with millennials, principally as a result of the fact that the federal government has not produced effective and affordable new health insurance programs for America’s small businesses. Since the 2008 financial crisis, small businesses have also been adversely affected by the fact that the banking institutions and particularly the large banks have not been providing small business employers with access to capital and credit markets. We believe that this lack of reliable credit and access to capital resources has resulted in the inability of small businesses to innovate and grow, which we believe is essential for small businesses to grow at a time that the American economy to continues to show signs of strength. Without access to adequate debt and/or equity capital, it is widely understood that small businesses have had to rely on their cash flow to manage their largest expenses which specifically include payroll, taxes and employee benefits, the latter of which has become increasingly unsustainable. The Company’s objective is to provide and facilitate the availability to small businesses of employee benefits and health insurance at manageable costs to reduce the unsustainable annual increases.
 
Despite the fact that in many states existing insurance and labor laws and regulations are more than adequate to support small group employers to self-insure their benefit and health insurance programs, the fact remains that the virtual monopoly of the large and established legacy carriers’ monopoly has had the effect of stifling alternative insurance and employee benefit solutions. The Company’s management believes that its innovative small employer benefits, self-insurance, and financial services programs are now market ready and provide substantial advantages not offered by established major insurance carriers and employee benefits managers that are not focusing on the small group employer/business market and gig economy workers which we firmly believe is and will increasingly be grow and dominate the economic landscape for decades to come. It is estimated that on an annual basis, small group employer annual premiums have exceeded $375 billion during the past several years, which we believe may be one of the largest markets lacking consumer/customer involvement and lacking transparency and competition. Our business plan is to service this market with transparency, providing small group employer market, largely through its use of third-party staffing and support staff companies, and directly through the Company’s own staffing business as it develops offer a sustainable full-service benefits and major medical health insurance solution to the gig economy workers.
 
Employees
 
The Company has 18 full-time employees, including its Chairman, CEO and Interim CFO, none of whom are under employment agreements. From time to time, the Company uses independent contractors and contract services for administrative functions such as legal, sales, IT, accounting, clerical, and bookkeeping services and expects to do so for the foreseeable future, until it generates positive cash flow from operations, of which there can be no assurance.
Government Regulations
 
The Company’s health insurance and employee benefits activities and financial services are subject to extensive federal, state and, to a lesser extent, local regulations. Each of the 50 States in the U.S. has adopted, by state statutes, laws and regulations, including those by the applicable State Departments of Insurance, Labor, Treasury, Health, Secretaries of State, among others. State laws and regulations govern health insurance and the issuance of insurance licensing to entities that offer medical and health insurance, sell health insurance and to otherwise provide insurance to the public, except for certain federal laws. The two most significant federal laws affecting health insurance and overriding state law are the Federal 1974 ERISA law and the passage by Congress in 2010 of the Affordable Care Act.( ObamaCare) However, state laws are so embedded and protected that despite the past fifty years of America’s industrial growth as the largest world economy, relatively few companies, given the size of the U.S. economy, are licensed to offer health insurance to businesses under the laws of the 50 states, without any meaningful oversight nor being subject to federal Sherman Act rules and regulations dealing with monopolistic practices. Furthermore, the Company believes that state law does not consider insurance companies to be deemed national enterprises subject to potential anti-trust regulations. In fact, more than thirty state licensed Blue Cross-Blue Shield companies, many of which are classified as not for profit entities, are deemed to exist as separate entities under each state jurisdiction, and therefore are not considered a monopoly.

Potential Advantages for the Company
 
The complexity of insurance regulations and lack of transparency to businesses in general and small businesses in particular, often require small and even mid-sized business to require outside professional assistance, which the Company believes presents the Company with the ability to enter the market and be successful in providing the requisite professional assistance. For the small group businesses who utilize federal ERISA law and with the technology advances that have developed for consumers via the internet revolution and smart phones, the Company believes that it is now an opportune time for innovation and change being offered by the Company’s insurance and employee benefits programs, providing the potential of compete successfully with the BUCA’s and for small group employers to switch from fully insured plans to self-insured plans. With the creation of the health saving account (HSA) in 2004, health and wealth can be driven when consumers drive health care with their money. Providers must be paid fair, fast and transparently and only consumers can accomplish this goal. Government cannot realistically or affordably displace 160,000,000 American workers from their private health insurance but it can encourage and support a private system where consumers are joined with their chosen doctors and have access to their medical records and can use pretax dollars for health expenses and save dollars tax advantaged for their retirement using employee-owned HSA. Notwithstanding the Company’s belief in its potential advantages and ability to successfully enter and generate profits operation in its target market, larger companies with significantly longer operating histories and far greater financial resources may enter this target market and offer services at rates more competitive than those offered by the Company.
