Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
Incorporated in 1989, Streamline Health Solutions, Inc. is a provider of solutions and services in the middle of the revenue cycle for healthcare providers throughout the United States and Canada. Streamline Health’s technology helps hospitals improve their financial performance by moving later revenue cycle interventions earlier in the process to optimize their coding accuracy for every patient encounter prior to bill submission. By improving coding accuracy before billing, providers can reduce revenue leakage, mitigate the risk of overbilling, and reduce days in accounts receivable. This enables providers to achieve more predictable revenue streams using technology rather than manual intervention.
 
The Company provides computer software-based solutions, professional consulting and auditing and coding services, which capture, aggregate, and translate structured and unstructured data to deliver intelligently organized, easily accessible predictive insights to its customers. Hospitals and physician groups use the knowledge generated by Streamline Health to help them improve their financial performance.
 
The Company’s software solutions are delivered to customers either by access to the Company’s data center systems through a secure connection in a software as a service (“SaaS”) delivery method or by a fixed-term or perpetual license, where such software is installed locally in the customer’s data center.
 
The Company operates exclusively in one segment as a provider of health information technology solutions and associated services that improve healthcare processes and information flows within a healthcare facility. The Company sells its solutions and services in North America to hospitals and health systems through its direct sales force and its reseller partnerships.
 
As part of the Company’s strategic expansion into the revenue cycle management, acute-care healthcare space, the Company acquired all of the equity interests of Avelead Consulting, LLC on August 16, 2021 on a cash- and debt-free basis.
 
Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Streamline Health,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” in this Report are intended to mean Streamline Health Solutions, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All references to a fiscal year refer to the fiscal year commencing February 1 in that calendar year and ending on January 31 of the following calendar year.
 
Solutions
 
The Company offers solutions and services to assist its customers in revenue cycle management including its two flagship technologies eValuatorTM and Avelead Rev ID™. eValuator provides 100% automated coding analysis prior to billing. Rev ID offers reconciliation of clinical activity to patient billing records prior to billing. In addition, the Company offers an array of professional services, including system implementation and coding audit solutions and other software solutions such as Coding and Clinical Documentation Improvement (CDI), Avelead Compare and Financial Management. The Company’s solutions and services are designed to improve the flow of critical patient information throughout the enterprise. The solutions and services help to transform and structure information between disparate information technology systems into actionable data, giving the end user comprehensive access to clinical and business intelligence to enhance billing accuracy and decision-making. Solutions can be accessed securely through SaaS or delivered either by a perpetual license or by a fixed-term license installed locally.
 
eValuator Coding Analysis Platform - This technology is a cloud-based SaaS analytics solution that delivers the capability of fully automated analysis on 100% of billing codes entered by a healthcare provider’s coding team. This is done on a pre-bill basis, enabling providers to identify and address their highest-impact cases prior to bill drop. Rule sets are enabled for inpatient, outpatient and pro-fee cases. With eValuator, providers can add an audit function on a pre-bill basis to all cases, allowing the provider to better optimize reimbursements and mitigate risk on its billing practices.
 
Avelead RevID Automated Revenue Reconciliation – RevID is a cloud-based SaaS automated charge reconciliation tool. RevID identifies discrepancies between a provider’s clinical and billing departments and ensures that every medical service is tracked, accounted for, and ultimately accurately billed thereby reducing revenue leakage. RevID functions on a pre-bill basis, allowing providers to catch mistakes and discrepancies prior to bill-drop.
 
Avelead Data Comparison Engine (“DCE”, “Avelead Compare”) – Avelead Compare is a cloud-based SaaS system synchronization module that compares different software hospitals use within their daily operations. Avelead Compare operates continuously and automates the comparison of multiple software systems to identify any discrepancies or errors occurring across all systems on a daily basis. Additionally, the Avelead Compare module can be utilized as a maintenance check when a hospital adds additional content or hires new physicians. It can also be utilized when a hospital converts to a new system within the hospital enabling transparent, continuous, up-to-date notifications as to what has been built and what needs to be built.

This suite of solutions includes individual workflows such as accounts receivable management, denials management, claims processing, spend management and audit management.
 
Patient Care Solution – Outside the Company’s primary focus of solutions in the middle of the revenue cycle for healthcare providers, the Company’s Clinical Analytics solution enables customers to improve their patient care via cohort building and data visualization, fostering an open, continuous learning culture inside a healthcare organization. Providers using Clinical Analytics are empowered with real-time, on-demand predicative insight for improved patient outcomes. The last customer on this product did not renew in June 2020, and accordingly, the Company has no revenue or cost associated with Patient Care Solutions since that date.

For more information regarding our major customers, please see “Risks Relating to Our Business - Our sales have been concentrated in a small number of customers” in Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” herein.
 
Acquisitions and Divestitures
 
The Company regularly evaluates opportunities for acquisitions and divestitures for portions of the Company that may not align with current growth strategies.
 
The Company acquired all of the equity interests of Avelead as part of the Company’s strategic expansion into the revenue cycle management, acute-care healthcare space. The acquisition was completed on August 16, 2021. The aggregate consideration for the purchase of Avelead was approximately $29.7 million (at fair value) consisting of (i) $12.5 million in cash, net of cash acquired, (ii) $6.5 million in common stock, and (iii) approximately $10.7 million in contingent consideration. The Company issued 5,021,972 shares of its restricted common stock to Avelead equity holders in connection with the acquisition. See Note 3 - Business Combination and Divestiture to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information regarding the acquisition.
 
The Company divested its legacy ECM Assets, effective February 24, 2020, in a transaction accounted for as a sale of assets. This sale of assets is consistent with the Company’s efforts to offer and invest in products that serve the middle of the revenue cycle, primarily for acute care healthcare organizations. The Company signed the definitive agreement with respect to the sale of the ECM Assets in December 2019 and prepared and filed a proxy statement to obtain stockholder approval of the transaction. We applied the standard of ASC 205-20-1 to ascertain the timing of accounting for the discontinued operations. Based on ASC 205-20-1, the Company determined that it did not have the authority to sell the assets until the date of the stockholder approval which was February 21, 2020. Accordingly, the Company did not present the ECM Assets as held for sale in previously filed financial statements. On February 21, 2020, the Company having the authority and ability to consummate the sale of the ECM Assets, met the criteria to present discontinued operations as described in ASC 205-20-1. Accordingly, the Company is reporting the results of operations and cash flows, and related balance sheet items associated with the ECM Assets in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and balance sheets for the current and comparative prior periods. See Note 13 – Discontinued Operations to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.
 
Business Segments
 
We manage our business as one single business segment. Under ASC 280-10-50-11, two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single operating segment if they are considered to be similar. Operating segments are considered to be similar if they can be expected to have essentially the same economic characteristics and future prospects. Using the aggregation guidance, the Company determined that it has one operating segment due to the similar economic characteristics of the Company’s products, product development, distribution, regulatory environment and customer base as a provider of computer software-based solutions and services for acute-care healthcare providers. The Company has two reporting units for evaluation of intangible assets, Streamline Solutions and Avelead Solutions. For our total assets at January 31, 2022 and 2021 and total revenue and net loss for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 and 2021, see our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” herein.
Contracts, License and Services Fees
 
The Company enters into agreements with its customers that specify the scope of the system to be installed and/or services to be provided by the Company, as well as the agreed-upon pricing, applicable term duration and the timetable for the associated licenses and services.
 
For customers purchasing software to be installed locally or provided on a SaaS model, these are multi-element arrangements that include either a perpetual or term license and right to access the applicable software functionality (whether installed locally at the customer site or the right to use the Company’s solutions as a part of SaaS services), terms regarding maintenance and support services, and professional services for implementation, integration, process engineering, optimization and training, as well as fees and payment terms for each of the foregoing. If the customer purchases solutions on a perpetual license model, the customer is billed the license fee up front. Maintenance and support is provided on a term basis for separate fees, with an initial term typically from one to five years in length. The maintenance and support fee is charged annually in advance, commencing either upon contract execution or deployment of the solution in live production. If the customer purchases solutions on a term-based model, the customer is billed periodically a combined access fee for a specified term, typically from one to seven years in length. The access fee includes the access rights along with all maintenance and support services.
 
The Company also generally provides software and SaaS customers professional services for implementation, integration, process engineering, optimization and training. These services and the associated fees are separate from the license, maintenance and access fees. Professional services are provided on either a fixed-fee or hourly arrangements billable to customers based on agreed-to payment milestones (fixed fee) or monthly payment structure on hours incurred (hourly). These services can either be included at the time the related locally installed software or SaaS solution is licensed as part of the initial purchase agreement or added as an addendum to the existing agreement for services required after the initial implementation. The Company recognizes revenue for implementation for certain of its eValuator SaaS solution over the contract term, as it has been determined that those implementation services are not a distinct performance obligation, whereas for other SaaS and Software solutions such as CDI, RevID and Compare, it has been determined that its implementation services are a distinct performance obligation and, accordingly, are recognized separately as professional services.

For coding audit services customers, these review services are provided either through a stand-alone services agreement or services addendum to an existing master agreement with the customer. These review services are available as either a one-time service or recurring monthly, quarterly or annual review structure. These services are typically provided on a per reviewed account/chart basis. Monthly minimums are required where material discounts have been offered. Payment typically occurs upon completion of the applicable review project.
 
The commencement of revenue recognition varies depending on the size and complexity of the system and/or services involved, the implementation or performance schedule requested by the customer and usage by customers of SaaS for software-based components. The Company’s agreements are generally non-cancellable but provide that the customer may terminate its agreement upon a material breach by the Company and/or or may delay certain aspects of the installation or associated payments in such events. The Company does allow for termination for convenience in certain situations. Therefore, it is difficult for the Company to accurately predict the revenue it expects to achieve in any particular period, and a termination or installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement, or the failure of the Company to procure additional agreements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations, as further discussed in Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” herein. Historically, the Company has not experienced a material amount of contract cancellations; however, the Company sometimes experiences delays in the course of contract performance and the Company accounts for them accordingly.
 
Third-Party License Fees
 
The Company incorporates software licensed from various third-party vendors into its proprietary software. The Company licenses these software products and pays the required license fees when such software is delivered to customers.
Associates
 
As of January 31, 2022, the Company had 134 employees; a net increase of 67 employees during fiscal 2021. Of this increase in employees, 59 were part of the Avelead acquisition. All employees are full-time employees. The Company utilizes independent contractors to supplement its staff, as needed. None of the Company’s associates are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The Company has never experienced a work stoppage and believes that its employee relations are good. The Company’s success depends, to a significant degree, on its management, sales and technical personnel.
 
For more information on contracts, backlog, acquisitions and research and development, see also Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
 
Competition
 
The eValuator product has little direct competition. The Company believes it is an industry leader in pre-bill auditing technology. We have seen competition on similar products that are being utilized by customers as a pre-bill auditing tool, such as PwC Smart and 3M, however, these similar products are intended to be utilized for post-bill auditing which is a different workflow than what is necessary for pre-bill auditing. We expect to have competition in the pre-bill technology industry. Customer processes dictates that correcting errors prior to billing is much more efficient and effective than having an audit after billing. There will be larger and more sophisticated competitors than our Company. Accordingly, using the time we have without direct competition is critical to the Company’s success.
 
The RevID product has little direct competition. The Company believes RevID’s automated charge reconciliation technique, and the frequency of charge reconciliation RevID enables are unique in the industry. There are products that purport to provide similar services, including nThrive’s Charge Capture Audit Tool and CloudMed’s ReVint Tool set. The Company anticipates that additional competition may develop as pre-bill, daily charge reconciliation becomes a standard within the industry.
 
The Avelead DCE product has little direct competition. The Company believes that few engines exist that can accurately compare the various software systems used by hospitals, examples of other products include Vitalware, Craneware and nThrive’s Chargemaster toolkit. DCE is unique in that it can be easily tuned to work with a wide array of hospital systems to create a bespoke offering for specific clients, easing transitions to new platforms or as an ongoing maintenance check tool.
 
Regarding our Coding and CDI Solutions, eValuator Coding Analysis Platform, and Financial Management Solutions, several companies historically have dominated the clinical information system software market. The industry is undergoing consolidation and realignment as companies position themselves to compete more effectively. Strategic alliances between vendors of other healthcare systems are increasing. Barriers to entry to this market include technological and application sophistication, the ability to offer a proven product, creating and utilizing a well-established customer base and distribution channels, brand recognition, the ability to operate on a variety of operating systems and hardware platforms, the ability to integrate with pre-existing systems and capital for sustained development and marketing activities. The Company has many competitors including clinical information system vendors that are larger, more established and have substantially more resources than the Company.

Regarding our Audit Services, there are numerous medium and small companies and independent consultants who offer these services. Barriers to entry to this market include creating and utilizing a well-established customer base and distribution channels, brand recognition, establishing differentiators for our services and capital for sustained development and marketing activities.
 
The Company believes that these obstacles taken together represent a moderate to high-level barrier to entry. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are customer recommendations and references, company reputation, system reliability, system features and functionality (including ease of use), technological advancements, customer service and support, breadth and quality of the systems, the potential for enhancements and future compatible products, the effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts, price, and the size and perceived financial stability of the vendor. In addition, the Company believes that the speed with which companies in its market can anticipate the evolving healthcare industry structure and identify unmet needs are important competitive factors.
 
Additional Intellectual Property Rights
 
In addition to the software licenses described in other sections of this Item 1, “Business”, the Company also holds registered trademarks for its Streamline Health® and other key trademarks used in selling its products. These marks are currently active, with registrations being valid for a period of 3 years each. The Company actively renews these marks at the end of each registration period.
Regulation
 
Our customers derive a substantial portion of their revenue from third-party private and governmental payors, including through Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored programs. Our customers also have express handling and retention obligations under information-based laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. There are no material regulatory proposals of which the Company is aware that we believe currently have a high likelihood of passage that we anticipate would have a material impact on the operation or demand of the Company’s products and services. However, the Company acknowledges there is currently great uncertainty in the U.S. healthcare market, generally, from a regulatory perspective. In addition, there is regulatory uncertainty in the data and technology sectors as it relates to information security regulations. Material changes could have unanticipated impact on demand or usability of the Company’s solutions, require the Company to incur additional development and/or operating costs (on a one-time or recurring basis) or cause customers to terminate their agreements or otherwise be unable to pay amounts owed to the Company, as further discussed in Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” herein.
Environmental Matters
 
We believe we are compliant in all material aspects with all applicable environmental laws. We do not anticipate that such compliance will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of our operations.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
 
We have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that guides and binds each of our employees, officers and directors which is available on the “Investor Relations” page of our website, www.streamlinehealth.net, under the “Corporate Governance” tab. We use an anonymous compliance hotline for employees and outside parties to report potential instances of noncompliance.
