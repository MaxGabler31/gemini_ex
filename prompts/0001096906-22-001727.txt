Development of Scanner Technology Business
 
Defense Technologies International Corp.’s (the “Company”) subsidiary PSSI acquired the world-wide exclusive rights to the Passive Security Scan™ a ‘next generation, walk-through personnel scanning system. This patented product (US Patent: 7408461) is an advanced passive scanning technology for detection and identifying concealed threats to be used for the security of schools and other public venues. PSSI has the exclusive World-Wide license to manufacture and sell the Passive Scanning Technology™. We added a Camera for the detection of Elevated Body Temperatures (EBT), our first products are:
 Passive Portal™, Passive Portal™ EBT, Passive EBT Station 
 
On October 19, 2016, the Company entered into a Definitive Agreement with Controlled Capture Systems, LLC ("CCS"), representing the inventor of the technology and assets that included
 a new exclusive Patent License Agreement and Independent Contractor agreement.  Under the license agreement with CCS, the Company acquired the world-wide exclusive rights and privileges to the CCS security technology, patents, products and improvements.  The term of the License Agreement shall be from October 19, 2016, until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed issued patents or patents to be issued.
 
The Company agreed to pay CCS an initial licensing fee of $25,000 and to pay ongoing royalties at the end of each six-month period at the rate of the greater of 5% of gross sales used or sold, or the minimum royalty payment of $25,000. The Company also agreed to compensate investors that have provided funding for the development of CCS's technology with 5 shares of the Company's common stock.  Additionally, CCS will be entitled to receive 1 shares of the Company's common stock upon completed sales of 1,000 passive scanner units based on the CCS technology. On December 14, 2017, the Company issued 20,000 shares of Series B preferred stock to Controlled Capture Systems, LLC to extend the exclusive rights to the Passive Security Scan to March 15, 2018.
 
On May 30, 2018, the Company and Control Capture Systems, LLC amended their license agreement as follows:
 1.
Royalty payments of 5% of gross sale from the license agreement will be calculated and paid quarterly with a minimum of $12,500 paid each quarter. 
 2.
All payment will be in US dollars or stock of the Company and or its subsidiary. The value of the stock will be a discount to market of 25% of the average trading price for the 10 days prior to conversion.

The Company capitalized the costs to acquire the License Agreement, including the $25,000 initial licensing fee and the estimated value of $353,600 of the 5shares of the Company's common stock issued on November 10, 2016, to the CCS investors, which value was based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of the Definitive Agreement. The Company recorded a current liability of $36,000 for the remaining obligation in its consolidated balance sheet as of April 30, 2019.  Once sales of products based on the CCS technology begin, the Company will amortize the capitalized costs over the estimated life of the license agreement as determined by the legal life of patents issued. To date no sales of the product have been completed. The Company reviewed the valuation of the license agreement and determined to impair the asset of $378,600.
 
Effective January 12, 2017, Passive Security Scan, Inc. ("PSSI") was incorporated in the state of Utah as a wholly owned subsidiary.  The Company merged its wholly owned subsidiary, Long Canyon Gold Resources Corp. ("Long Canyon"), into PSSI, with PSSI the surviving entity.  The Company transferred to PSSI its exclusive world-wide license to the defense, detection and protection security products previously acquired by the Company.  The Company currently owns 76.28% of PSSI with 23.72% acquired by several individuals and entities.  With the merger of Long Canyon into PSSI, the Company discontinued its mineral exploration business. The Company concluded the initial development of the technology and will proceed to put the system through the required Beta Test at a high school near Austin Tx. All sales and marketing activities will be executed through PSSI.
 
The security products licensed from CCS as developed by the Company are designed for personal and collateral protection.  The proposed detection technology is intended to provide passive security scanning units for either walk-through or hand-held use to improve security for schools and other public facilities.  The units use electromagnets and do not emit anything (such as x-rays) through the subject.  The Company, in consultation with CCS, recently completed a prototype with optional “Digital Imaging” which will give the user of the scanner the ability to recall the entire traffic passing through the scanner at any time thereafter. The prototype scanner unit has successfully passed elaborate lab testing and is ready for deployment and demonstration.
 
Competition
 
We believe we have the only known passive scanner technology based on earth magnetic technology that does not cause any harm to the subject passing through the scanner. Our scanners are therefore uniquely suited for school systems and other public venues. Our competitors’ technology is based on X-Ray, microwave or radio signals, all of which are harmful over time. We believe this provides an advantage to our scanners over those developed by our competition. 
Sales and Marketing
 
On November 04, 2020, we engaged the services of Jonathan Silver of Cumulus Media Inc of Atlanta GA to assist DTII in Investors Relations and Marketing of its Passive Portal and EBT Station.
 
Through our National Marketing Director. Mr. Jonathan Silver, we have made contact with schools, synagogues as well as other venue holders that have expressed interest in having the Passive Security Scan Unit presented at the school for demonstration and evaluation. Furthermore, as funding permits, we plan to install a demonstration unit in every state free of charge via the state’s Governor’s Office. We expect major exposure through this program.
 
Jonathan Silver arranged the installation of Demo-Units of the Passive Portal and the EBT Camera (elevated body temperature) at the Coastal Carolina University, Convey SC; Florence County Sheriff’s Detention Center, Effingham, SC; Myrtle Beach Police Department Detention Center, Myrtle Beach, SC.
 
We have signed three Distributorship Agreements. A distributor will get a 20% discount on Gross Sales but is required to purchase a minimum of 25 units at time of signing for a distributorship. General referrals will earn a 10% discount.
 
With the completion of requisite funding, we expect to place the first units during the fall of 2021 and commence a major marketing campaign at the same time. We believe that we will start production and sales within the coming three to six months.
 
With the start of initial sales, we believe that we will be able to raise major funding through more conventional sources for our production.
