Item 1.  Business.
Overview
 We are a holding company seeking to acquire assets and businesses, where our people and other assets provide a competitive advantage.  We currently have four business operating segments: durable medical equipment, investment management, real estate, and general corporate.
 Our goal is to build a diversified holding company focused on generating attractive, risk-adjusted returns on investment and long-term value creation.  We intend to accomplish this principally through:
  
▪ | continuous review of acquisitions of businesses, securities and assets that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and exhibit the potential for significant long-term value creation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | effective use of the skills of our team and our financial resources, including our tax assets, our willingness to create bespoke solutions and our ability to prudently assume risks; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | constant evaluation of the retention and disposition of our operations and holdings.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In recent years, we have made a number of changes in our business:
  
▪ | During the year ended June 30, 2017, we:
--+-----------------------------------------


▪ | established our investment management business and became the investment manager to GECC through our wholly-owned subsidiary Great Elm Capital Management, Inc. (GECM); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | completed a backstopped rights offering for approximately $45.0 million of proceeds, before deducting offering costs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | During the year ended June 30, 2018, we:
--+-----------------------------------------


▪ | commenced our real estate business and determined that it was a separate reportable segment; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | expanded our investment management business with agreements to provide investment management services to separate accounts for an institutional investor.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | During the year ended June 30, 2019, we:
--+-----------------------------------------


▪ | launched a new credit focused fund, Great Elm Opportunities Fund I, LP (GEOF), with a mandate to invest across the capital structure in niche, small and middle market opportunities with a catalyst for value-realization;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | commenced our durable medical equipment business and determined that it was a separate reportable segment; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | subsequently, expanded our durable medical equipment business through the acquisition of certain operations of Midwest Respiratory Care, Inc.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately $1.6 billion of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes.
 Our Durable Medical Equipment Business
 In September 2018, we launched our durable medical equipment segment by acquiring two durable medical equipment businesses that specialize in the distribution of respiratory care equipment, including positive air pressure equipment and supplies, ventilators and oxygen equipment, and provide sleep study services.

Our Investment Management Business
 We decided to invest in the asset management business because of our assessment of its ability to generate recurring free cash flows, its growth prospects and our Board of Directors’ (our Board) and employees’ industry expertise.  GECM, our wholly-owned registered investment adviser subsidiary, is an investment adviser providing investment management services to GECC, our largest investment vehicle, as well as GEOF and separate accounts for an institutional investor.  The combined assets under management for these entities as of June 30, 2019 was approximately $273.5 million.
 Our BDC, GECC, was established in 2016.  At this time, GECC elected to be treated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act).  We own approximately 19.5% of GECC’s shares that we may hold to generate dividends or sell to redeploy our capital in higher yielding opportunities.
 GECM earns revenue through investment management agreements with each investment vehicle which provide for management fees, incentive fees and/or administrative fees.  These fees are generally based on assets under management, investment performance and allocable expenses incurred in the administration of these investment vehicles.
 Our Real Estate Business
 We launched our real estate business in March 2018 with an investment in a majority-interest in two Class A office buildings totaling 257,000 square feet situated on 17 acres of land in Fort Myers, Florida (collectively, the Property).  The Property is fully-leased, on a triple-net basis, to a single tenant through March 31, 2030.
 For additional information see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 Acquisition Program
 GEC’s team continues to monitor and identify opportunities in the durable medical equipment, investment management, real estate and other sectors through the acquisition of operating businesses.  In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we evaluated a number of opportunities in these areas.
Competition
 We face competition from larger, well financed organizations (both domestic and foreign), including operating companies, global asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, private equity funds, sovereign wealth funds and state-owned enterprises.  Government regulation is a key competitive factor for certain industries.
Employees
 We had 328 employees as of June 30, 2019, including the 317 employees of our durable medical equipment subsidiaries added during the 2019 fiscal year in connection with the durable medical equipment business acquisitions.
