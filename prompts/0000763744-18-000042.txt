Item 1.    BUSINESS.
Summary
LCI Industries (“LCII” and collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or the “Registrant”), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lippert Components, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Lippert Components” or “LCI”), supplies, domestically and internationally, a broad array of components for the leading original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of recreational vehicles (“RVs”) and adjacent industries including buses; trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo; trucks; pontoon boats; trains; manufactured homes; and modular housing. The Company also supplies components to the related aftermarkets of these industries, primarily by selling to retail dealers, wholesale distributors and service centers.
LCI’s products include steel chassis and related components; axles and suspension solutions; slide-out mechanisms and solutions; thermoformed bath, kitchen and other products; vinyl, aluminum and frameless windows; manual, electric and hydraulic stabilizer and leveling systems; entry, luggage, patio and ramp doors; furniture and mattresses; electric and manual entry steps; awnings and awning accessories; electronic components; appliances; televisions and sound systems; navigation systems; backup cameras; and other accessories.
The Company has two reportable segments: the original equipment manufacturers segment (the “OEM Segment”) and the aftermarket segment (the “Aftermarket Segment”). The OEM Segment accounted for 92 percent of consolidated net sales for 2017, and the Aftermarket Segment accounted for 8 percent of consolidated net sales for 2017. Approximately 71 percent of the Company’s OEM Segment net sales in 2017 were of products sold to manufacturers of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs.
The Company is focused on profitable growth in its industries, both organic and through acquisitions. In order to support this growth, over the past several years the Company has expanded its geographic market and product lines, consolidated manufacturing facilities, and integrated manufacturing, distribution and administrative functions. At December 31, 2017, the Company operated over 50 manufacturing and distribution facilities located throughout the United States and in Canada and Italy, and reported consolidated net sales of $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on March 20, 1984, and is the successor to Drew National Corporation, which was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1962. The Company’s principal executive and administrative offices are located at 3501 County Road 6 East, Elkhart, Indiana 46514; telephone number (574) 535-1125; website www.lci1.com; e-mail LCII@lci1.com. The Company makes available free of charge on its website its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K (and amendments to those reports) filed or furnished with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed or furnished.
Recent Developments
Sales and Profits
Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to a record $2.1 billion, 28 percent higher than the consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $1.7 billion. Acquisitions completed by the Company in 2017 added $42 million in net sales. An 18 percent increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs, the Company’s primary OEM market, as well as increased content per RV unit, positively impacted net sales growth. Further, the Company organically increased sales to adjacent industries and the aftermarket. 
Net income for the full-year 2017 increased to $132.9 million, or $5.24 per diluted share, up from net income of $129.7 million, or $5.20 per diluted share, in 2016. Net income in 2017 included a one-time non-cash charge of $13.2 million ($0.52 per diluted share) related to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”). Excluding the estimated impact of the TCJA, adjusted net income was $146.1 million, or $5.76 per diluted share, in 2017 compared with $129.7 million, or $5.20 per diluted share, in 2016. Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Measures” included in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information regarding the Company's use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Customer Concentrations
Thor Industries, Inc. (“Thor”), a customer of both segments, accounted for 38 percent, 37 percent and 28 percent of the Company’s consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (through its subsidiaries Forest River, Inc. and Clayton Homes, Inc.), a customer of both segments, accounted for 25 percent, 26 percent and 26 percent of the Company’s consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Jayco, Inc., a customer of both segments, accounted for 10 percent of the Company’s consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, this customer was subsequently acquired by Thor and is included in the Thor’s 2017 and 2016 percentages above. No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated net sales in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. International sales, primarily in Europe and Australia, and export sales represented approximately 4 percent, 2 percent and 1 percent of consolidated net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Acquisitions
During 2017 and early 2018, the Company completed five acquisitions:
In February 2017, the Company acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of SessaKlein S.p.A. (“SessaKlein”), a manufacturer of highly engineered side window systems for both high speed and commuter trains, located near Varese, Italy. The purchase price was $8.5 million paid at closing, plus contingent consideration based on future sales by this operation.
In May 2017, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of Lexington LLC (“Lexington”), a manufacturer of high quality seating solutions for the marine, RV, transportation, medical and office furniture industries located in Elkhart, Indiana. The purchase price was $40.1 million paid at closing.
In June 2017, the Company acquired 100 percent of the equity interests of Metallarte S.r.l. (“Metallarte”), a manufacturer of entry and compartment doors for the European caravan market located near Siena, Italy, and its subsidiary, RV Doors, S.r.l., a manufacturer of driver-side doors located near Venice, Italy. The purchase price was $14.1 million paid at closing, plus contingent consideration based on future sales by this operation. 
In January 2018, the Company acquired 100 percent of the equity interests of Taylor Made Group, LLC (“Taylor Made”), a marine supplier to boat builders and the aftermarket, as well as a key supplier to a host of other industrial end markets, located in Gloversville, New York. The preliminary purchase price was $88.9 million paid at closing.
In February 2018, the Company acquired substantially all of the business assets of Hehr International Inc. (“Hehr”), a manufacturer of windows and tempered and laminated glass for the RV, transit, specialty vehicle, and other adjacent industries, headquartered in Los Angeles, California. The preliminary purchase price was $49.9 million paid at closing.
Other Developments
In February 2018, the Company exercised its right to increase the maximum borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement from $200 million to $325 million. 
In December 2016, the Company announced a change of the Company’s corporate name to LCI Industries from Drew Industries Incorporated. Lippert Components’ business has grown considerably over the past decade, and the new corporate name was selected to better align the investment community with the strength of the LCI brand in the industries it serves.
OEM Segment
Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company manufactures or distributes a broad array of components for the leading OEMs of RVs and adjacent industries, including buses; trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo; trucks; pontoon boats; trains; manufactured homes; and modular housing.
In 2017, the OEM Segment represented 92 percent of the Company’s consolidated net sales and 89 percent of consolidated segment operating profit. Approximately 71 percent of the Company’s OEM Segment net sales in 2017 were of products to manufacturers of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs. RVs may be motorized (motorhomes) or towable (travel trailers, fifth-wheel travel trailers, folding camping trailers and truck campers).
7

Raw materials used by the Company’s OEM Segment, consisting primarily of steel (coil, sheet, tube and I-beam), extruded aluminum, glass, wood, fabric and foam are available from a number of sources, both domestic and foreign.
Operations of the Company’s OEM Segment consist primarily of fabricating, welding, thermoforming, painting, sewing and assembling components into finished products. The Company’s OEM Segment operations are conducted at over 50 manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the United States, and in Canada and Italy, strategically located in proximity to the customers they serve. See Item 2. “Properties.”
The Company’s OEM Segment products are sold primarily to major manufacturers of RVs such as Thor Industries, Inc. (symbol: THO), Forest River, Inc. (a Berkshire Hathaway company, symbol: BRKA), Winnebago Industries, Inc. (symbol: WGO) and other RV OEMs, and to manufacturers in adjacent industries.
The RV industry is highly competitive, both among manufacturers of RVs and the suppliers of RV components, generally with low barriers to entry other than compliance with industry standards, codes and safety requirements, and the initial capital investment required to establish manufacturing operations. The Company competes with several other component suppliers on a regional and national basis with respect to a broad array of components for both towable and motorized RVs. The Company’s operations compete on the basis of product quality and reliability, product innovation, price, customer service and customer satisfaction. Although definitive information is not readily available, the Company believes it is a leading supplier for towable RVs for the following principal RV products:

● windows, | ● axles, 
● doors, | ● furniture, 
● chassis, | ● leveling systems, and 
● slide-out mechanisms, | ● awnings. 

In addition to LCI, Dexter Axle Company is also a leading supplier of axles and Carefree of Colorado and Dometic Corporation are also leading suppliers of awnings. 
OEM Segment net sales to adjacent industries increased 24 percent from $332 million in 2016 to $411 million in 2017, or 21 percent of total OEM Segment net sales in both periods. The Company’s market share for its products in adjacent industries cannot be readily determined; however, the Company continues to make investments in people, technology and equipment and is committed to expanding its presence in these industries.
Detailed narrative information about the results of operations of the OEM Segment is included in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Financial information relating to the Company’s business segments is included in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.
Aftermarket Segment
Many of the Company’s OEM Segment products are also sold through various aftermarket channels, including dealerships, warehouse distributors and service centers, as well as direct to retail customers. The Company has teams dedicated to product training and marketing support for its Aftermarket customers. The Company also supports two call centers to provide quick responses to customers for both product delivery and technical support. This support is designed for a rapid response to critical repairs so customer downtime is minimized. The Aftermarket Segment also includes the sale of replacement glass and awnings to fulfill insurance claims. Many of the optional upgrades and non-critical replacements are purchased outside the normal product selling seasons, thereby causing Aftermarket sales to be counter-seasonal.
According to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (“RVIA”), estimated RV ownership has increased to over nine million units. Additionally, as a result of a vibrant secondary market, one third of current owners purchased their RV new while the remaining two-thirds purchased a previously owned RV. This vibrant secondary market is a key driver for aftermarket sales, as the Company anticipates owners of previously owned RVs will likely upgrade their units as well as replace parts and accessories which have been subjected to normal wear and tear.
Aftermarket Segment net sales increased from $131 million in 2016 to $171 million in 2017. The Company continues to make investments in people and technology to grow the Aftermarket Segment and is committed to continue these expansion efforts.

Detailed narrative information about the results of operations of the Aftermarket Segment is included in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Financial information relating to the Company’s business segments is included in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.
Sales and Marketing
The Company’s sales activities are related to developing new customer relationships and maintaining existing customer relationships, primarily through the quality and reliability of its products, innovation, price, customer service and customer satisfaction. As a result of the Company’s strategic decision to increase its sales to the aftermarket and adjacent industries, as well as expand into international markets, the Company has increased its annual marketing and advertising expenditures over the past few years, which were $3.2 million in 2017.
The Company has several supply agreements or other arrangements with certain of its customers that provide for prices of various products to be fixed for periods generally not in excess of eighteen months; however, in certain cases the Company has the right to renegotiate the prices on sixty-days’ notice. Both the OEM Segment and the Aftermarket Segment typically ship products on average within one to two weeks of receipt of orders from their customers and, as a result, neither segment has any significant backlog.
Capacity
At December 31, 2017, the Company operated over 50 manufacturing and distribution facilities across the U.S. and in Canada and Italy. In 2017, the Company’s facilities operated at an average of approximately 55 percent of their practical capacity, assuming at least two shifts of production at all facilities. Capacity by facility varies significantly based on seasonal demand, as well as by product line and geographic region, with certain facilities at times operating below 50 percent utilization, and other facilities at times operating above 90 percent utilization. For most products, the Company has the ability to fill excess demand by shifting production to other facilities, usually at an increased cost. The ability to adjust capacity in certain product areas through lean manufacturing and automation initiatives, reallocation of existing resources and/or additional capital expenditures is monitored regularly by management in an effort to achieve a high level of production efficiency and return on invested capital. Capital expenditures for 2017 were $87 million, which included approximately $45 million for growth, lean and automation initiatives, and approximately $42 million of replacement capital expenditures. 
Seasonality
Most industries where the Company sells products or where its products are used, historically have been seasonal and generally at the highest levels when the weather is moderate. Accordingly, the Company’s sales and profits have generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. However, because of fluctuations in dealer inventories, the impact of international, national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on retail sales of RVs and other products for which the Company sells its components, the timing of dealer orders, as well as the impact of severe weather conditions on the timing of industry-wide shipments from time to time, current and future seasonal industry trends may be different than in prior years. Additionally, sales of certain components to the aftermarket channels of these industries tend to be counter-seasonal.
International
Over the past several years, the Company has been gradually growing international sales, primarily in Europe and Australia, and export sales represented approximately 4 percent, 2 percent and 1 percent of consolidated net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company continues to focus on developing products tailored for international RV markets. The Company participates in the largest RV shows in Europe and has been receiving positive feedback on its products, especially its proprietary slide-out products. The Company’s Director of International Business Development spends time in Australia, Europe and other international markets, assessing the dynamics of the local marketplace, building relationships with OEMs and helping the Company introduce its existing products and develop new products for those markets, with the goal of identifying long-term growth opportunities. The Company estimates the addressable market for annual net sales of its products outside of North America to be over $1 billion.
In May 2016, the Company acquired Project 2000 S.r.l., a manufacturer of motorized entry steps, bed lifts and RV accessories located near Florence, Italy, as a foundation for LCI in the European RV market. In February 2017, the Company acquired SessaKlein S.p.A., a manufacturer of highly engineered side window systems for both high speed and commuter trains located near Varese, Italy. The acquisition of SessaKlein introduced the Company to a new adjacent industry for the European and U.S. train markets, and, the Company believes, will accelerate the opportunities to expand LCI's product offerings for the European RV market. In June 2017, the Company acquired Metallarte S.r.l., a manufacturer of entry and compartment doors for the European 
9

caravan market with locations near Siena and Venice, Italy. In January 2018, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of Taylor Made Group, LLC, a leading supplier to the recreational marine industry, which also provides products to numerous other industries including agriculture, construction, powersports, mass transit, emergency, utility, golf, automotive industries and more. Taylor Made Group, LLC is headquartered in Gloversville, New York, and also has locations in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Intellectual Property
The Company holds approximately 200 United States and foreign patents and has approximately 60 patent applications pending that relate to various products sold by the Company. The Company has also granted certain licenses that permit third parties to manufacture and sell products in consideration for royalty payments. 
From time to time, the Company has received notices or claims it may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of others, and the Company has given notices to, or asserted claims against, others that they may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of the Company. The Company believes its patents are valuable and vigorously protects its patents when appropriate.
Research and Development
The Company strives to be an industry leader in product innovation and is focused on developing new products, as well as improving existing products. Research and development expenditures are expensed as they are incurred. Research and development expenses were approximately $14 million, $9 million and $8 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations governing the manufacture and sale of our products. Sales and manufacturing operations in foreign countries may be subject to similar regulations.
Rules promulgated under the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation Act (the “Tread Act”) require manufacturers of motor vehicles and certain motor vehicle related equipment to regularly make reports and submit documents and certain historical data to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) of the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to enhance motor vehicle safety, and to respond to requests for information relating to specific complaints or incidents.

Thermoformed bath products manufactured by the Company for manufactured homes must comply with performance and construction regulations promulgated by HUD.
The Company believes it is currently operating in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations and has made reports and submitted information as required. The Company does not believe the expense of compliance with these 
10

laws and regulations, as currently in effect, will have a material effect on the Company's operations, financial condition or competitive position; however, there can be no assurance this trend will continue as health and safety laws, regulations or other pertinent requirements evolve.
Environmental
The Company’s operations are subject to certain federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to the use, storage, discharge, transport and disposal of hazardous materials used during the manufacturing processes. Although the Company believes its operations have been consistent with prevailing industry standards, and are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, one or more of the Company’s current or former operating sites, or adjacent sites owned by third-parties, have been affected by releases of hazardous materials. As a result, the Company may incur expenditures for future investigation and remediation of these sites, including in conjunction with voluntary remediation programs or third party claims. In the past, environmental compliance costs have not had, and are not expected in the future to have, a material effect on the Company’s operations or financial condition; however, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had 9,852 full-time employees. None of the employees of the Company are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes that relations with its employees are good.
