---------+---------

 The following description of our business is current as of December 31, 2018 and does not give effect to or incorporate any subsequent events unless otherwise noted. 
 Overview
 We develop programs and solutions that motivate and inspire loyalty. Through our proprietary technology platforms and end-to-end customer service capabilities, we design, administer and fulfill loyalty and customer engagement programs and solutions that strengthen and expand the value of customer relationships for many of the world’s largest and most respected companies. Our programs and solutions include:

• | Loyalty solutions that help reward, motivate and retain consumers. We create and manage any and all aspects of our clients’ points-based loyalty programs, including design, platform, analytics, points management and fulfillment. Our loyalty solutions offer relevant, best-in-class rewards (such as travel, gift cards and merchandise) to consumers enabling clients to motivate, retain and thank their best customers. For example, our platform and technology support points-based programs for financial services, automotive, gaming, travel and hospitality companies.

• | Customer engagement programs and solutions that address key consumer needs such as greater peace of mind and meaningful savings for everyday purchases. We provide these solutions to leading companies in the financial institution, telecommunications, ecommerce, retail and travel sectors globally. These differentiated programs help our clients enrich their offerings to drive deeper connections with their customers, and to encourage their customers to engage more, stay loyal and generate more revenue for our clients. For example, we develop and manage programs such as identity theft protection, credit monitoring, savings on everyday purchases, concierge services, discount travel services and roadside assistance.

 The Company had a domestic insurance business that served as a leading third-party agent, administrator and marketer of certain accident and life insurance solutions. As discussed further in Note 4—Discontinued Operations in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein, we completed the sale of the domestic insurance business, which comprised substantially all of our Insurance Solutions operating segment, on August 15, 2018. The divestiture of the domestic insurance business marked an additional step in our strategic plan and ongoing transformation into a pure-play loyalty solutions company.
 Our financial business model is characterized by substantial recurring revenues. We generate revenue primarily in three ways:
  
• | Fee for service: we generate revenues from our clients through our loyalty business by designing (management, analytics and customer experience) and administering points-based loyalty programs on a platform licensing, fee-for-service basis. We also generate revenues for desired customer engagement programs and solutions, typically through a licensing and/or per-user fee.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Commission or transaction fee: we earn a commission from our suppliers and/or a transaction fee from our clients based on volume for enabling or executing transactions such as fees generated from loyalty points related purchases and redemption. We can also generate revenues based on a per-subscriber and/or a per-activity commission fee from our clients for our services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Subscription: we generate revenues through the sale of our value-added subscription-based programs and solutions to the customers of our clients whom we bill on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had net revenues, net income attributable to us and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) of $699.8 million, $302.1 million and $147.8 million, respectively.
 On April 10, 2019, we consummated the 2019 Recapitalization, as defined and described below under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—2019 Recapitalization” and Note 22—Subsequent Events in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.  
 Business
 We seek to address the needs of three primary parties in developing and implementing our loyalty and customer engagement programs and solutions: (1) Clients, which are the companies for whom we develop and manage loyalty and customer engagement programs and solutions; (2) Customers, who are the individual consumers with whom we or our clients have a relationship and either subscribe to one or more of our programs or are eligible to receive rewards; and (3) Suppliers, which are the third-party providers of content and services for our programs and solutions.  
Clients: 
 Our clients value our technology, platforms and services because we offer them loyalty and customer engagement programs and solutions that help strengthen and expand the value of their customer relationships. We identify the needs of our clients’ customers and create customized loyalty and customer engagement solutions and differentiated programs that promote our clients’ brands and enhance their results. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,900 clients in a variety of industries including financial services, ecommerce, retail, travel and telecommunications. Some of our leading clients, based on revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, include JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Transworld Entertainment, Trainline, Citibank and Capital One. Revenues generated from our largest client, JPMorgan Chase, and its customers, accounted for 14.8% of total net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. Many of our clients have been working with us for over ten years. 
 Customers: 
 Our customers value participation in our programs and access to our solutions because of the seamless service and relevant, best-in-class rewards we offer through our loyalty programs and the attractive lifestyle and protection services and enhanced benefits of our customer engagement programs. Depending on the nature of the relationship we have with a given client, customers may either purchase our programs directly from us or receive the benefits and solutions from our client. We derived approximately 42.5% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 from subscribers and customers we obtained through our 10 largest clients. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 44.3 million customers who received loyalty points-based management and redemption services or credit or debit card enhancement services and approximately 24.4 million subscribers and end-customers enrolled in our customer engagement programs worldwide.
 Suppliers: 
 We provide benefits and services with our in-house capabilities, but we also contract with one or more of our many third-party suppliers to provide components for our programs and solutions, such as credit reports, travel content, gift cards and merchandise. Our flexible platforms allow for real-time integration with our suppliers, and they value their relationships with us because we provide them with significant incremental revenue by bundling their content with our own and offering these solutions through proprietary and supplementary distribution channels. Generally, our relationships with key suppliers are governed by long-term contracts (typically with initial terms of up to five years that renew automatically unless notice of non-renewal is given by either party prior to renewal).

Business Segments
 We organize our business into the following three business segments: 
  
• | Global Loyalty. This segment consists of all of our loyalty assets globally in which we are a provider of end-to-end loyalty solutions that help clients reward, enrich, motivate and retain customers, including program design, points management and administration, and broad-based fulfillment and redemption across multiple channels. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Global Customer Engagement. This segment consists of our customer engagement business, in which we are a leading global solutions provider that delivers a flexible mix of benefits and services for our clients that meet customers’ needs, including products that are designed to help consumers save money and gain peace of mind. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Legacy Membership and Package. This segment consists of certain global membership and package programs that are no longer being actively marketed but continue to be serviced and supported. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Operating Segment Results” and Note 19—Segment Information in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for additional financial information about these business segments. In addition, see Note 19—Segment Information in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for additional financial information by geographic area.
 We use our proprietary technology platforms to support our business segments and deliver differentiated programs and solutions to our clients. The development and maintenance of our leading technology platforms is integral to our ability to maximize value from each of our client relationships.  
 Industry Overview
 Loyalty and customer engagement programs and solutions provide incentives and benefits to major brands to support their loyalty and customer experience objectives. Businesses use loyalty and customer engagement programs and solutions to further integrate and enrich their relationships with existing customers and to engage and attract new customers. 
 Points-based loyalty programs offer many redemption options, including gift card, travel, merchandise, cash back and various other options. We believe the market for loyalty program services is substantial and growing, and we also believe redemption volumes continue to grow. In the United States, the number of loyalty program memberships was approximately 3.8 billion in 2016, increasing by 15% since 2014, according to the 2017 Colloquy Loyalty Census report. Internationally, we believe the market for loyalty program and redemption management offers significant growth opportunities. 
 Through our global customer engagement operations, we create and manage innovative programs and solutions that address key consumer needs such as greater peace-of-mind and meaningful savings. According to the Consumer Sentinel Network Data Book, a Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) report, identity theft was the number two complaint reported to the FTC for the calendar year 2017. 
 Our Market Opportunity and Business Strategy 
 In 2016, we implemented a new globalized organizational structure to better support our key strategic initiatives and enhance long-term revenue growth. This organizational structure allowed us to combine similar lines of business on common platforms and shared infrastructures on a global basis to drive best practices and efficiencies, with meaningful cost savings. In addition, we are no longer materially investing in lines of business that we believe are not essential to our long-term growth prospects. We remain committed to our business strategy of pursuing initiatives that maintain and enhance our position as a global leader in loyalty and customer engagement solutions. The 2016 implementation of the global organizational structure marked another major step in our strategic plan and ongoing transformation into a pure-play loyalty solutions company. 
 Our strategy is to pursue initiatives that maintain and enhance our position as a global leader in the designing, administering and fulfilling of comprehensive loyalty and customer engagement solutions that strengthen and expand the value of customer relationships for our clients by creating and/or delivering valuable programs and solutions that generate incremental loyalty and to focus on attractive opportunities that will increase our profitability and cash flows. We believe there are substantial opportunities and demand for our programs and solutions, and the key elements of our strategy are to:
 Capitalize on a Large Domestic Market for our Loyalty Solutions. We believe the domestic market for loyalty program services is substantial and growing; U.S. loyalty memberships grew from 3.3 billion in 2014 to 3.8 billion in 2016, a growth rate of 15%, according to the 2017 Colloquy Loyalty Census report. We also believe redemption volumes continue to grow and new technologies such as virtual personal assistants and conversational interfaces will continue to provide incremental transaction opportunities. We also continue to identify additional distribution opportunities for rewards and incentives. We believe there are additional opportunities to expand our loyalty business as both current and prospective clients increasingly determine that a loyalty program is a meaningful way to differentiate their services in highly-competitive industries and as consumers continue to respond to these programs as a cost-effective method of acquiring travel services and other rewards. We believe we have opportunities to increase the range of administrative and redemption services we currently provide to our clients, and we intend to leverage our experience and capabilities to broaden the addressable market to include other industries where rewards programs can be used to favorably influence consumer behavior. 
 5

Leverage our Travel Platform and Content and Services. We believe that our unique blend of our travel platform and our mix of content will continue to drive incremental transaction volume.  Our travel platform embraces and enables real-time access to data critical to the enhancement of the customer experience, disruptive technologies that provide opportunities to enhance the customer experience throughout the travel lifecycle, and beacons and geo-based targeting that are critical to providing real-time rewards during the travel experience. In addition, our platform and mix of content is built to embrace new technology and services such as artificial intelligence leveraged to optimize the travel search experience, bots to facilitate real-time customer interactions, help streamline the booking process and serve a significant servicing function, and voice recognition as a significant part of the customer experience.   
 Continue to Expand the Global Footprint for our Customer Engagement Solutions. We believe that we are well positioned to provide our clients with comprehensive customer engagement programs and solutions offerings on a global basis. Our goal is to help our clients build new revenue sources and increase engagement by tailoring our programs and solutions to deliver impactful customer experiences. We are continuing to execute on our plan to extend our operations into new countries and geographic regions, including, most recently, Eastern Europe and emerging markets. We intend to continue our growth across the globe through both organic initiatives, including geographic expansion, as well as the continued evaluation of strategic acquisitions that strengthen our customer engagement programs and solutions, grow our distribution capabilities or enhance our scale. We also believe demand for incremental revenue sources by European financial institutions, e-tailers, retailers and telecom providers continues to increase.
 Capitalize on Demand for Key Customer Engagement Programs and Solutions such as Identity Theft Protection, Personalized Data Protection and Consumer Savings. We believe there are additional opportunities to grow our customer engagement business both domestically and internationally, as we provide solutions that strengthen our partners’ existing customer relationships by engaging consumers and building brand loyalty thereby generating incremental revenue for our partners.  We intend to expand and grow our existing portfolio focusing on financial institution clients, further penetrating and growing our ecommerce business, leveraging current assets and developing new capabilities, and evolve and modernize our engagement solutions offerings and platform to gain new business development traction. We believe consumers are increasingly focused on protecting their identity and credit accounts. According to the Consumer Sentinel Network Data Book, an FTC report, identity theft was the number two complaint reported to the FTC for the calendar year 2017.  In addition, consumer demand for coupons and discounts continues to grow with expanded acceptance and delivery mechanisms. 
 Optimize Our Investment. Our ability to adjust and optimize the allocation of our investment across all of our clients, technology platforms, products and geographic regions based on the available opportunities will help us continue to maximize the returns on our businesses. We target minimum returns for all of our investments, incorporating the expected revenues, transaction volume, programming and administrative fees, persistency of customer tenure, commission rates and servicing and other variable costs for those clients and customers who utilize our programs and solutions. Our goal is to enrich and enhance our clients’ customer relationship by continuing to invest in our platform and solutions, and to continue to deliver relevant and leading products and services. 
 Focus on New Program Development. We continually develop and test new programs and solutions to identify consumer trends that can be converted into revenue-enhancing and customer engagement-building opportunities. These programs and solutions may include loyalty and enhancement services, identity theft protection products and purchase warranty offerings. We also consider acquisitions of new and complementary programs and technology to further enhance our offerings and generate additional revenue. In addition, we believe we have opportunities to enhance our existing services by enabling customers to engage more effectively through digital channels. For instance, many of our programs and solutions, such as loyalty rewards redemptions, leisure and travel discounts, and identity theft protection are designed with mobile-first users in mind, delivering customer-centric user journeys and featuring real-time availability of data. 
Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe our success and competitive advantage in providing comprehensive loyalty and customer engagement solutions is due to our ability to leverage a number of key strengths, including:
 Flexible, Scalable, Custom and Secure Platforms. Our platforms provide end-to-end loyalty and customer engagement programs and solutions. Our platforms allow for a flexible mix of benefits and services to meet our clients’ needs. In addition, the scalability of our platforms allows us to continuously add new features, partners, programs and customer segments efficiently and effectively. We customize our loyalty and engagement programs and solutions to differentiate our client’s brand. Our clients’ customers’ data is protected ensuring that their program is secure and rewarding.   
 We believe our flexible, scalable, custom and secure platforms increase the value we provide to our clients, allowing for a best-in-class user experience and a competitive advantage over our peers.

Broad Capabilities for Loyalty Program Solutions. We continuously monitor technology and user experience trends, as well as redemption options available to consumers of a loyalty points program. We are able to fulfill consumers’ most preferred redemption options because of our extensive supplier network that includes direct relationships with hundreds of travel, merchandise and gift card providers, representing approximately 1,050 brands. We are also licensed as a travel agency, and based on our gross transactional sales volume, we believe that we operate one of the largest leisure travel agencies in the United States. We have the flexibility to offer our clients a full service solution or a disaggregated approach, customized to their needs. Our clients are able to leverage these capabilities to ensure that their loyalty programs are providing rewards that the consumer finds relevant and meaningful, which we believe increases the likelihood that the program will positively influence consumer behavior. 
 We believe that the range of the services we are able to provide to support our clients’ loyalty programs provides us with a sustainable advantage over competitors.
Broad Based Geographic Distribution. Because we operate in 19 countries outside of the U.S., with a significant and long-standing presence in the majority of Europe’s largest markets, including the United Kingdom, the Nordic countries, Spain, Italy, France and Germany, we are able to provide our loyalty and customer engagement solutions on a global basis to better serve our clients who may have operations and customers in multiple countries. We benefit from synergies generated across all of our operations, including the ability to leverage the knowledge and experience we gain from one country into a new territory. 
 We believe that our ability to focus our business development and marketing expenditures on opportunities which offer the highest return is a key advantage that allows us to maximize our profitability and cash flows.Diverse Distribution Channels. We believe we have a strong presence in the financial institution vertical in our Global Loyalty and Global Customer Engagement businesses. We also have a strong presence with retailers and e-commerce companies. In addition, we have a growing presence in a variety of industries and verticals, such as with travel and hospitality companies and telecommunications and gaming companies. 
 We believe that our ability to focus our business development and investment on our most profitable opportunities in the most attractive markets, channels and industries, domestically and internationally, is a key advantage that allows us to maximize our profitability and cash flows.    
 Proprietary Technology and Data Analytics Capabilities. Based on the length of our operating history, we believe our technology and database of actual customer interactions is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry and cannot be replicated. Our technology platform supports subscriber management and points accounting functions and delivers a customer-centric experience for subscriber rewards accounts. We utilize our data analytics to develop highly targeted, customized loyalty and engagement programs and solutions across multiple channels and product offerings for each client with the goal of strengthening their customer relationships and more precisely identifying types of customers likely to find our programs and solutions of value. We are also able to utilize our predictive data analytics to anticipate shifts in the marketplace. 
 We believe our proprietary technology and data analytics capabilities enhance the profitability of our capital expenditures, allow us to better engage with customers, and help us to continue to secure and maintain long-term relationships with clients. 
 Strong, Long-Term Relationships with Clients. We have a long history of providing comprehensive loyalty and customer engagement solutions to leading companies in the U.S. and Europe. Because our services have broad-based consumer appeal and are relevant to any industry looking to enhance and extend the quality of their relationship across large-scale populations, our clients span a wide variety of industries, such as financial services, retail, e-commerce, travel, hospitality, and telecommunications, among others. 
 We believe that the strength and breadth of our relationships with our clients provide us with a competitive advantage in maintaining stable, diversified and predictable sources of revenue.
 Committed and Experienced Management Team. We believe that our senior management and our talented and experienced professionals are a principal reason why we have achieved significant success in all of our businesses. Led by our Chief Executive Officer, Todd Siegel, who has been with us for over nineteen years, our six senior executives have a combined 98 years of experience with Affinion Holdings. 
 We believe that the extensive experience and financial acumen of our management and marketing professionals provide us with a significant competitive advantage.

Programs and Solutions
 Global Loyalty Solutions. We create and manage any and all aspects of our clients’ loyalty programs including program design, program management, technology platform, data analytics, points administration and rewards fulfillment. We manage loyalty solutions for points-based loyalty programs for many large financial institutions and other significant businesses. We provide our clients with solutions that meet the most popular redemption options desired by their program points holders, including travel, gift cards and merchandise, and, in 2018, we facilitated approximately $3.3 billion in redemption volume. Our loyalty programs are private-label, customizable, full-service rewards solutions that consist of a variety of configurations that are offered on a stand-alone and/or bundled basis depending on customer requirements.
 We provide and manage reward products for loyalty programs through Connexions Loyalty, Inc. (“Connexions”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, which is a service provider for points-based loyalty programs such as Capital One’s Venture Card and Citibank’s ThankYou Rewards. We believe we are a leader in online and offline reward fulfillment as we fulfilled approximately 13.8 million redemptions in 2018 on an annualized basis. We do not retain any loyalty points-related liabilities. We typically charge a per-subscriber and/or a per-activity administrative fee to clients for our services. Connexions also provides clients with the ability to offer leisure travel as a subscriber benefit in a purchase environment, and a travel gift card, which can be used on all travel components, including airfare, rental car, hotel stays and cruise vacations.
 We believe we are differentiated by our technology platform that supports member management and points accounting functions and delivers a best-in-class user experience for member rewards accounts.   Our flexibility allows us to vary the rules and offerings in programs to maximize per customer revenues and profits.  Our scalability allows us to continually add new features, partners, programs, and customer segments quickly, easily and securely.  Our business rules allow each of our clients to segment their customer base with unique design and experience, seamlessly with the client’s brand.  Our clients’ customers’ data is protected, meaning their loyalty program is rewarding and secure. 
 Global Customer Engagement Solutions. Through our global customer engagement operations, we create and manage innovative programs and solutions that address key consumer needs such as greater peace-of-mind and meaningful savings. We provide our solutions to leading companies in the financial institution, telecommunications, retail and travel sectors globally. These programs and solutions help our clients enrich their offerings to drive deeper connections, and encourage their customers to engage more, stay loyal and generate more value. For example, our solutions offer customers benefits and value-added services in the growing market of credit monitoring and identity-theft resolution services, which are intended to improve the subscriber’s sense of security and well-being, or discounts on many brand categories along with shop-at-home convenience in such areas as retail merchandise travel, automotive and home improvement.
 Our customer engagement solutions may be categorized in two ways: (1) revenue enhancement, which is a traditional subscription-based model, and (2) engagement solutions, which is a fee-for-service or transactional based model. 
 In the revenue enhancement model, we provide incremental services for our clients to monetize their customer base. We also partner with clients to customize benefits that resonate with their brand and their customers’ needs. 
 In the engagement solutions model, we help clients differentiate their products and build strong customer relations. We also bundle appropriate rewards and benefits along the lifecycle of clients’ customers to create intimate, reciprocal connections that drive purchase decisions, interaction and participation over time.
 Our principal customer engagement benefits are: (1) DataPal, a combination of benefits that secures users’ internet connection, simplifies password and document storage and scans the web for personal data; (2) PrivacyGuard and My Credit Tracker, which provides access to and monitoring of credit report, credit score and credit history to prevent identity-theft; (3) Complete Savings, which provides online shopping and access to discounts; (4) Enjoymore, a shopping program offering access to discounts on dining and cinema, and cash back on tickets and other events; and (5) Great Fun, a discount program offering everyday savings on dining, shopping, and admission to individual and family-oriented entertainment.
 Clients 
 We are able to provide our loyalty and customer engagement solutions by utilizing the brand names and customer contacts of our clients. Our diversified base of clients includes approximately 2,900 companies in a wide variety of industries, including financial services, retail, travel, telecommunications, utilities and internet. Select clients include JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Transworld Entertainment, Trainline, Citibank and Capital One. In 2018, we derived approximately 42.5% of our net revenues from subscribers and end-customers obtained through our 10 largest clients.

With respect to our loyalty and engagement solutions operations, many of our principal partner agreements have a term of at least two years, which automatically renew for one-year periods and may be terminated at any time upon at least 90 days’ written notice, and we typically charge a per-subscriber and/or a per-activity administrative fee to clients for our services. Typically, our agreements with our clients for the marketing and servicing of our retail subscriber products are for fixed terms (typically one to three years, in the case of customer engagement), which automatically renew for one-year periods and may be terminated at any time upon at least 90 days’ written notice. Our clients are not subject to minimum marketing commitments that are material, individually or in the aggregate. While we generally do not have continued marketing rights following the termination of any marketing agreements, the vast majority of our marketing agreements allow us to extend or renew existing subscribers and bill and collect associated subscription fees following any termination. While we usually do not have rights to use marketing partner branding in new marketing following termination of a marketing agreement, the products we provide to subscribers are either our standard products, which do not require our marketing partner’s branding, or are co-branded products for which we typically have the ability to continue to service as co-branded products. Generally, our clients agree not to solicit our subscribers for substantially similar services both during the term of our agreement and following any termination thereof. 
 Global Loyalty. We had 40 clients at December 31, 2018, which include leading financial institutions, gaming companies, brokerage houses, automotive companies, premier hotels and travel-related companies. 
 Global Customer Engagement. We had approximately 800 clients in multiple industries at December 31, 2018. Our relationships with our largest partners typically encompass multiple products and/or types of marketing channels. In general, we have long-standing relationships with our partners. Our international clients include some of Europe’s most prominent retail banks and telecommunications companies.
Customers
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 24.4 million subscribers and end-customers enrolled in our customer engagement programs worldwide and approximately 44.3 million customers who received credit or debit card enhancement services and loyalty points-based management services. We offer our programs and solutions to our customers through approximately 2,900 clients as of December 31, 2018. We market to customers using direct mail, online marketing, point-of-sale marketing, telemarketing and other marketing methods. 
 Global Loyalty. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 44.3 million customers who received loyalty points-based management and redemption services or credit or debit card enhancement services. 
 Global Customer Engagement. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1.2 million subscribers and end-customers in the U.S. We target customers of our clients who are willing to pay a fee to gain access to a multitude of discount programs or want to improve their sense of security and well-being. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 17.4 million international package customers and approximately 2 million customers in 19 countries, primarily in Europe.
Third Party Suppliers
 We partner with a large number of third-party suppliers to provide fulfillment of many of our programs and solutions. Generally, our relationships with key suppliers are governed by long-term contracts (typically, with initial terms of up to five years that renew automatically unless notice of non-renewal is given by either party prior to renewal). As we have a large number of suppliers, we are generally not dependent on any one vendor and have alternative suppliers should we need to replace an existing vendor. We believe we have very good relationships with our suppliers who value their relationship with us as we are able to provide them with access to a large customer base through our clients, many of whom are leaders in their respective industries. In addition, because we purchase large volumes of services across our various businesses, we are able to achieve significant price discounts from our suppliers. 
 Global Loyalty. Connexions acts as a business process outsourcer for points-based loyalty products and provides enhancement benefits to credit and debit card issuers. While many of the services Connexions provides are sourced in-house as a result of Connexions’ proprietary technology platform and program design support, third-party suppliers are used to provide additional benefit enhancements. These benefit enhancements are supplied by our loyalty benefits suppliers. We work directly with approximately 500 suppliers to obtain rewards and provide loyalty clients with access to more than 8,200 available merchandise models. 
 Global Customer Engagement. We partner with a variety of third-party suppliers to provide services, benefits and fulfillment for many of our programs. Some of our largest vendor relationships relate to the provisions of certain benefits embedded in our PrivacyGuard® product and AutoVantage product. Global Customer Engagement services its clients using a variety of third-party suppliers to provide benefits, fulfillment and delivery for some of our programs. In addition, we also have key supplier relationships with third parties for benefits related to sports and entertainment events as well as the provision of certain benefits embedded in our identity theft protection products. Global Customer Engagement also uses third-party suppliers for its print and fulfillment products.

Our Technology Platform and Operations 
 We deliver tailored programs and solutions through our platform of proprietary technology, end-to-end customer service and benefits catalogue. Technology development and product development is integral to our ability to maximize value from each of our client relationships. In developing our programs and solutions, we focus on leveraging marketplace trends and increasing loyalty, with a critical focus on the needs of the consumer. We continue to make significant product development investments to ensure that our proprietary technology meets industry leadership standards and can be seamlessly integrated and customized to further support our clients’ brands and loyalty strategy. 
 When we enhance existing and/or develop new programs and solutions, we take into account not only the combination of benefits that will make up the program or solution, but the characteristics of the customers to whom we will target.  
 We also research, build and launch custom partner programs and solutions that we create uniquely for clients to address specific needs of these clients and their customers.
 Proprietary Technology. Our proprietary technology allows our clients to integrate and enrich relationships with their customers, supporting our value proposition in the marketplace. We focus on utilizing our proprietary technology to deliver programs and solutions that motivate and inspire loyalty by consumers. 
 We continue to make investments to maintain and update our proprietary technology to remain competitive in the marketplace. Our technology platform is also built to embrace new technologies and innovation such as artificial intelligence and voice recognition used to enhance the customer experience.   
 End-to-End Customer Service. We provide full customer service support and delivery globally, including enrollment, benefits support, fulfillment, billing and payment. We focus on integrating and optimizing the customer journey through our end-to-end customer service.
 Servicing and enrollment requests are processed through a workflow and messaging interface with our suppliers and are stored within our subscriber management platform. This framework allows us to keep a virtual inventory of programs and solutions, as well as store customer information for future investment analysis. Customer servicing and billing information is fed into the financial ledger and business intelligence platform for billing and future investment analysis. 
 Benefits Catalogue. We believe that our ability to customize programs and solutions utilizing a broad range of benefits that we provide enables us to meet the complex and highly specialized customer engagement needs of our clients and their customers. Our benefits catalogue may be categorized generally as addressing one of two broad categories of fundamental consumer needs: (1) protection and peace-of-mind services or (2) savings on lifestyle-oriented purchases and loyalty solutions.
 Our loyalty programs offer many redemption options, including gift card, travel, merchandise, cash back and various other options. Our customer engagement programs and solutions offer benefits including credit monitoring, access to credit reports, online data monitoring, online shopping and access to savings such as dining discounts, cinema discounts and cash back on tickets and other events, and concierge services. 
 Processing
 The processing responsibilities of the operations group can be divided into: (1) travel fulfillment; (2) gift card fulfillment; (3) merchandise fulfillment; (4) enrollments; (5) fulfillment packages; and (6) billing. 
 Travel Fulfillment. Loyalty Travel Agency LLC, our full-service travel agency, is dedicated primarily to servicing our customers; however, it also provides travel agency services to our clients, mainly for loyalty rewards redemptions and related services.
 Gift Card Fulfillment. Through an in-house gift card fulfillment facility, we deliver approximately 7.5 million gift card rewards annually, and we have approximately 200 merchant relationships directly sourced and managed.
 Merchandise Fulfillment. We provide merchandise rewards fulfillment to our clients’ customers with access to approximately 10,700 products from over 750 top brands. We manage the process of customers purchasing merchandise products, but we outsource delivery logistics to back-end suppliers. While we manage the fulfillment process, we generally do not take ownership or physical possession of any of the products being delivered.
 Enrollments. Enrollment information is sent to us through a variety of different media, including mail, electronic file transfer from clients and telemarketing vendors and the internet. Average turnaround time from receipt to enrollment is approximately 24 hours. 
 10

Fulfillment Packages. Fulfillment packages, which include enrollment materials and premiums (e.g., coupons and “hard” premiums) sent to customers via mail and electronically, are produced in thousands of combinations for our global customer engagement programs. Fulfillment orders are generally transmitted to the appropriate fulfillment supplier by the next business day following receipt of the order. 
 Billing. We have the ability to accept a variety of different payment account types, including Visa (debit and credit), MasterCard (debit and credit), Discover, American Express, retail company proprietary cards, PayPal, and checking and savings accounts. We use both generic and direct processing methods and work closely with a variety of payment processors and our clients to maximize our ultimate collection rates. 
Competition
 We are a leading loyalty and customer engagement solutions company with value-added programs and services with a network of approximately 2,900 clients as of December 31, 2018, approximately 24.4 million subscribers and end-customers enrolled in our customer engagement programs worldwide and approximately 44.3 million customers who received credit or debit card enhancement services and loyalty points-based management and redemption services as of December 31, 2018. Our leadership position in the marketing and loyalty points program management industries is due to our nearly 40-year track record and our core strengths in the areas of multi-channels marketing, data analytics, customer service and operations. We also believe our portfolio of programs and benefits is the broadest in the industry, and that we are capable of providing the full range of administrative services for loyalty points programs. At December 31, 2018, we offered 13 core products and services with over 210 unique benefits and supported more than 4,100 versions of products and services representing different combinations of pricing, benefit configurations and branding. 
 Our competitors include any company seeking direct and regular access to large groups of customers through any direct marketing channel, as well as any company capable of managing loyalty points programs or providing redemption options for those programs. Our products and services compete with those marketed by financial institutions and other third parties who have marketing relationships with our competition, including large, fully integrated companies that have financial, marketing and product development resources that are greater than ours. We face competition in all areas of our business, including price, product offerings and product performance. As a whole, the direct marketing services industry is extremely fragmented, while competition in loyalty points program administration is somewhat more concentrated. Most companies in the direct marketing services industry are relatively small and provide a limited array of products and services. In general, competition for the consumer’s attention is intense, with a wide variety of players competing in different segments of the direct marketing industry. More specifically, competition within our business lines comes from companies that vary significantly in size, scope and primary core competencies. 
 Global Loyalty Solutions. Participants in the loyalty arena provide in-house rewards programs and utilize third-party providers. Such third-party providers design, market and manage rewards-based loyalty programs for businesses that either have no desire to manage such programs or lack the core competencies necessary to compete in the industry effectively. Key industry participants include Maritz Loyalty Marketing, Blackhawk, Expedia, Bridge2Solutions and Epsilon. 
 Customer Engagement Solutions. The customer engagement solutions industry is characterized by a high degree of competition. Participants in this industry include engagement services companies, such as AAA, LifeLock and Intersections, as well as the credit bureaus, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, and large retailers, travel agencies, insurance companies and financial service institutions. Internationally, on the customer engagement side of the business, competitors include Card Protection Plan, LV8, Plebicom S.A., as well as large retailers, travel agencies, insurance companies and financial service institutions. Key competitors in the package business include Card Protection Plan, MobileServ Limited, and Lifestyle Service Group in the United Kingdom, Serisystem and Jakala in Italy, MehrWert Servicegesellschaft in Germany and Falck in Norway.

Company History
 We have over 40 years of operational history. We started offering membership products in 1973, and in 1985 began marketing insurance and package enhancement products. In 1988, we entered the loyalty solutions business and in the early 1990s, we started offering certain of our program offerings internationally. 
 In 2005, the Company was acquired by investment funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC (such investment funds, the “Apollo Funds”) from Cendant Corporation (“Cendant”) through the consummation of the Apollo Transactions (as defined in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—The Apollo Transactions”). 
 In 2011, we entered into a merger agreement that resulted in Affinion Holdings’ indirect acquisition of all of the capital stock of Webloyalty Holdings, Inc. (“Webloyalty”) and the conversion of Webloyalty securities into Affinion Holdings securities (the “Webloyalty Acquisition”) and the acquisition of approximately 21% of the common stock of Affinion Holdings by investment funds affiliated with General Atlantic LLC (such investment funds referred to as “General Atlantic”) with the Apollo Funds continuing to own approximately 70% of the common stock of Affinion Holdings.

 Upon consummation of the 2015 Exchange Offers, the Apollo Funds and General Atlantic ceased to have beneficial ownership of any common stock of Affinion Holdings. See “Item 12.

On August 15, 2018, the Seller completed the ABG Sale pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.
 On April 10, 2019, we consummated the 2019 Recapitalization, as defined and described below under “Item 7.

 Governmental and Regulatory Matters
 Our business is subject to U.S. federal and state regulation as well as regulation by governments and authorities in foreign jurisdictions. Certain regulations that govern our operations include: federal, state and foreign marketing laws; federal, state and foreign privacy laws; and federal, state and foreign insurance and consumer protection regulations. Federal regulations are primarily enforced by the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). State regulations are primarily enforced by individual state attorneys general. Foreign regulations are enforced by a number of regulatory bodies in the relevant jurisdictions. 
 Federal and State Marketing Laws. The FTC, CFPB and each of the states have enacted consumer protection statutes designed to ensure that consumers are protected from unfair, deceptive and abusive marketing practices. We review all of our marketing materials for compliance with applicable federal and state regulations and state marketing laws. 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) mandates the most wide-ranging overhaul of financial industry regulation in decades. Dodd-Frank was signed into law on July 21, 2010. Dodd-Frank created the CFPB that became operational on July 21, 2011 and has the authority to regulate all consumer financial products sold by banks and non-bank companies.

Billing Regulations. In 1978, Regulation E was issued by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors to implement the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (the “EFT”). The EFT provides for rights and duties of consumers and financial institutions in connection with debit or credit “electronic fund transfers”- transfers to or from demand, savings, or other deposit accounts initiated through computer or magnetic tape, telephones, point-of-sale terminals, ATMs, or any other electronic device. It includes all transfers resulting from debit card transfers, whether or not they involve an electronic terminal. We have implemented billing solutions across our businesses to comply with the EFT. 
 Additionally, in connection with the sale of its products and services, the Company permits customers to make payment by means of automated clearing house (“ACH”) funds transfers from bank accounts, direct bank account debits, credit cards and debit cards. The Company accepts authorizations for these customer payments by means of the telephone, the internet and postal mail. In connection with its payment acceptance activities, the Company is subject to the operating rules and procedures of the card associations and card networks (including Visa and MasterCard) and the payment rules governing ACH payments and electronic funds transfers. The Company is also subject to federal and state laws that impose certain requirements on merchants when accepting payments, including recurring payments, from customers. These payment system rules and laws are subject to amendment and new interpretations from time to time which may impose new costs on the Company’s operations and materially impact the services we provide. The Company has adopted policies and procedures across our businesses to comply with these payment system rules and laws. 
 Federal Privacy Laws. The Financial Modernization Act of 1999, also known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLB”), includes provisions to protect consumers’ personal financial information held by financial institutions. GLB places restrictions on the ability of financial institutions to disclose non-public personal information about their customers to non-affiliated third parties and also prohibits financial institutions from disclosing account numbers to any non-affiliated third parties for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. We have implemented privacy solutions across our businesses designed to comply with GLB. 
 Additionally, several bills have been proposed in Congress that could restrict the collection and dissemination of personal information for marketing purposes. If any such legislation is passed, we would implement appropriate procedures and practices to comply with such laws. 
 State Privacy Laws. In addition to federal legislation, some states are considering or have passed laws restricting the sharing of customer information. For example, the California Financial Information Privacy Act (“SB-1”) places restrictions on financial institutions’ ability to share the personal information of their California customers. We have established a privacy solution that is designed to comply with the requirements of SB-1. 
 Other Foreign Regulations. Our European operations are subject to privacy and consumer protection regulations. Many of these regulations are based on EU Directives which are adopted as laws by countries within the EU in which Affinion International conducts its operations. These include: 

• | General Data Protection regulation: imposing security obligations, consent requirements, and restrictions on the processing, use and transmission of customers’ personal data;

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Consumer Rights Directive: harmonizing certain consumer rights across Europe, including requiring that consumers receive certain pre-contract information, clarifying cancellation rights for distance and off-premises contracts and digital products contracts, and prohibiting excessive surcharges on payment cards and telephone lines.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, there are various self-regulatory codes of advertising and direct marketing practice. We have established procedures designed to comply with the requirements of these codes and practices. Further, the FCA and other international regulators and competent authorities may change or introduce new laws or regulations that materially impact the membership, package enhancement and other services we provide.
