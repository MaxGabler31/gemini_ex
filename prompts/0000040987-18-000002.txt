to its heavy vehicle parts operations with the June 2017 acquisition of Stone Truck Parts, headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina. 
The GPC Asia Pacific automotive business expanded its distribution network in Australia with the addition of three single-location businesses, including Welch Auto Parts in July 2017, Logan City Autobarn in August of 2017, subsequently re-branded as a NAPA Auto Super Store, and Sulco Tools and Equipment in September of 2017. Finally, the NAPA Canada/UAP business enhanced its auto parts and heavy vehicle distribution network with the addition of three new businesses.

Further, effective November 2, 2017, the Company acquired Alliance Automotive Group ("AAG") for approximately $2.0 billion, including the repayment of AAG's outstanding debt. The purchase was funded primarily through new debt agreements. AAG is the second largest parts distributor in Europe, with a focus on light vehicle and commercial vehicle replacement parts. Headquartered in London, England, AAG has annual revenues of approximately $1.7 billion and over 2,000 company-owned stores and affiliated outlets across France, the U.K., Germany and Poland. 
The Company has a 15% interest in Mitchell Repair Information Corporation (“MRIC”), a subsidiary of Snap-on Incorporated. MRIC is a leading automotive diagnostic and repair information company that links North American subscribers to its services and information databases. MRIC’s core product, “Mitchell ON-DEMAND,” is a premier electronic repair information source in the automotive aftermarket.
The Company’s NAPA automotive parts distribution centers distribute replacement parts (other than body parts) for substantially all motor vehicle makes and models in service in the United States, including imported vehicles, trucks, SUVs, buses, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and farm vehicles. In addition, the Company distributes replacement parts for small engines, farm equipment and heavy duty equipment. The Company’s inventories also include accessory items for such vehicles and equipment, and supply items used by a wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket, such as repair shops, service stations, fleet operators, automobile and truck dealers, leasing companies, bus and truck lines, mass merchandisers, farms, industrial concerns and individuals who perform their own maintenance and parts installation. Although the Company’s domestic automotive operations purchase from approximately 100 different suppliers, approximately 48% of 2017 automotive parts inventories were purchased from 10 major suppliers. Since 1931, the Company has had return privileges with most of its suppliers, which have protected the Company from inventory obsolescence.
Distribution System.    In 2017, the Company operated 57 domestic NAPA automotive parts distribution centers located in 41 states and approximately 1,100 domestic company-owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located in 45 states. The Company also operated domestically three TW Distribution heavy duty parts distribution centers which serve 20 company-owned and seven independently owned Traction Heavy Duty parts stores located in eight states. The Traction operations are discussed further below in Related Operations. At December 31, 2017, the Company had either a noncontrolling, controlling or other interest in 12 corporations, which operated approximately 200 auto parts stores in 14 states.
The Company’s domestic distribution centers serve approximately 4,800 independently owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located throughout the United States. NAPA AUTO PARTS stores, in turn, sell to a wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket. Collectively, sales to these independent automotive parts stores account for approximately 59% of the Company’s total U.S. Automotive sales and 22% of the Company’s total sales, with no automotive parts store or group of automotive parts stores with individual or common ownership accounting for more than 0.79% of the total U.S. auto sales and 0.29% of the total sales of the Company.

Significant inventories are carried to provide for fast and frequent deliveries to customers. Most orders are filled and shipped the same day they are received. The majority of sales are paid from statements with varied terms and conditions. The Company does not manufacture any of the products it distributes. The majority of products are distributed under the NAPA® name, a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA, which is important to the sales and marketing of these products. Traction sales also include products distributed under the HD Plus name, a proprietary line of automotive parts for the heavy duty truck market.
Related Operations.    Balkamp, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, distributes a wide variety of replacement parts and accessory items for passenger cars, heavy-duty vehicles, motorcycles and farm equipment.

The Company’s Heavy Vehicle Parts Group operates as TW Distribution, with three heavy vehicle automotive parts distribution centers and 27 Traction Heavy Duty parts stores in the United States. Twenty of these stores are company-owned and seven are independently owned. This group, which expanded its U.S. footprint with the acquisition of Stone Truck Parts in 2017 (discussed earlier) distributes heavy vehicle parts through the NAPA system and direct to small and large fleet owners and operators.
Segment Data.    In the year ended December 31, 2017, sales from the Automotive Parts Group were approximately 53% of the Company’s net sales, as compared to 53% in 2016 and 52% in 2015. For additional segment information, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1.
Service to NAPA AUTO PARTS Stores.    The Company believes that the quality and the range of services provided to its automotive parts customers constitute a significant advantage for its automotive parts distribution system. Such services include fast and frequent delivery, parts cataloging (including the use of electronic NAPA AUTO PARTS catalogs) and stock adjustment through a continuing parts classification system which, as initiated by the Company from time to time, allows independent retailers (“jobbers”) to return certain merchandise on a scheduled basis. The Company offers its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers various management aids, marketing aids and service on topics such as inventory control, cost analysis, accounting procedures, group insurance and retirement benefit plans, as well as marketing conferences and seminars, sales and advertising manuals and training programs. Point of sale/inventory management is available through TAMS® (Total Automotive Management Systems), a computer system designed and developed by the Company for the NAPA AUTO PARTS stores.
The Company has developed and refined an inventory classification system to determine optimum distribution center and auto parts store inventory levels for automotive parts stocking based on automotive registrations, usage rates, production statistics, technological advances and other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous analytical review, is an integral part of the Company’s inventory control procedures and comprises an important feature of the inventory management

services that the Company makes available to its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers. Over the last 25 years, losses to the Company from obsolescence have been insignificant and the Company attributes this to the successful operation of its classification system, which involves product return privileges with most of its suppliers.
Competition.    The automotive parts distribution business is highly competitive. The Company competes with automobile manufacturers (some of which sell replacement parts for vehicles built by other manufacturers as well as those that they build themselves), automobile dealers, warehouse clubs and large automotive parts retail chains. In addition, the Company competes with the distributing outlets of parts manufacturers, oil companies, mass merchandisers (including national retail chains), and with other parts distributors and retailers, including online retailers. The Automotive Parts Group competes primarily on product offering, service, brand recognition and price. Further information regarding competition in the industry is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We Face Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do Business.”
NAPA.    The Company is the sole member of the National Automotive Parts Association, a voluntary association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of automotive parts. NAPA, which neither buys nor sells automotive parts, functions as a trade association whose sole member in 2017 owned and operated 57 distribution centers located throughout the United States. NAPA develops marketing concepts and programs that may be used by its members which, at December 31, 2017, includes only the Company. It is not involved in the chain of distribution.
Among the automotive products purchased by the Company from various manufacturers for distribution are certain lines designated, cataloged, advertised and promoted as “NAPA” lines. Generally, the Company is not required to purchase any specific quantity of parts so designated and it may, and does, purchase competitive lines from the same as well as other supply sources.
The Company uses the federally registered trademark NAPA® as part of the trade name of its distribution centers and parts stores. The Company funds NAPA’s national advertising program, which is designed to increase public recognition of the NAPA name and to promote NAPA product lines.
The Company is a party, together with the former members of NAPA, to a consent decree entered by the Federal District Court in Detroit, Michigan, on May 4, 1954. The consent decree enjoins certain practices under the federal antitrust laws, including the use of exclusive agreements with manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of territories among the Company and former NAPA members, fixing of prices or terms of sale for such parts among such members, and agreements to adhere to any uniform policy in selecting parts customers or determining the number and location of, or arrangements with, auto parts customers.

Inenco, headquartered in Sydney, Australia, is a leading distributor of industrial replacements parts and accessories in Australasia, with annual revenues of approximately $325 million and operating in 161 locations across Australia, New Zealand, and Asia. In accordance with the purchase agreement, the Company has an option to acquire the remaining 65% interest in Inenco at a later date, contingent upon Inenco meeting certain financial conditions. In 2017, the Company accounted for this investment under the equity method of accounting. 
Effective August 1, 2017, Motion acquired Numatic Engineering ("Numatic"), a Los Angeles, California based distributor of automation products. Numatic complements Motion's growth strategy, which included the acquisition of Braas Company in 2016, of focusing on the area of industrial plant floor automation. Numatic is expected to generate approximately $18 million in annual revenues. Additionally, Motion acquired Apache Hose & Belting Company, Inc. ("Apache") on November 1, 2017.

added fabrication of belts, hoses and other industrial products. Apache is expected to generate approximately $100 million in annual revenues.
The Industrial Parts Group provides customers with supply chain efficiencies achieved through the Company’s On-Site Solutions offering. This service provides inventory management, asset repair and tracking, vendor managed inventory commonly referred to as VMI, as well as RFID asset management of the customer’s inventory. Motion’s Energy Services Team routinely performs in-plant surveys and assessments, helping customers reduce their energy consumption and finding opportunities for improved sustainability, ultimately helping customers operate more profitably. Motion also provides a wide range of services and repairs such as: gearbox and fluid power assembly repair, process pump assembly and repair, hydraulic drive shaft repair, electrical panel assembly and repair, hose and gasket manufacture and assembly, as well as many other value-added services. A highly developed supply chain with vendor partnerships and connectivity are enhanced by Motion’s leading e-business capabilities, such as MiSupplierConnect, which provides integration between the Company’s information technology network and suppliers’ systems, creating numerous benefits for both the supplier and customer. These services and supply chain efficiencies assist Motion in providing the cost savings that many of its customers require and expect.
Distribution System.    In North America, the Industrial Parts Group operated 498 branches, 14 distribution centers and 43 service centers as of December 31, 2017. The distribution centers stock and distribute more than 275,000 different items purchased from more than 1,050 different suppliers. The service centers provide hydraulic, hose and mechanical repairs for customers. Approximately 45% of total industrial product purchases in 2017 were made from 10 major suppliers. Sales are generated from the Industrial Parts Group’s branches located in 49 states, Puerto Rico, nine provinces in Canada, and Mexico. Most branches have warehouse facilities that stock significant amounts of inventory representative of the products used by customers in the respective market area served.
Products.    The Industrial Parts Group distributes a wide variety of parts and products to its customers, which are primarily industrial concerns. Products include such items as hoses, belts, bearings, pulleys, pumps, valves, chains, gears, sprockets, speed reducers, electric motors, and industrial supplies. In recent years, Motion expanded its offering to include systems and automation products in response to the increasing sophistication of motion control and process automation for full systems integration of plant equipment. Manufacturing trends and government policies have led to opportunities in the “green” and energy-efficient product markets, focusing on product offerings such as energy-efficient motors and drives, recyclable and environmentally friendly parts and supplies. The nature of this group’s business demands the maintenance of adequate inventories and the ability to promptly meet demanding delivery requirements. Virtually all of the products distributed are installed by the customer or used in plant and facility maintenance activities. Most orders are filled immediately from existing stock and deliveries are normally made within 24 hours of receipt of order. The majority of all sales are on open account. Motion has ongoing purchase agreements with existing customers that represent approximately 50% of the annual sales volume.
Supply Agreements.    Non-exclusive distributor agreements are in effect with most of the Industrial Parts Group’s suppliers. The terms of these agreements vary; however, it has been the experience of the Industrial Parts Group that the custom of the trade is to treat such agreements as continuing until breached by one party or until terminated by mutual consent. Motion has return privileges with most of its suppliers, which helps protect the Company from inventory obsolescence.
Segment Data.    In the year ended December 31, 2017, sales from the Company’s Industrial Parts Group approximated 30% of the Company’s net sales, as compared to 30% in 2016 and 2015. For additional segment information, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1.
Competition.    The industrial parts distribution business is highly competitive. The Industrial Parts Group competes with other distributors specializing in the distribution of such items, general line distributors and others who provide similar services. To a lesser extent, the Industrial Parts Group competes with manufacturers that sell directly to the customer. The Industrial Parts Group competes primarily on the breadth of product offerings, service and price. Further information regarding competition in the industry is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We Face Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do Business.”
