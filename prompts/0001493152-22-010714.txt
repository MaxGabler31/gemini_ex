General
 
The Company owns and operates a portfolio of companies with a concentration in the industrial, and recreational diving industry. The Company, through its subsidiaries, designs, tests, manufactures, and distributes recreational hookah diving, yacht-based scuba air compressors and nitrox generation systems, and scuba and water safety products in the United States and internationally.
 
The Company has four subsidiaries focused on various sub-sectors of our industry:
 

● | Brownie’s Third Lung | Surface Supplied Air (“SSA”) 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | BLU3, Inc. | Ultra-Portable Tankless Dive Systems 
● | LW Americas | High Pressure Gas Systems 
● | Submersible Systems, Inc. | Redundant Air Tank Systems 

 
Our wholly owned subsidiaries do business under their respective trade names on both a wholesale and retail basis from our headquarters and manufacturing facility in Pompano Beach, Florida, and a manufacturing facility in Huntington Beach, California.
 
The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, designs, tests, and manufactures tankless dive systems, rescue air systems and yacht-based self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (“SCUBA”) air compressor and nitrox generation fill systems and acts as the exclusive distributor for North and South America for Lenhardt & Wagner GmbH (“L&W”) compressors in the high-pressure breathing air and industrial gas markets. The Company is also the exclusive United States and Caribbean distributor for Chrysalis Trading CC, a South African manufacturer of fitness and dive equipment, doing business as Bright Weights (“Bright Weights”), of a dive ballast system produced in South Africa. Our wholly owned subsidiaries and related product lines are as follows:
 

Surface Supplied Air Products
 
Our Brownie’s Third Lung systems have been a dominant figure in gasoline powered, high-performance, and more recently in the battery powered SSA diving systems. Taking full advantage of the proprietary compressor system, a complete series of traditional “fixed speed” electric compressors were developed for the built-in-boat market in 2005. In 2010, we introduced our variable-speed battery powered hookah system which provides divers with gasoline-free all day shallow diving experiences. These systems provide performance and runtimes for up to 3 hours by utilizing a variable speed technology that controls battery consumption based on diver demand.
 
In 2021 we continued to expand our dealer network and our marketing efforts with both the consumer and our network of dealers. The Company continues to pursue dealers outside of the United States in order to diversify the seasonality as well as the geography risks. Additionally, we continue to pursue more aggressively the boat builder market to offer our SSA systems as an option on newly built boats, expanding our market beyond the traditional consumer markets for our products.
 
Our SSA products include:
 
● Tankless Dive Systems: The Company produces a line of tankless dive products, commonly called hookah or recreational SSA systems. These systems allow one to four divers to enjoy the marine environment up to a depth of 45 feet without the bulk and weight of conventional SCUBA gear. We believe that the removal of barriers to entry into the sport of diving and the reduction of complicated and bulky SCUBA gear invites a broader range of the general public to participate more actively and enjoyably at their own pace and schedule. Our product is designed to reduces the effort required for its transport and use while exploring, cruising or traveling.
 
A line of land-based systems is available for light-duty commercial applications that demand portability and performance. In addition to the gasoline-powered units and the variable speed battery powered units, a series of AC electric powered systems is also available for light to commercial use. Powered by battery for portability or household current for unlimited dive duration, these units are used primarily by businesses that work in aquatic maintenance and marine environments.
 
● BIAS (Boat Integrated Air Systems): The Company developed several tankless products and complimentary accessories that it believes makes boat diving easier. The BIAS battery powered tankless kit allows boat builders, dealers and end users to seamlessly install a pre-packaged kit directly into the boat and our E-Reel, a level-winding battery powered hose reel system, provides compact storage of up to 150 feet of hose. Boaters can perform their own in-water maintenance and inspections, or just dive for enjoyment. In addition to supplying air to divers, BIAS may be used for supporting air horns, inflating boat fenders/water toys and activating pneumatically operated doors.

Ultra Portable Tankless Dive Systems
 
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary BLU3, we develop and market a next generation electric, surface supplied air shallow dive system that is completely portable to the user. The BLU3 line currently consists of two models, NEMO and NOMAD, targeting specific performance levels and price points.
 
NEMO dive systems are currently sold in 9 countries through Amazon, and also through 54 dealers worldwide. NEMO, designed to be the world’s smallest dive system is capable of taking a diver to 10 feet for 60 to 90 minutes on one charge of its lithium-ion battery. NEMO is portable and its batteries are FAA compliant for airline travel.
 
NOMAD dive system (“NOMAD”) began shipping in the third quarter, 2021 and is currently sold to consumers via our website, Amazon and through our network of dealers worldwide. The NOMAD is highly portable and expands dive capability to up to 30 feet. NOMAD has been marketed through BLU3’s internet presence and marketing campaigns as well as at industry and other trade shows across the country.
 
We believe the BLU3 product lines are changing the way that people get into the water and explore the next atmosphere. The units are ultra-portable and can travel with the consumer to their adventures, wherever they may be.
 

High Pressure Gas Systems
 
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary LW America’s, we design, manufacture, sell and install SCUBA tank fill systems for on-board yacht use under the brand “Yacht-Pro™”. Our systems provide complete diving solutions for yachts, including nitrox systems which allow yacht owners to fill tanks with oxygen enriched air on board. The Yacht-Pro™ compressor systems offer a completely marine-prepared, variable frequency drive(“VFD”) driven, automated alternative to other compressors on the market. We also design complete dive lockers, mixed gas production and distribution systems, and the Nitrox Maker™. Nitrox is oxygen-enriched air, which reduces the effects of nitrogen on divers and is the industry standard for dive professionals. The Nitrox Maker™ continuously generates oxygen rich breathing gas directly from low-pressure air with no stored oxygen or other gases required onboard. Our light duty compressor, the new Yacht Pro Essential is specifically designed as a turn-key kit for the boat builders and is optimized to integrate to onboard power systems and withstand the marine environment with all components and hardware impervious to spray from the elements. The Yacht Pro™ series contains models for both medium-duty applications, such as recreational divers and small groups, and heavy-duty use as found on research vessels, commercial operations and live-aboard dive boats. All Yacht Pro™ models come with the variable speed frequency drive reducing the initial start-up power demand typically associated with high pressure compressor systems.

In August 2017, we entered into a five-year exclusive distribution agreement with L&W, which agreement renews for successive one-year terms unless terminated as provided for in the agreement. Under the terms of the Exclusive Distribution Agreement, we were appointed the exclusive distributor of L&W’s complete product line in North America and South America, including the Caribbean. We are conducting this business direct to end-users and establishing sales, distribution and service centers for high pressure air and industrial gas systems in the dive, fire, CNG, military, scientific, recreational and aerospace industries under the brand name “L&W Americas/LWA”.
 
We are exclusively developing a sales, distribution and service capability to assist L&W with completing a worldwide network of L&W’s agencies and service centers.
 
In addition to breathing air compressors and related peripheral equipment, L&W also offers compressors, storage and purification systems to meet the high-pressure requirements for natural gas filling stations, and high-pressure inert gases such as argon, helium and nitrogen for industrial applications including welding and laser cutting, and for general laboratory use.
 
We believe the product lines from L&W, will allow LW Americas to offer high quality, competitive products into the first responder and industrial market that utilize compressed air. Our goal will be to build a network of jobbers, dealers, installers and high-pressure compressor distributors by leveraging our know-how, brand awareness, complimentary products and creating sustainable distribution and core product original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) integration relationships.
 

Redundant Air Tank Systems
 
In September 2021, the Company acquired SSI to further expand its product offerings and manufacturing capabilities. SSI has been manufacturing redundant air systems for recreational divers, private companies and militaries throughout the world for more than 40 years. Their state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Huntington Beach, California is equipped to add to the machining and product development capabilities of the Company.
 
The SSI acquisition gives the Company access to a world-wide base of in excess of 400 dealers and distributors, GSA contracting capability, as well as the direct source for the redundant air needs for our Brownie’s Third Lung and BLU3 diving equipment and expands warehousing capabilities, reducing freight costs for both sets of customers.
 
SSI continues to innovate their technologies to meet changing military and commercial needs and is in development of the next generation of their Helicopter Emergency Egress Device (“HEED”) product line, specifically designed for aircraft and military vehicle use. Additionally, SSI has found use for their products in the medical field and continues to develop customer relationships in that area to grow revenue and diversify its product and customer portfolio.
 
Diving and Snorkeling Industry
 
The Sports, Fitness Industry Association (“SFIA”) estimated there were 2.6 million participants in the U.S. scuba diving market in 2020. According to a report published by the Dive Equipment Manufacturing Association (“DEMA”) in first quarter 2021, there were approximately 87,000 new participants in U.S. diving market in 2020 as compared to approximately 151,000 in 2019. DEMA attributes the drop in new open water certifications in 2020 primarily to the pandemic.
 
In contrast, the SFIA study indicated that participation in snorkeling increased by nearly 1% in 2020 as compared to 2019 with estimated participation of 7.7 million in the U.S.
 
The Company intends to enter the tourist market via a guided tour program that is currently intended to be launched in the second quarter of 2022. The Company sees the guided tour model as an important building block in introducing its battery powered diving products to the consumer market. Additionally, this model will not only give consumers the opportunity to “try before you buy”, but also provide experiential training for the consumer to increase enjoyment and safety of our diving products.

The majority of L&W high pressure compressors and NitroxMaker™ systems have been sold to commercial dive stores, dive operators (resorts and liveaboard dive boats), yacht builders, yacht owners and high pressure compressor distribution partners.
 
Sales of YachtPro™ compressor systems have been split between retail sales directly to consumers and wholesale sales to OEM boat builders/resellers/brokers.
 
Suppliers/Raw Materials
 
Principal raw materials for our business include machined parts such as rods; pistons; bearings; hoses; regulators; compressors; engines; high-pressure valves and fittings; sewn goods; and various plastic parts including pans, covers, intake staffs, and quick release connections which are typically purchased on a per order basis. Most materials are readily available from multiple vendors. Some materials require greater lead times than other materials. Accordingly, we strive to avoid out of stock situations through careful monitoring of these inventory lead times, and through avoiding single source vendors whenever possible. Principle suppliers include Lenhardt & Wagner GmbH, Xometry, Inc., Burgess Manufacturing Corp, Bix International, Inc., Carrol Stream Motor Company, Zhejiang Xiangyang Gear Electormechan, Co, Xiamen Feipeng Insdustry Co. Ltd. and Catalina Cylinders, Inc.
 
Competition
 
We consider the most significant competitive factors in our business to be innovation, lifestyle, fair prices, shopping convenience, the variety of available products, knowledgeable and prompt customer service, rapid and accurate fulfillment of orders. We currently recognize one significant competitor Airline by JSink, Inc.in gasoline powered hookah sales and a variety of competitors, including Aqua Lung America, Colti America and Bauer Compressors, Inc. in our redundant air tank systems and high-pressure compressor systems sales. Currently, we believe there is limited competition for our BLU3, Sea Lion and BIAS systems products.
 
Overall, we are operating in a moderately competitive environment. The price structure for all the products we distribute compares favorably with the majority of our competitors based on quality and available features. We believe that our key competitive advantage is our ability to create new products and in some cases, new markets.
 
Employees 
 
We currently have four full-time employees. Our subsidiaries have 31 full-time and 1 part-time employee, in the aggregate.
 
Seasonality 
 
Our product lines have historically been seasonal in nature in the United States. The peak season for Legacy Products and Redundant Air Tank Systems is the second and third quarters of the year. The peak season for High Pressure products is typically the fourth and first quarters of the year. The BLU3 product line is emerging as a less seasonally influenced enterprise due to the global appeal. The Company continues to address the seasonality of the business by expanding its reach beyond the traditional markets in the U.S. and reaching to other areas of the world that may somewhat offset the seasonality.
