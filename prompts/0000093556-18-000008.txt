ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. ("the Company") was founded 175 years ago, in 1843, by Frederick T. Stanley and incorporated in Connecticut in 1852. In March 2010, the Company completed a merger ("the Merger") with The Black & Decker Corporation (“Black & Decker”), a company founded by S. Duncan Black and Alonzo G. Decker and incorporated in Maryland in 1910. At that time, the Company changed its name from The Stanley Works ("Stanley") to Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. 
The Company is a diversified global provider of hand tools, power tools and related accessories, engineered fastening systems and products, services and equipment for oil & gas and infrastructure applications, commercial electronic security and monitoring systems, healthcare solutions, and mechanical access solutions (primarily automatic doors), with 2017 consolidated annual revenues of $12.7 billion. Approximately 54% of the Company’s 2017 revenues were generated in the United States, with the remainder largely from Europe (22%), emerging markets (14%) and Canada (5%). 
The Company continues to pursue a growth and acquisition strategy that involves industry, geographic and customer diversification to foster sustainable revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. The Company remains focused on organic growth, including increasing its presence in emerging markets, and leveraging the Stanley Fulfillment System ("SFS 2.0"), which focuses on digital excellence, commercial excellence, breakthrough innovation, core SFS operating principles, and functional transformation. In addition, the Company continues to make strides towards achieving its 22/22 Vision of reaching $22 billion in revenue by 2022 while expanding the margin rate, by becoming known as one of the world’s leading innovators, delivering top-quartile financial performance and elevating its commitment to social responsibility.
Execution of the above strategy has already resulted in approximately $8.9 billion of acquisitions since 2002 (excluding the Black & Decker merger and pending acquisition of the Nelson Fastener Systems industrial business, as discussed below), which was enabled by strong cash flow generation and increased debt capacity. This strategy is further exemplified by the Company's March 2017 acquisitions of the Tools business of Newell Brands ("Newell Tools") for approximately $1.84 billion and the Craftsman® brand from Sears Holdings Corporation ("Sears Holdings") for an estimated cash purchase price of approximately $900 million on a discounted basis. The Newell Tools acquisition, which includes the industrial cutting, hand tool and power tool accessory brands Irwin® and Lenox®, enhances the Company’s position within the global tools & storage industry and broadens the Company’s product offerings and solutions to customers and end users, particularly within power tool accessories. The Craftsman acquisition provides the Company with the rights to develop, manufacture and sell Craftsman®-branded products in non-Sears Holdings channels. Furthermore, on December 22, 2017, the Company reached an agreement to purchase the industrial business of Nelson Fastener Systems ("Nelson") from the Doncasters Group, which excludes Nelson's automotive stud welding business, for approximately $440 million in cash. This acquisition is complementary to the Company's product offerings, enhances its presence in the general industrial end markets and expands its portfolio of highly engineered fastening solutions. This transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approval, is expected to close in the first half of 2018. Refer to Note E, Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion. 
In February 2017, the Company completed the sale of the majority of its mechanical security businesses, which included the commercial hardware brands of Best Access, phi Precision and GMT, for net proceeds of approximately $717 million. This sale allowed the Company to deploy capital in a more accretive and growth-oriented manner. The Company has also divested several smaller businesses in recent years that did not fit into its long-term strategic objectives. Refer to Note T, Divestitures, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion.
At December 30, 2017, the Company employed 57,765 people worldwide. The Company’s principal executive office is located at 1000 Stanley Drive, New Britain, Connecticut 06053 and its telephone number is (860) 225-5111.
Description of the Business
The Company’s operations are classified into three reportable business segments, which also represent its operating segments: Tools & Storage, Industrial and Security. All segments have significant international operations and are exposed to translational and transactional impacts from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
Additional information regarding the Company’s business segments and geographic areas is incorporated herein by reference to the material captioned “Business Segment Results” in Item 7 and Note P, Business Segments and Geographic Areas, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Tools & Storage
The Tools & Storage segment is comprised of the Power Tools and Equipment ("PTE") and Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage ("HTAS") businesses. The segment sells its products to professional end users, distributors, retail consumers and industrial customers in a wide variety of industries and geographies. The majority of sales are distributed through retailers, including home centers, mass merchants, hardware stores, and retail lumber yards, as well as third-party distributors and a direct sales force. Annual revenues in the Tools & Storage segment were $8.9 billion in 2017, representing 70% of the Company’s total revenues.
The PTE business includes both professional and consumer products. Professional products include professional grade corded and cordless electric power tools and equipment including drills, impact wrenches and drivers, grinders, saws, routers and sanders, as well as pneumatic tools and fasteners including nail guns, nails, staplers and staples, concrete and masonry anchors. Consumer products include corded and cordless electric power tools sold primarily under the BLACK+DECKER® brand, lawn and garden products, including hedge trimmers, string trimmers, lawn mowers, edgers and related accessories, and home products such as hand-held vacuums, paint tools and cleaning appliances. 
The HTAS business sells hand tools, power tool accessories and storage products. Hand tools include measuring, leveling and layout tools, planes, hammers, demolition tools, clamps, vises, knives, saws, chisels and industrial and automotive tools. Power tool accessories include drill bits, screwdriver bits, router bits, abrasives, saw blades and threading products. Storage products include tool boxes, sawhorses, medical cabinets and engineered storage solution products.
Industrial
The Industrial segment is comprised of the Engineered Fastening and Infrastructure businesses. Annual revenues in the Industrial segment were $1.9 billion in 2017, representing 15% of the Company’s total revenues.
The Engineered Fastening business primarily sells engineered fastening products and systems designed for specific applications. The product lines include blind rivets and tools, blind inserts and tools, drawn arc weld studs and systems, engineered plastic and mechanical fasteners, self-piercing riveting systems and precision nut running systems, micro fasteners, and high-strength structural fasteners. The business sells to customers in the automotive, manufacturing, electronics, and aerospace industries, amongst others, and its products are distributed through direct sales forces and, to a lesser extent, third-party distributors.
The Infrastructure business consists of the Oil & Gas and Hydraulics businesses. The Oil & Gas business sells and rents custom pipe handling, joint welding and coating equipment used in the construction of large and small diameter pipelines, and provides pipeline inspection services. The Hydraulics business sells hydraulic tools and accessories. The Infrastructure businesses sell to the oil and natural gas pipeline industry and other industrial customers. The products and services are primarily distributed through a direct sales force and, to a lesser extent, third-party distributors.
Security
The Security segment is comprised of the Convergent Security Solutions ("CSS") and Mechanical Access Solutions ("MAS") businesses. Annual revenues in the Security segment were $1.9 billion in 2017, representing 15% of the Company’s total revenues.
The CSS business designs, supplies and installs commercial electronic security systems and provides electronic security services, including alarm monitoring, video surveillance, fire alarm monitoring, systems integration and system maintenance. Purchasers of these systems typically contract for ongoing security systems monitoring and maintenance at the time of initial equipment installation. The business also sells healthcare solutions, which include asset tracking, infant protection, pediatric protection, patient protection, wander management, fall management, and emergency call products. The CSS business sells to consumers, retailers, educational, financial and healthcare institutions, as well as commercial, governmental and industrial customers. The MAS business primarily sells automatic doors to commercial customers. Products for both businesses are sold predominantly on a direct sales basis.

Other Information
Competition
The Company competes on the basis of its reputation for product quality, its well-known brands, its commitment to customer service, strong customer relationships, the breadth of its product lines and its innovative products and customer value propositions.
The Company encounters active competition in the Tools & Storage and Industrial segments from both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services. Certain large customers offer private label brands (“house brands”) that compete across a wider spectrum of the Company’s Tools & Storage segment product offerings. Competition in the Security segment is generally fragmented via both large international players and regional companies. Competition tends to be based primarily on price, the quality of service and comprehensiveness of the services offered to the customers.
Major Customers
A significant portion of the Company’s Tools & Storage products are sold to home centers and mass merchants in the U.S. and Europe. A consolidation of retailers both in North America and abroad has occurred over time. While this consolidation and the domestic and international expansion of these large retailers have provided the Company with opportunities for growth, the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree of exposure to potential sales volume loss. One customer, Lowe's, accounted for 11.7% of the Company's consolidated sales in 2017. No other customer exceeded 10% of consolidated sales in 2017, 2016 or 2015. 
Working Capital
The Company continues to practice the five operating principles encompassed by Core SFS, one component of the SFS 2.0 operating system, which work in concert: sales and operations planning ("S&OP"), operational lean, complexity reduction, global supply management, and order-to-cash excellence. The Company develops standardized business processes and system platforms to reduce costs and provide scalability. Core SFS is instrumental in the reduction of working capital as evidenced by the 51% improvement in the Company's working capital turns from 5.9 at the end of 2010 (directly after the Black & Decker merger) to 8.9 at the end of 2017. Excluding the 2017 acquisitions and divestitures, working capital turns were consistent with the record in the prior year of 10.6 turns. The continued efforts to deploy Core SFS across the entire Company and increase working capital turns have created significant opportunities to generate incremental free cash flow (defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures). The Company plans to continue leveraging Core SFS to generate ongoing improvements, both in the existing business and future acquisitions, in working capital turns, cycle times, complexity reduction and customer service levels, with a long-term goal of sustaining 10+ working capital turns.
Raw Materials
The Company’s products are manufactured using ferrous and non-ferrous metals including, but not limited to, steel, zinc, copper, brass, aluminum and nickel as well as resins. The Company also purchases components such as batteries, motors, and electronic components to use in manufacturing and assembly operations along with resin-based molded parts. The raw materials required are procured globally and generally available from multiple sources at competitive prices. As part of the Company's Enterprise Risk Management, the Company has implemented a supplier risk mitigation strategy in order to identify and address any potential supply disruption associated with commodities, components, finished goods and critical services. The Company does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining supplies for any raw materials or energy used in its production processes.
Backlog
Due to short order cycles and rapid inventory turnover primarily in the Company's Tools & Storage segment, backlog is generally not considered a significant indicator of future performance. At February 3, 2018, the Company had approximately $929 million in unfilled orders, which mainly relate to the Engineered Fastening and Security businesses. Substantially all of these orders are reasonably expected to be filled within the current fiscal year. As of February 4, 2017 and February 6, 2016 unfilled orders amounted to $838 million and $783 million, respectively.
Patents and Trademarks
No business segment is solely dependent, to any significant degree, on patents, licenses, franchises or concessions, and the loss of one or several of these patents, licenses, franchises or concessions would not have a material adverse effect on any of the Company's businesses. The Company owns numerous patents, none of which individually is material to the Company's operations as a whole. These patents expire at various times over the next 20 years. The Company holds licenses, franchises

and concessions, none of which individually or in the aggregate are material to the Company's operations as a whole. These licenses, franchises and concessions vary in duration, but generally run from one to 40 years. 
The Company has numerous trademarks that are used in its businesses worldwide. In the Tools & Storage segment, significant trademarks include STANLEY®, BLACK+DECKER®, DEWALT®, FLEXVOLT®, Irwin®, Lenox®, Craftsman®, Porter-Cable®, BOSTITCH®, FatMax®, Powers®, Guaranteed Tough®, Innerspace®, Mac Tools®, Proto®, Vidmar®, Facom®, USAG™, DIYZ®, Lista®, and the yellow & black color scheme for power tools and accessories. Significant trademarks in the Industrial segment include STANLEY®, CRC®, LaBounty®, Dubuis®, AeroScout®, Cribmaster®, Expert®, SIDCHROME™, POP®, Warren®, GRIPCO®, Avdel®, HeliCoil®, MasterFix®, Tucker®, NPR®, Dodge®, and Spiralock®. The Security segment includes significant trademarks such as STANLEY®, Blick™, HSM®, Sargent & Greenleaf®, S&G®, SONITROL®, Stanley Access Technologies™, AeroScout®, Hugs®, WanderGuard®, Roam Alert®, MyCall®, Arial® and Bed-Check®. The terms of these trademarks typically vary from 10 to 20 years, with most trademarks being renewable indefinitely for like terms.
Environmental Regulations
The Company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign countries where it has operations. In the normal course of business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings relating to environmental issues. The Company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. The amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. The liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties. As assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had reserves of $176.1 million and $160.9 million, respectively, for remediation activities associated with Company-owned properties, as well as for Superfund sites, for losses that are probable and estimable. Of the 2017 amount, $22.5 million is classified as current and $153.6 million as long-term, which is expected to be paid over the estimated remediation period. As of December 30, 2017, the Company has recorded $12.2 million in other assets related to funding by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and monies received have been placed in trust in accordance with the Consent Decree associated with the West Coast Loading Corporation ("WCLC") proceedings, as further discussed in Note S, Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Accordingly, the Company's cash obligation as of December 30, 2017 associated with the aforementioned remediation activities is $163.9 million. The range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is $143.4 million to $277.1 million, which is subject to change in the near term. The Company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns. Liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with policy.
The amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. Actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates, given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future contingent liability costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with these matters in excess of the amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Additional information regarding environmental matters is available in Note S, Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Employees
At December 30, 2017, the Company had 57,765 employees, 16,055 of whom are employed in the U.S. Employees in the U.S. totaling 1,237 are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with 27 different local labor unions who are, in turn, affiliated with approximately 6 different international labor unions. The majority of the Company’s hourly-paid and weekly-paid employees outside the U.S. are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company’s labor agreements in the U.S. expire between 2018 and 2021. There have been no significant interruptions of the Company’s operations in recent years due to labor disputes. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is good.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs, which are classified in SG&A, were $252.3 million, $204.4 million and $188.0 million for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2017 reflects the Company's continued focus on growth investments and its commitment to the SFS 2.0 Breakthrough Innovation initiative.
