Our Offices
 
Our headquarter office and manufacturing facility are located at 664 Cruiser Lane, Belgrade, Montana 59714.  Our telephone number is (406) 388-0480 and our fax number is (406) 388-1354.  We also have two other facilities on the Montana campus, located at 600 Cruiser Lane, Belgrade, Montana 59714, and at 732 Cruiser Lane, Belgrade, Montana 59714, one Colorado office located at 363 Centennial Parkway, Suite 220, Louisville, Colorado 80027, and one Ohio office at 452 Alexandersville Road, Miamisburg, Ohio 45342. All our properties are leased.
Our History
 
We began operations in 1998 as a spin out of the Center for Biofilm Engineering at Montana State University, or the CBE, and we eventually incorporated as “Bacterin, Inc.” in the state of Montana in January 2000. We began as a biomaterial testing laboratory and systematically expanded our strategic vision towards the development of Bacterin-labeled products. Our revenues were initially derived from testing services and milestone payments under collaborative product development agreements with various medical manufacturers.
 
In March 2004, Bacterin, Inc.’s stockholders entered into a share exchange agreement with a company called Oil & Gas Seekers, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“OGS”) which subsequently changed its name to “Bacterin International, Inc.,” to effectively become a publicly-traded corporation. As a result of this transaction, the stockholders of Bacterin, Inc., the Montana corporation, became stockholders of Bacterin International, Inc., the Nevada corporation, and Bacterin, Inc., became a wholly owned subsidiary of Bacterin International, Inc. At the end of 2004, we concluded this transaction was problematic and did not deliver the expected result. Based on this determination, we entered into an agreement in 2005 to amend the terms of the exchange transaction with the former majority stockholder of OGS. In May 2005, we merged Bacterin, Inc., the Montana corporation, up and into Bacterin International, Inc., the Nevada corporation.

On June 30, 2010, Bacterin International, Inc. merged with and into a wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary of Bacterin International Holdings, Inc. f/k/a K-Kitz Incorporated, a Delaware corporation, and as a result, Bacterin International, Inc. (“Bacterin”) became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Before this reverse merger, Bacterin International Holdings, Inc. was known as K-Kitz, Incorporated, with a trading symbol of KKTZ.OB. On June 29, 2010, K-Kitz Incorporated changed its corporate name to “Bacterin International Holdings, Inc.” which name change became effective for trading purposes on July 1, 2010, following the reverse merger transaction. Effective July 21, 2010, our trading symbol was changed from KKTZ.OB to BIHI.OB. On March 7, 2011, our common stock began trading on the NYSE Amex, which is now known as the NYSE American under the ticker symbol “BONE.”
 
On July 31, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of X-spine Systems, Inc. (“X-Spine”) for approximately $60 million in cash, repayment of approximately $13 million of X-spine debt, and approximately 4.24 million shares (0.4 million shares post reverse split) of Xtant common stock. X-spine is engaged in the development, manufacturing and sale of implants and medical devices for use in orthopedic spinal surgeries. As a result of this transaction, X-Spine became a wholly owned subsidiary of Bacterin International Holdings, Inc.
 
At the close of business on July 31, 2015, we changed our corporate name to “Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc.” On August 6, 2015, Xtant formed a new wholly owned subsidiary, Xtant Medical, Inc., a Delaware corporation to facilitate the integration of Bacterin and X-spine. On October 15, 2015, our common stock began trading on the NYSE MKT under the ticker symbol “XTNT.” X-spine is engaged in the development, manufacturing and sale of implants and medical devices for use in orthopedic spinal surgeries. Xtant, Bacterin and X-spine are jointly referred to herein as the “Company”.
 
Industry and Market Overview
 
The orthopedic biomaterials market consists of materials that are organic, inorganic or synthetic in nature. These materials are implanted or applied in or near the indicated bone to facilitate healing, encourage bone tissue augmentation, compensate in areas where bone tissue is depleted and restore structure to allow for repair. Orthopedic biomaterials are capable of producing specific biological action or regenerative responses that are beyond what is observed in normal healing. These materials are often used as substitutes to autograft materials, which are taken from a harvest site in the patient to patch or repair the wounded or unhealthy site. Bone is a biologically active tissue and may or may not regenerate depending on the condition of the patient.  The damage may be significant enough that a scaffold may be necessary to help regenerate the surgical site.
 
Fixation is often instrumental in allowing the body to heal and regenerate tissue. It provides the constructive support necessary for reestablishing stability, by immobilizing the regenerative site, and relieving stress. Fixation can also help hold the biomaterial in place in order to achieve a better outcome. Examples of fixation products can include, but is not limited to, plates, screws, pins, rods, spacers, and staples, and may be made from various metals and polymer materials.
 
CRO Agreement
 
On May 8, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement (the “CRO Agreement”) with Aurora Management Partners Inc. (“Aurora”). Pursuant to the CRO Agreement, David Baker serves as Chief Restructuring Officer of the Company (the “CRO”).  The CRO and Aurora personnel, referred to as Deputy Restructuring officers, assisting on this engagement report to the special restructuring committee of the board of directors of the Company and provide periodic updates on progress made in fulfilling the scope of services.  The term of the agreement will continue until the engagement is completed or earlier if the engagement is terminated by either party. Aurora is paid the hourly rates set forth on Schedule A to the CRO Agreement and is reimbursed for its expenses actually incurred in providing the services.  The CRO Agreement may be terminated by either party, in its sole discretion, for any reason and the termination is effective immediately upon the other party’s receipt of written notice of the termination.

Technology and Intellectual Property
 
Patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property owned by others.
Patents
 
Our biomaterial patent efforts are focused on the development of innovative and novel, engineered tissue implants or constructs which employ acellular tissue and processes, and enhanced demineralized bone matrix products. On November 5, 2013, the United States (“U.S.”) Patent and Trademark Office issued U.S. Patent No. 8,574,825 entitled “Process for Demineralization of Bone Matrix with Preservation of Natural Growth Factors.” The issued claims in the patent are for a method to produce a demineralized cancellous bone matrix, such as Bacterin’s OsteoSponge® product line. The Company has a pending divisional application in the United States to pursue protection of other aspects of its bone demineralization technology. We have other provisional applications pending in the United States and other countries that relate to aspects of the technology used in many of our products. Our policy is to file patent applications in the United States and other countries when we believe it is commercially advantageous to do so. We do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent.

The fixation product portfolio includes over 50 issued patents globally and over 30 patent applications pending. In addition to current product offerings, Xtant continues to invest in the research and development necessary to design, develop and commercialize new surgical solutions for unmet clinical needs.
 
We believe our patent filings and patent position will facilitate growth and enhance our proprietary core competencies. We expect that additional patent applications will be filed and prosecuted as inventions are discovered, technological improvements and processes are developed and specific applications are identified. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain final approval of any patents. 
 
Trademarks
 
We have registered, and continue to seek registration, of trademarks and continuously monitor and aggressively pursue users of names and marks that potentially infringe upon our registered trademarks.  We currently own the following registered trademarks under the Bacterin name:  OsteoSponge ®, OsteoVine ®, OsteoWrap ®, OsteoLock ®, BacFast ®, OsteoSelect ®, Elutia ®, OsteoSTX ®, hMatrix ®, 3Demin®, BACTERINSE ®, and Circle of Life ®. Under the X-spine name, we own the following registered trademarks: SILEX®, X-SPINE®, IRIX®, CAPLESS®, CERTEX®, CALIX®, H-GRAFT®, SPIDER, X90®, HYDRAGRAFT®, BUTREX®, FORTEX®, AXLE®, FIXCET®, Capless® and X-spine’s square design logo.
Trade Secrets
 
To safeguard our proprietary knowledge and technology, we rely upon trade secret protection and non-disclosure/confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and third-party collaboration partners with access to our confidential information. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will adequately protect against the unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, or that third parties will not be able to independently develop similar technology. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any agreements concerning confidentiality and non-disclosure will not be breached, or if breached, that we will have an adequate remedy to protect us against losses. Although we believe our proprietary technology has value, because of rapid technological changes in the medical industry, we also believe that proprietary protection is of less significance than factors such as the intrinsic knowledge and experience of our management, advisory board, consultants and personnel and their ability to identify unmet market needs and to create, invent, develop and market innovative and differentiated products. 
Donor Procurement
 
We have agreements with multiple recovery agencies and we continue to expand our network for access to donor tissue in anticipation of increased demand.  We expect to be able to continue to build our network for donor tissue as our processing capabilities and sales increase.
Sales and Marketing
 
We promote our product in the United States through a hybrid distribution network including direct employees, sales agents and independent distributors.
 
Our international footprint includes distribution partners in Canada, Mexico, South America, Europe, Middle East, Australia, South Korea, and Taiwan. Xtant continues to evaluate new, global market opportunities and expects to expand the number of international markets served.
Growth Strategy
 
In an effort to capitalize on our core markets, as well as new market opportunities, we have diversified our supply of donor tissue, expanded our processing capabilities and are further developing a hybrid sales force. We have focused our United States sales activities on Orthopedic Surgeons and Neuro Surgeons performing spine procedures, and development of strategic distribution relationships.
 
We are pursuing a high-level, national effort to present our products as a value proposition to hospital systems and other purchasing organizations. To this end, we have entered into agreements with Banner Hospitals, Dignity Health, OhioHealth, Franciscan Health System, the Hospital for Special Surgery, Beaumont Health, Providence, Sutter, Community Health Services, Sharp Healthcare, Franciscan Alliance, Pinnacle Health Systems, Proliance Surgeons, Baptist Health South Florida, MedAssets, Novation, Premier, ROi, Health Trust Purchasing Group, Scripps and Bon Secours among others. These agreements are paving the way for our sales representatives to call on additional physicians, as the hospital process has already been approved.

Competition
 
There are various public and private organizations that offer both, fixation and orthobiologics to their customers. With the growing market, and ongoing pressures to expand and make product portfolios more robust, we expect several new products and new companies will emerge over the coming years. We consider our direct competitors to be orthopedic companies that offer both spinal fixation and biologics, such as NuVasive, RTI Surgical, SeaSpine, Medtronic, OrthoFix, Stryker, Alphatec, Zimmer Biomet, DePuy/Synthes, Medtronic, K2 Medical, and Globus Medical. We also compete with some hardware companies that do not currently market a biologic, such as LDR Holding Company, and tissue banks that do not specialize in spinal fixation materials, such as AlloSource, Lifenet Health, and MTF.
Government Regulation
 
We are registered with the FDA as a manufacturer of human cellular and tissue products (“HCT/Ps”) as well as medical devices, and we are an accredited member in good standing of the American Association of Tissue Banks.  We meet all licensing requirements for the distribution of HCT/Ps in states with licensing requirements, including Florida, California, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Oregon, and New York.  Our industry is highly regulated and we cannot predict the impact of future regulations on either us or our customers.
 
Our fixation products and instrumentation systems are regulated as medical devices and therefore are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, as well as by other domestic and international regulatory bodies. These regulations govern multiple activities that Xtant and suppliers, licensors and partners perform and will continue to perform. These regulated activities include product design and development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, safety, premarket clearance, advertising and promotion, product marketing, sales and distribution, post-market surveillance and post-market adverse event reporting. All products currently marketed by Xtant are regulated as HCT/Ps or have received 510(k) clearances.
 
Human Tissue
 
Human tissue products have been regulated by the FDA since 1993. In May 2005, three new comprehensive regulations went into effect that address manufacturing activities associated with HCT/Ps. The first requires that companies that produce and distribute HCT/Ps register with the FDA. The second provides criteria that must be met for donors to be eligible to donate tissues and is referred to as the “Donor Eligibility” rule. The third rule governs the processing and distribution of the tissues and is often referred to as the “Current Good Tissue Practices” rule. Together, they are designed to ensure that sound, high quality practices are followed to reduce the risk of tissue contamination and communicable disease transmission to recipients.  Several of our products including OsteoSponge and OsteoWrap are regulated as HCT/Ps as determined by the Tissue Reference Group and regulated under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and 21 CFR Part 1271.
Medical Devices
 
Our medical devices require the clearance of the FDA prior to sale within the United States. The FDA process requires a premarket notification, or a 510(k) submission, to the FDA to demonstrate that the medical device is safe and effective and is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval.  Applicants must compare the device to one or more similar devices that are commercially available in the United States (known as the “predicate device”), and make and support a claim of substantial equivalency to such predicate device.  Support for such claims must include descriptive data and, when necessary, performance data.  In some cases, data from clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) submission.  The FDA must then issue an order finding substantial equivalency before the devices may be commercially distributed in the United States.  The Center for Devices and Radiological Health Division of the FDA governs HCT/Ps that are regulated as medical devices, including our OsteoSelect DBM putty.
 
The discussion of what data is needed is sometimes conducted in a formal process called the Pre-Submission process whereby companies meet with FDA to discuss the data needed for clearance. If the FDA finds the applicant’s device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device it will send a letter to the applicant stating that fact. This allows the applicant’s device to be commercially distributed in the United States. The Center for Devices and Radiological Health division of the FDA governs the clearance of conventional medical devices such as our spinal hardware as well as some of the HCT/Ps that are also regulated as medical devices, such as our OsteoSelect DBM putty.
 
Another procedure for obtaining marketing authorization for a medical device is the “de novo classification” procedure. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous premarket approval or “PMA” requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. A company files for a de novo approval when it does not have a predicate to which it can claim substantial equivalence. Once a de novo application is reviewed and approved, it results in the device having a Class II status and future devices from the company or a competitor may use the company de novo-approved device as a 510(k) predicate. A de novo approval is reserved for Class II moderate risk devices and a company must show that special controls can be created which subsequent applicants can follow to obtain a 510(k) clearance. The advantage of the de novo approval is that it requires less data than a PMA. The disadvantage is that it may require more data than a 510(k) and most often will include human clinical data. FDA is increasingly moving devices with slightly different proposed indication statements or different technological features off the 510(k) path and on to the de novo path resulting in more time and expense for the company.

The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Products that are approved through a PMA application generally need FDA approval before they can be modified. Similarly, some modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k) or a PMA.
 
In the future, Xtant may decide to strategically commercialize products in the United States that would require a PMA, but there are no plans to do so at the present time. Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA.
 
International Regulation
 
Many foreign countries have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to the FDA. International sales are subject to foreign government regulation, the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in a foreign country or to obtain a CE Certificate of Conformity may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the related requirements may differ. Some third-world countries accept CE Certificates of Conformity or FDA clearance or approval as part of applications of approval for marketing of medical devices in their territory. Other countries, including Brazil, Canada, Australia and Japan, require separate regulatory filings.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse
 
Healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to Xtant’s business when a customer submits a claim for an item or service that is reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid or most other federally-funded healthcare programs. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal health care programs, such as by Medicare or Medicaid. The concerns that the Anti-Kickback Statute addresses are multiple, but primary among them are, first, that the federal government pays/reimburses health care providers for the true acquisition cost of goods and services provided to patients served by government programs. The government does not want, for example, health care providers obtaining manufacturer discounts which are not disclosed to the government on cost report forms submitted for reimbursement to the government. The government wants to be the beneficiary of such discounts. Second, for that reason, the government wants transparency in the billing process which discloses such discounts to the government. Third, the government does not want purchasing, prescription or referral decisions for medical devices biased by economics unrelated to the best choices for a patient.
 
The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations and has been applied by government enforcement officials to a number of common business arrangements in the medical device industry. Remunerative relationships with physicians in which manufacturers give health care providers gifts or pay for entertainment, sporting events, trips or other perquisites, may be viewed as an attempt to buy loyalty to the manufacturer’s products. A number of states also have anti-kickback laws that establish similar prohibitions that may apply to items or services reimbursed by government programs as well as any third-party payors, including commercial insurers.
 
Further, recently enacted federal legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively “PPACA”), among other things, clarified the intent requirements of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal criminal statutes governing healthcare fraud. Specifically, a person or entity can be found to have violated the statutes without actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the PPACA amended the Social Security Act to provide that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute. Recent amendments to the Federal False Claims Act provide that a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is also a violation of the Federal False Claims Act, subjecting healthcare entities to treble damages and mandatory penalties for each false claim or statement.

Additionally, the civil Federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment of federal funds, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The purpose of the Federal False Claims Act is to prevent manufacturers from causing or inducing inappropriate prescriptions leading to an inappropriate government reimbursement. It often comes into play where a manufacturer suggests or assists a health care provider to bill for an off-label, uncovered use. It also can occur when the reimbursement advice given by a manufacturer results in inappropriate reimbursement claims from “upcoding,” miscoding, “stretched” coding, the use of inappropriate modifiers or inappropriate care settings. These behaviors can result in the government paying for products or procedures that should not be reimbursed by the federal government. The manufacturer must be truthful and not misleading in the reimbursement advice it gives to customers.
 
Actions under the Federal False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the Federal False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the Federal False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare companies throughout the country for a wide variety of Medicare billing practices, as well as federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, and has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the Federal False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and suppliers’ compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws.
 
The Federal False Claims Act amendments in 2009 and 2010 expanded the scope of the liability for health care entities generally to potentially reach violations of regulatory duties, such as good manufacturing practices. There have been large settlements in the life sciences arena related to FDA regulatory violations for promotional activities and good manufacturing practice.
 
Even in instances where a company may have no actual liability, the Federal False Claims Act private citizen provisions (qui tam) allow the filing of Federal False Claims Act actions under seal and impose a mandatory duty on the United States Department of Justice to investigate such allegations. Most private citizen actions are declined by the Department of Justice or dismissed by federal courts. However, the investigation costs for a company can be significant and material even if the allegations are without merit.
 
Federal False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the health industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory minimum penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim or statement. Because of the potential for large monetary exposure, health care companies resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages that may awarded in litigation proceedings. They may be required, however, to enter into corporate integrity agreements with the government, which may impose substantial costs to companies to ensure compliance.
 
The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes annual reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians (including physician family members) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year, and up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for “knowing failures.” Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements.
 
If a governmental authority were to conclude that Xtant is not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, Xtant and its officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties, including, for example, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. Our United States operations are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). We are required to comply with the FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded United States corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of “off books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. We also are subject to similar anticorruption legislation implemented in Europe under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.

Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Xtant’s currently approved products are commonly treated as general supplies utilized in spinal and orthopedic surgery and if covered by third-party payors, are paid for as part of the surgical procedure. Accordingly, healthcare providers in the United States generally rely on third-party payors, principally private insurers and governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of a spine surgery in which Xtant products are used. Sales volumes and fees for Xtant products will continue to depend in large part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from such third-party payors. Third-party payors perform analyses on new technologies to determine if they are medically necessary before providing coverage for them. These third-party payors may still deny reimbursement on covered technologies if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with the payor’s coverage policy. Particularly in the United States, third-party payors continue to carefully review, and increasingly challenge, the prices charged for procedures and medical products.
 
In the United States, a large percentage of insured individuals receive their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. Some managed care programs pay their providers on a per capita basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying these providers a predetermined payment per member per month and, consequently, may limit the willingness of these providers to use Xtant products.
 
The overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will likely continue to lead to increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. Government or private third-party payors cannot be guaranteed to cover and reimburse the procedures using Xtant products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate. In addition, it is possible that future legislation, regulation or coverage and reimbursement policies of third-party payors will adversely affect the demand for Xtant products or the ability to sell them on a profitable basis.
 
Internationally, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary substantially from country to country and include single-payor, government-managed systems as well as systems in which private payors and government managed systems exist side-by-side.  Xtant’s ability to achieve market acceptance or significant sales volume in international markets will be dependent in large part on the availability of reimbursement for procedures performed using company products under the healthcare payment systems in such markets. A number of countries may require Xtant to gather additional clinical data before recognizing coverage and reimbursement for its products.
