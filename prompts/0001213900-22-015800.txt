Item 1. Business
Company Overview



We were incorporated as “Alba Mineral Exploration, Inc.” on July 24, 2007, in the State of Delaware for the purpose of engaging in the exploration of mineral properties. On October 21, 2009, we entered into an exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Diamond Information Institute, Inc. (“Diamond Information Institute”), whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Diamond Information Institute and changed the name of the company to Bergio International, Inc. On February 19, 2020, the Company changed its state of incorporation to the State of Wyoming.



The Bergio brand is our most important asset. The Bergio brand is associated with high-quality, handcrafted and individually designed pieces with European sensibility, Italian craftsmanship and a bold flair for the unexpected. Bergio, is one of the most coveted brands of fine jewelry. Established in 1995, Bergio’s signature innovative design, coupled with extraordinary diamonds and precious stones, earned the company recognition as a highly sought-after purveyor of rare and exquisite treasures from around the globe. As President, CEO and Head Designer of Bergio, Berge Abajian performs a highly successful balancing act, accomplished with equal parts precision and passion. An informed and inspirational leader, Berge directs the company with the eye and soul of a designer and the mind of a businessman. The role that is perhaps closest to his heart, however, is that of designer. With family jewelry roots reaching back the 1930s, Berge is a third-generation jeweler and a purist when it comes to design. Berge’s understanding of every aspect, in both design and manufacturing, creates collections that are nothing short of peerless in craftsmanship and style. Berge creates a collection; he looks well beyond the drawing board. Berge focuses on the woman who will ultimately wear his pieces, bringing to creation a magnificent piece of jewelry that reflects the beauty and vitality a woman possesses. Bergio creations are a seamless blend of classic elegance and subtle flair, adding to a woman’s charm while never overpowering her.



It is our intention to establish Bergio as a holding company for the purpose of establishing retails stores worldwide. Our branded product lines are products and/or collections designed by our designer and CEO Berge Abajian and will be the centerpiece of our retail stores. We also intend to complement our own quality-designed jewelry with other products and our own specially designed handbags. This is in line with our strategy and belief that a brand name can create an association with innovation, design and quality which helps add value to the individual products as well as facilitate the introduction of new products.



It is our intention to open elegant stores in “high-end” areas and provide excellent service in our stores which will be staffed with knowledgeable professionals.



We also intend to sell our products on a wholesale basis to limited customers.



On March 5, 2014, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary called Crown Luxe, Inc. in the State of Delaware (“Crown Luxe”). Crown Lux was established to operate the Company’s first retail store, which was opened in Bergen County, New Jersey in 2014.



During the fall of 2018, we opened our second retail store at the new Ocean Resort Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. We are also contemplating the opening of new stores in the future.



The Company’s plan is also to expand its online presence and take advantage of the Bergio Brand.



On February 10, 2021, we entered into an Acquisition Agreement with Digital Age Business, Inc., a Florida corporation, (“Digital Age Business”), pursuant to which the shareholders of Digital Age Business agreed to sell all of the assets and liabilities of its Aphrodite’s business to a recently formed subsidiary of the Company known as Aphrodite’s Marketing, Inc. (“Aphrodite’s Marketing”), a Wyoming corporation in exchange for newly created Series B Preferred Stock of the Company, which collectively, shall be convertible at Shareholders’ option, at any time, in whole or in part, into that number of shares of common stock of the Company which shall equal thirty percent (30%) of the total issued and outstanding common stock of the Company (as determined at the earlier of (i) the date of conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock; and (ii) eighteen (18) months following the Closing). We own 51% of Aphrodite’s Marketing. In addition, the Company will provide an additional $5,000,000 in financing for Aphrodite’s Marketing, Inc. (See Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail and Form 8-K file with the SEC on February 17, 2021).











On July 1, 2021 (“Closing”), we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with GearBubble, Inc., a Nevada corporation, (“GearBubble”), pursuant to which the shareholders of GearBubble (the “Equity Recipients”) agreed to sell 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of GearBubble to a recently formed subsidiary of the Company known as GearBubble Tech, Inc. (“GearBubble Tech”), a Wyoming corporation in exchange for $3,162,000 (the “Cash Purchase Price”), which shall be paid as follows: a) $2,000,000 (which was paid in cash at Closing), b) $1,162,000 to be paid in 15 equal installments, and c) 49,000 of the 100,000 authorized shares of the Merger Sub, such that upon the Closing, 51% of the Merger Sub shall be owned by the Company, and 49% of the Merger Sub shall be owned by the GearBubble Shareholders. We own 51% of GearBubble Tech (See Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail and Form 8-K file with the SEC on July 12, 2021).



The funding for these acquisitions were a combination of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our S-1 Registration Statement and debt.



Aphrodite’s Marketing and GearBubble Tech are expected to increase our online presence and provide for expansion of the Bergio Brand. Aphrodite is a one-stop shop for jewelry, gifts, and surprises for any occasion. The online stores provides for a unique gifting experience in the ecommerce space. With their technological experience in ecommerce, we expect to grow the Bergio Brand, and in conjunction with Bergio’s design expertise and years of experience in the jewelry industry, we believe we can successfully grow the business.



The Company has instituted various cost saving measures to conserve cash and has worked with its debtors in an attempt to negotiate the debt terms. The Company has been also investigating various strategies to increase sales and expand its business. The Company is in negotiations with some potential partners, but, at this time, there is nothing concrete, but the Company remains positive about its prospects. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in its endeavors or that it will be able to increase its business.



Our future operations are contingent upon increasing revenues and raising capital for on-going operations and expansion of our product lines. Because we have a limited operating history, you may have difficulty evaluating our business and future prospects.



Principal Products and Services 



Our products consist of a wide range of unique jewelry styles and designs made from precious metals such as gold, platinum and Karat gold, as well as other precious stones. We continuously innovate and change our designs based upon consumer trends. As a result of new designs being created, we believe we are able to differentiate ourselves from our competition and strengthen our brands. We sell our products to our customers at price points that reflect the market price of the base material as well as design and processing fees.



We believe that we are a trendsetter in jewelry manufacturing. As a result, we come out with a variety of products throughout the year that we believe have commercial potential to meet what we feel are new trends within the industry. The “Bergio” designs consist of upscale jewelry that includes white diamonds, yellow diamonds, pearls, and colored stones, in 18K gold, platinum, and palladium. We currently design and produce approximately 100 to 150 product styles. Current retail prices for our products range from $400 to $200,000.











Our product range is divided into three fashion lines: (i) an 18K gold line, (ii) a bridal line, and (iii) a couture and/or one of kind pieces. Our Chief Executive Officer and director, Mr. Abajian, consults regularly with the design teams to design and create new products and product lines.



Each year, we attempt to expand and/or enhance these lines, while constantly seeking to identify trends that we believe exist in the market for new styles or types of merchandise. Design and innovation are the primary focus of our manufacturing and we are less concerned with the supply and capacity of raw materials. Mr. Abajian with his contacts, which are located mostly overseas, regularly meets to discuss, conceptualize and develop Bergio’s various products and collections. When necessary, additional suppliers and design teams can be brought in as needed. Management intends to maintain a diverse line of jewelry to mitigate concentration of sales and continuously expand our market reach.



Competition and Market Overview



The jewelry design and manufacture industry is extremely competitive and has low barriers to entry. We compete with other jewelry designers and manufacturers of upscale jewelry as well as retail jewelry stores and ecommerce stores. There are over 1,500 jewelry design and manufacture companies worldwide, several of which have greater experience, brand name recognition and financial resources than Bergio, but our vision to create a one Branded stores offering variety of products gives us an advantage over other designers.



Our management believes that the jewelry industry competes in the global marketplace and therefore must be adaptable to remain competitive. Consumer spending for discretionary goods such as jewelry is sensitive to changes in consumer confidence and ultimately consumer confidence is affected by general business considerations in the U.S. economy. Consumer discretionary spending generally declines during times of falling consumer confidence, which may affect the retail sale of our products. U.S. consumer confidence reflected these slowing conditions throughout the last few years.



We believe that a stronger economy, more spending by young professionals with an overall trend toward luxury products will lead to future growth. Therefore, we intend to make strong efforts to maintain our brand in the industry through our focus on the innovation and design of our products as well as being able to consolidate and increase cost efficiency when possible through acquisitions.



Marketing and Distribution



It is our intention to establish Bergio as a holding company for the purpose of establishing retails stores worldwide and increase our online presence.

This is in line with our strategy and belief that a brand name can create an association with innovation, design and quality which helps add value to the individual products as well as facilitate the introduction of new products.



It is our intention to open elegant stores in “high-end” areas and provide excellent service in our stores which will be staffed with knowledgeable professionals and opening online shopping gives us an extreme reach into different markets and support our retail operations.



We also intend to sell our products on a wholesale basis to limited customers.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers



Most of the inventory and raw materials we purchase occurs through our manufacturers located in Europe and U.S. The inventory that we directly maintain is based on recent sales and revenues of our products but ultimately is at the discretion of Mr. Abajian, and his experience in the industry. Our inventories are commodities that can be incorporated into future products or can be sold on the open market. Additionally, we perform physical inventory inspections on a quarterly basis to assess upcoming styling needs and consider the current pricing in metals and stones needed for our products.



We acquire all raw gemstones, precious metals and other raw materials used for manufacturing our products on the open market. We are not constrained in our purchasing by any contracts with any suppliers and acquire raw material based upon, among other things, availability and price on the open wholesale market.



Product for U.S. consumption is now produced in the U.S, and our contracted manufacturer in Italy. Our manufacturing supplier in Italy, who procures the raw materials in accordance with the specifications and designs submitted by Bergio. However, the general supply of precious metals and stones used by us can be reasonably forecast even though the prices will fluctuate. Any price differentials in the precious metals and stones will typically be passed on to the customer.



Most of our precious stones are purchased from various diamond dealers. We do not have any formal agreements with any of our suppliers but have established an ongoing relationship with each of our suppliers.



Intellectual Property



Bergio is a federally registered trademarked name that we own. Since the first trademark of “Bergio” was filed, all advertising, marketing, trade shows and overall presentation of our product to the public has prominently displayed this trademark. As additional lines are designed and added to our products, we may trademark new names to distinguish particular products and jewelry lines.
Research and Development



There were no expenses incurred for research and development in 2021 and 2020.



Employees



As of March 25, 2022, Bergio International, Inc, and subsidiaries had 17 full-time employees and 4 part-time employees. Our current employees are administrative, sales and marketing personnel. No personnel are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We use the services of independent consultants and contractors from time to time when needed.
Environmental Regulation and Compliance



The United States environmental laws do not materially impact our manufacturing as we are using state of the art equipment that complies with all relevant environmental laws.



Approximately 5% of the Company’s manufacturing is contracted to quality suppliers in the vicinity of Valenza, Italy, with the remaining 95% of setting and finishing work being conducted in our Fairfield, New Jersey facility. The setting and finishing work done in our New Jersey facility involves the use of precision lasers, rather than using old soldering procedures which uses gas and oxygen to assemble different elements. Soap and water is used as a standard to clean the jewelry. Also, a standard polishing compound is used for the finishing work, but it does not have a material impact on our cost and effect of compliance with environmental laws.










Government Regulation



Currently, we are subject to all of the government regulations that regulate businesses generally such as compliance with regulatory requirements of federal, state, and local agencies and authorities, including regulations concerning workplace safety, labor relations, and disadvantaged businesses. In addition, our operations are affected by federal and state laws relating to marketing practices in the retail jewelry industry. We are subject to the jurisdiction of federal, various state and other taxing authorities. From time to time, these taxing authorities review or audit our business.
