Our Market Opportunity
 
The craft beer industry offers a value of $94.1 billion in the United States, yet it is still an area of the economy which offers growth potential. As the craft beer market matures, the smaller players are being squeezed out, and the more established breweries are consolidating and gaining market share.
 
In response to this industry trend, BrewBilt is shifting our marketing focus to larger brewing systems that are in higher demand as these successful breweries expand their production volumes with bigger equipment. These targeted customers are less price sensitive than the small startups and more willing to pay top dollar for the quality and reliability that BrewBilt is known for in the craft beer industry.

BrewBilt systems are engineered for high efficiency and consistency, which are critical factors for regional breweries and microbreweries, which make up for 66% and 19% of US craft beer production, respectively.
 
There are five distinct craft beer industry market segments: regional brewers, microbreweries, brewpubs, taprooms, and contract brewers.
 
Essential Craft Beer Industry Statistics
 
As of the writing of this information, 2021 industry numbers have not been released.
 
California had the largest output for the craft beer industry in 2020, offering $9.7 billion in total impact. Pennsylvania finished in second during the year, with a $5.6 billion impact. They were followed by Texas ($5.4 billion), New York ($4.9 billion), and Florida ($3.8 billion). The overall beer market in the United States has a value of $94.1 billion. Although the craft beer segment has a 12.3% share of the total beer volume in the country, it represents 23.6% of the total dollar sales that were achieved in 2020. The dollar sales of craft beer products in the United States was down 22% in 2020, which was a result of pandemic sales being shifted from taprooms to retail for at-home consumption. However, on-site sales are already rebounding strongly in 2022. Adults in the United States consume an average of 19.8 gallons of beer each year, according to the National Beer Wholesalers Association. About 36% of registered breweries in the United States are listed as a brewpub. That means the products they create for consumers are meant for direct sales that occur on their premises. The average brewery with this classification will produce about 1,000 barrels of beer each year. 95% of the breweries which are operating in the United States today produced less than 15,000 barrels of beer each year. That classifies the operation as a microbrewery if 75% or more of the beer the company produces is sold off-site. About 40% of the sales that occur each year for the craft beer industry happen during the months of June, July, or August. Almost 90% of adults over the age of 21 in the United States live within 10 miles of at least one brewery. Most of these operations qualify as a craft beer producer. There are more than 950 different craft breweries operating in California right now, making it the largest source of products for the industry today.
Industry Overview
 
Overall U.S. beer volume sales were down 3% in 2020, while craft brewer volume sales declined 9%, lowering small and independent brewers share of the U.S. beer market by volume to 12.3%.
 
Retail dollar sales of craft decreased 22%, to $22.2 billion, and now account for just under 24% of the $94 billion U.S. beer market (previously $116 billion). The primary reason for the larger dollar sales decline was the shift in beer volume from bars and restaurants to packaged sales.

Competition
 
BrewBilt competes against a number of companies, most of which are selling mass produced equipment from China made from less costly, inferior quality Chinese steel which often is not food grade quality. While this broader market is very competitive, there continues to be little competition and strong market demand for higher quality, custom designed, hand-crafted systems that BrewBilt produces with American labor.
