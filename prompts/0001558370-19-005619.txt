 Item 1.  Business.
 Overview 
 Capstone Turbine Corporation (“Capstone”, “We” or the “Company”) develops, manufactures, markets and services microturbine technology solutions for use in stationary distributed power generation and distribution networks applications, including energy efficient cogeneration combined heat and power (“CHP”), integrated combined heat and power (“ICHP”), and combined cooling, heat and power (“CCHP”), as well as renewable energy, natural resources, and critical power supply applications. Microturbines allow customers to produce power on-site in parallel with the electric grid or stand-alone when no utility grid is available. Several technologies are used to provide “on-site power generation” (also called “distributed generation”) such as reciprocating engines, solar photovoltaic power (“PV”), wind turbines and fuel cells. Our microturbines can be interconnected to other distributed energy resources to form “microgrids” (also called “distribution networks”) located within a specific geographic area and provide power to a group of buildings. For customers who do not have access to the electric utility grid, microturbines provide clean, on site power with fewer scheduled maintenance intervals and greater fuel flexibility than competing technologies. For customers with access to the electric grid, microturbines provide an additional source of continuous on-site power generation, thereby providing additional reliability and potential cost savings compared to the local utility. With our stand alone feature, customers can produce their own energy in the event of a utility power outage and can use microturbines as their primary source of power for extended periods of time unlike traditional diesel standby generator sets. Because our microturbines also produce clean, usable heat energy, they provide economic advantages to customers who can benefit from the use of hot water, chilled water, air conditioning and steam. In addition, our microturbines have been used as battery charging generators for hybrid electric vehicles and to provide power to a vessel’s electrical loads in marine applications. Our microturbines are sold, installed and serviced primarily through our global distribution network. Together with our distributors, we offer new and remanufactured parts as well as a comprehensive Factory Protection Plan (“FPP”) through long-term service agreements ranging from 5 to 20 years.
 We offer microturbines designed for commercial, industrial and onshore and offshore oil and gas applications with product offerings ranging from 30 kilowatts (“kW”) to one megawatt (“MW”) in electric power output, which can be deployed in arrays up to 10 MWs. Our microturbines combine patented air bearing technology, advanced combustion technology and sophisticated power electronics to form efficient and ultra-low emission electricity and cooling and heat production systems. Because of our air bearing technology, our microturbines do not require lube oil, grease, or traditional coolants. This means they do not require routine maintenance to change and dispose of lube oil, grease, or other liquid lubricants, as do the most common reciprocating engines. Our microturbines can be fueled by various sources, including natural gas, propane, butane, sour gas, renewable fuels such as landfill or digester gas, kerosene, diesel and biodiesel. Our microturbines are available with integrated unit mounted heat exchangers, making them easy to engineer and install in applications where hot water, chilled water, air conditioning and steam is desired. 
 We sell microturbine units, components and accessories, as well as offer long-term microturbine rentals. We also remanufacture microturbine engines and provide new and remanufactured aftermarket spares parts, accessories, services, and comprehensive long-term service contracts for up to 20 years. Our microturbines are sold primarily through distributors and Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”). Distributors purchase our products for sale to end users and also provide service, application engineering and installation support. Distributors also provide a variety of additional services, including engineering the applications in which the microturbines will be used, installation support of the products at the end users’ sites, commissioning the installed applications and providing post commissioning service, including a comprehensive FPP. Our distributors perform as independent value added resellers. OEMs integrate our products into their own product solutions.
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Form 10-K”) refers to our fiscal years ending March 31 as its “Fiscal” years.

 Products
 Our 30 kW (“C30”) microturbine can produce enough electricity to power a small convenience store or cathodic protection for an oil or natural gas pipeline. The 65 kW (“C65”) microturbine can produce enough heat to provide hot water to a 100 room hotel while also providing about one third of its electrical requirements. Our 200 kW (“C200”) microturbine is well suited for larger hotels, office, commercial, and industrial buildings and wastewater treatment plants, among others. By packaging the C200 microturbine power modules into single enclosures which are available in multiple sizes and are built in similar dimensions to a standard shipping container or International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) sizes, we have created an upgradable family of microturbine offerings from 600 kW up to 1000 kW or 1 MW in a compact footprint engineered to function as a single source of power. Our 600kW, 800kW and 1000 kW (“C1000S Series”) microturbines are well suited for utility substations, larger commercial and industrial facilities and remote oil and gas applications.
 We began commercial sales of our C30 products in 1998, targeting the emerging distributed generation industry that was being driven by fundamental changes in power requirements. In September 2000, we shipped the first commercial unit of our 60 kW microturbine (“C60”), which was replaced by the C65 model during the quarter ended March 31, 2006. We began shipping the C60 ICHP solution in 2003. Our C60 microturbine was the first combustion power generation product to be certified by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) as meeting its stringent distributed generation emissions standards that went into effect in 2003. The first commercial C200 microturbine was shipped on August 28, 2008. Our C1000 Series product was developed based on our C200 microturbine engine. The C1000 Series product can be configured into 1,000 kW, 800 kW and 600 kW solutions in multiple sizes and are built in similar dimensions to a standard shipping container or ISO sizes, and depending on the configuration, provides the opportunity for future expandability. The first commercial shipment of our C1000 Series product was on December 29, 2008. During Fiscal 2016, we unveiled our C1000 Signature (“C1000S”) microturbine as part of our new C1000S microturbine energy systems which also includes an 800kW (“C800S”) or 600kW (“C600S”) microturbine. The C1000S microturbine incorporates over 70 components, system and design upgrades intended to improve the overall product quality and enhance the microturbine ownership experience in all applications but specifically for CHP and CCHP applications. We began shipping the C200 and C1000 Signature Series ICHP solution in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
 Our microturbines are compact, lightweight and environmentally friendly generators of electricity and heat compared to competing technologies. They operate on the same principle as a jet engine using a variety of commercially available fuels. For example, our microturbines can operate on low British Thermal Unit (“BTU”) gas, which is gas with lower energy content, and can also operate on gas with a high amount of sulfur, known in the industry as sour gas. Examples of these fuel sources include methane from facilities such as wastewater treatment plants, landfills and anaerobic digesters. Our microturbine’s multi fuel capability provides competitive advantages with respect to some of our selected vertical markets. The combustor system remains the same for all fuels except for the fuel injectors, which currently vary between liquid and gaseous fuels.
 Our microturbines incorporate four major design features: advanced combustion technology, patented air bearing technology, digital power electronics and proprietary remote monitoring systems.
 Our advanced combustion technology allows our microturbines to achieve low emissions. Our natural gas fueled C65, C200S and C1000S series microturbines were certified by the CARB as meeting its stringent 2007 emissions requirements—the same emissions standard used to certify fuel cells and the same emissions levels as a central power plant. Our C65 and C200 Landfill and Digester Gas systems were certified by the CARB as meeting its 2008 waste gas emissions requirements for landfill and digester gas applications. These low emission levels not only provide an environmentally friendly product, but also eliminate permitting requirements in several municipalities for continuously operated onsite power generation. 
 The patented air bearing system allows the microturbine’s single moving assembly to produce power without the need for typical petroleum based lubrication. Air bearings use a high pressure field of air rather than petroleum lubricants. This improves reliability and reduces maintenance such as oil changes.

 The digital power electronics manage critical functions and monitor operations of the microturbine; our electronic controls manage the microturbine’s speed, temperature and fuel flow and communication with external networks and building management systems. The digital power electronics coordinate with the grid when the units are operated in a grid connect mode and with the onboard battery when equipped for standalone mode. The digital power electronics also include the functionality of seamless transfer capabilities, ensuring the end-users’ critical loads do not experience any interruption to their operation in the event of a utility power outage. All control functions are performed digitally. Performance is optimized, resulting in low emissions, high reliability and high efficiency over a variable power range. 
 Our proprietary Capstone Remote Monitoring Software (“CRMS”) allows end users to operate and manage the microturbine remotely. This remote capability can provide end users with power generation flexibility and cost savings.
 Our electronic controls manage microturbines using our proprietary software and advanced algorithms. The controls start the turbogenerator and manage its load, coordinate the functioning of the microturbine with the grid, manage the speed, fuel flow and exhaust temperature of the microturbine, convert the variable frequency, up to a maximum of 1,600 Hertz and variable voltage power produced by the generator into a usable output of either 50 or 60 Hertz AC for stationary applications or DC for hybrid electric vehicle applications, and provide digital communications to externally maintain and control the equipment.
 The electrical output of our units can be paralleled in multiple unit configurations through our Advanced Power Server product and a digital communications cable to serve larger installations requiring electrical loads up to ten megawatts. Our products can operate connected to the electric utility grid as a current source, on a standalone basis as a voltage source, multipacked to support larger loads as a “virtual single” unit and in dual mode, where the microturbine operates connected to the electric utility grid or operates independently. 
 We were the first microturbine manufacturer to achieve UL Class I, Division 2 certification and ATEX certification for operation in hazardous area oil and gas applications. These specially packaged systems are applied in oil and gas production areas with potentially explosive environments. Our C65, as well as our C200 and C1000 Signature Series grid connect and stand-alone microturbines are listed by Underwriters Laboratories (“UL”) as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
 Our C30 and C60 microturbines are certified by the California Energy Commission and were the first products to comply with the requirements of its “Rule 21” grid interconnection standard. This standard streamlines the process for connecting distributed generation systems to the grid in California. The benefits of achieving this standard include avoiding both costly external equipment procurement requirements and extensive site by site and utility by utility analysis. Our protective relay functionality has also been recognized by the State of New York, which allows our microturbines to be connected to New York’s electric utility grid.
 We offer various accessories for our products including rotary gas compressors with digital controls, integrated heat recovery modules for CHP applications, dual mode controllers that allow automatic transition between grid connect and stand-alone modes, batteries with digital controls for stand-alone or dual mode operations, power servers for large multipack installations, protocol converters for Internet access, packaging options and miscellaneous parts such as frames, exhaust ducting, backflow dampers and installation hardware. 
 Applications
 Stationary power generation applications can vary greatly depending on load size and demand location. From small 2 kW back-up generators to several large 1,000 MW central generating facilities, stationary power systems can offer superior fuel efficiency for the customer while also meeting strict emissions regulations. Historically, power generation in developed countries such as the United States has been part of a regulated utility system. However, a number of developments related primarily to the deregulation of the utility industry as well as significant technology advances have helped to broaden the range of power supply options available to interested parties.

Our full line of microturbine energy solutions target multiple vertical markets worldwide, including energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply, microgrid and transportation. Within these vertical markets, we focus on applications that we believe have the greatest near term potential for the customer based on various different factors such as energy load demand, available fuels, economic payback and for some, government incentives. We also target smaller sub segments that fall within these vertical markets that may not otherwise be considered for on-site generation.
 Energy Efficiency—CHP/CCHP
 Energy efficiency refers to the proper utilization of both electrical and thermal energies in the power production process. In such applications, our microturbines are able to maximize the availability of usable energy which we believe provides a significant economic advantage to our customers while reducing their onsite emissions. CHP and CCHP can improve site economics by capturing the waste heat created from a single combustion process to increase the efficiency of the total system, from approximately 30 percent to 80 percent or more. Compared with more traditional, independent generation sources, the increase in operational efficiency also reduces greenhouse gas emissions through the displacement of other separate systems, which can also reduce operating costs.
 When compared to onsite boilers, microturbines generally produce fewer commonly found air pollutants (“criteria pollutants”), such as nitrogen oxides (“NOx”), carbon monoxide (“CO”) and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”). In fact, our CHP or CCHP system can displace local boiler emissions altogether. A high efficiency CHP or CCHP system can allow for reduced net utility costs for end users as well as improved fuel consumption. The most common uses for captured thermal energy include space heating and air conditioning, water heating and water chilling, direct-drying and steam for industrial applications. In CCHP applications, the microturbine exhaust drives an absorption chiller, which produces the chilled water necessary for air conditioning and local use. Organizations of all sizes have used the heat generated by our microturbines at the many different types of commercial and industrial applications they serve, including hotels and resorts, hospitals and medical centers, as well as office buildings and large retail facilities.
 Renewable Energy
 There is a growing transition to renewable energy sources and technologies on a global scale. Our microturbines run efficiently on renewable fuels such as methane and other biogases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and renewable natural gas.  They also run efficiently on other small biogas applications like food processing plants, livestock farms and agricultural green waste operations. Microturbines can burn these renewable fuels with minimal emissions, thereby, and in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution while simultaneously producing electricity from this “free” renewable fuel source for use at the site or in the surrounding areas. Our microturbines have demonstrated effectiveness in these smaller applications and may outperform conventional combustion engines in some situations, including when the gas contains a high amount of sulfur, as the sulfur can contaminate combustion engines lube oil leading to equipment breakdowns and higher lifecycle costs.
 We introduced our C65 and C200 stand-alone digester products to the renewable energy market segment in 2007 and 2013, respectively. With these products, we are able to target many different types of renewable energy applications, including biogas producing facilities in third world countries and in remote locations that offer a valuable fuel source for the generation of electricity. The performance of our C65 digester gas system has been routinely evaluated to ensure that the combustion system is stable from 0 to 100 percent power output. Minor controls changes have been implemented to increase stability at low power levels. The ability to convert this low BTU fuel to electricity along with the high reliability and low maintenance features of this product make it well suited for this market. 
 Natural Resources—Crude Oil, Natural Gas, Shale Gas & Mining
 Our microturbines are installed in the natural resource market for use in both onshore and offshore applications, including exploration, production, compression and transmission sites as a highly efficient and reliable source of prime power. In some cases, these oil and gas or mining operations have no electric utility grid and rely solely on power generated onsite. There are numerous locations, on a global scale, where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of oil and gas and other extraction and production processes create fuel byproducts, which are traditionally 

 
  5
 
burned or released into the atmosphere. Our microturbines can turn these fuel byproducts, flare gas or associated gas, into a useable fuel to provide power to these remote oil and gas sites. 
 Major oil and gas companies are exploring large shale reserves, or plays, in the United States. We have been shipping microturbines into the U.S. shale gas market since 2010. The addressable market for our microturbines in this industry is significant. The shale gas market for microturbines may grow as demand for natural gas continues to rise and the U.S. as the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Department of the Interior and other federal and state agencies work to reduce the emission of hazardous air pollutants associated with natural gas development. Our product sales in the natural resources market is driven by our microturbines’ reliability, emissions profile and ease of installation. However, we experienced growth in the oil and gas sector within our natural resources market during Fiscal 2019, which we believe was primarily because oil prices remained above $50.00 per barrel.
 The C30, C65 and C200 microturbines can be configured to meet Class 1 Zone 2 hazardous location requirements for the natural resources market. Hazardous location requirements are met through package ventilation changes for purging and pressurizing package air to avoid potential flammable mixtures as well as controls for emergency disconnect of fuel and electrical sources. The package is upgraded to stainless steel construction to withstand the often corrosive offshore environments where these units are installed. Oil and gas customers often prefer power generation systems that offer low maintenance and high reliability in order to ensure continued production.
 Critical Power Supply
 Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of system failure, momentary or otherwise, certain high demand power users, including high technology, health care and information systems facilities require higher levels of reliability in their power generation service. The majority of microturbine based distributed generation installations have powered through hurricanes with little or no downtime. To meet these customer requirements, traditional solutions utilize Uninterruptible Power Supplies (“UPS”) to protect critical loads from power disturbances along with back-up diesel generators for extended outages. We offer an alternative solution that can both meet customer reliability requirements and reduce operating costs. We have seen continued development in the critical market segment as it relates to heath care facilities.
 We have developed the world’s only microturbine-powered UPS solutions that offer clean, IT grade power and can completely displace the need for traditional UPS and back-up diesel generators. We offer two UL listed microturbine powered UPS solutions: our UPSource microturbine powered solution, which provides a source for prime or emergency power; as well as our Hybrid UPS microturbine-powered solution, which provides power when dispatched in high efficiency, standard UPS and emergency power. Both critical power supply products offer eight nines of availability in an n+1 configuration when the product has at least one independent back-up source. This measurement of availability is used in the data center industry to refer to 99.999999% of reliability. These integrated solutions are well suited for new facility construction or expansion and can be installed with absorption chillers or other heat recovery systems to obtain high efficiency levels while reducing operating costs, compared with traditional solutions and is a developing market segment for us.
 Dual-mode units operating in a prime power configuration can support a 150 percent overload for up to 10 seconds during transient conditions. Dual-mode units operating in grid parallel mode can provide customers a back-up power system with an economic return. These systems offer high on-site energy efficiency when combined with a heat exchanger (CHP) to create hot water, or with a chiller (CCHP) for air conditioning at these facilities. This configuration, when combined with our Dual Mode Controller, can transition from the grid parallel mode to prime power mode in less than 10 seconds. Our microturbines can also be installed along with a rotary UPS to provide a complete line interactive continuous power solution. In this case, the microturbines remain in grid connect mode while the rotary UPS stabilizes the utility voltage and provides a seamless transfer from operation connected to the grid to operation isolated from the grid.

 Microgrid
  Microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources that acts as a single controllable energy entity with respect to the grid. Distributed energy resources typically include other dual-mode microturbines, reciprocating engines, PV, wind turbine, fuel cells and battery storage.  Microgrids can be connected to larger electricity grids; however, in the event of a widespread outage, the microgrid will disconnect from the main grid and continue to operate independently to maintain the electricity supply to the homes and businesses that are connected to the microgrid’s electricity network. Our microturbines have the ability to meet the needs of microgrid end-users by lowering their overall cost to operate and by providing a versatile dispatchable technology that is fuel flexible and scalable enough to fit a wide variety of applications. 

Additionally, we have our own programmable logic control system and sensors, which interface with other building automated systems and these control systems are one of the key aspects of monitoring a microgrid. The use of microgrid to serve local loads helps to reduce energy losses in transmission and distribution, further increasing the efficiency of the microgrid. We have been a part of numerous successful microgrid installations worldwide ranging from a wind turbine manufacturer, ski resort, university, industrial farm, utility software company, brewery and an electrical distribution utility. Capstone microturbines functionality is to ensure energy availability for advanced microgrids before and during disasters, such as hurricanes, they may also help reduce electrical expenditures in the years following a disaster when electric utility rates may be increased to pay for the expenses for grid infrastructure repairs and improvements associated with these disasters. We have seen continued development in the microgrid market segment.
  Transportation
 Our technology also can be used in hybrid electric vehicle (“HEV”) applications. Our customers have applied our products in HEV applications such as transit buses and Class 7 and 8 work trucks. In these applications, the microturbine acts as an onboard battery charger to recharge the battery system as needed. The benefits of microturbine-powered HEV hybrids include extended range, fuel economy gains, quieter operation and reduced emissions when compared with traditional internal combustion engines. Internal combustion diesel engine manufacturers have been challenged for the last several years to develop technology improvements, prior to aftertreatment that reduce emissions to levels specified by the EPA and CARB 2007 and 2010 standards. Many manufacturers are incorporating aftertreatment that increases upfront equipment costs, vehicle weight and life cycle costs, which and may reduce overall engine efficiency.

Additionally, our technology is also used in marine applications. Our customers have applied our products in the commercial vessel and luxury yacht market segments. The application for our marine products is for use as a ship auxiliary generator set. In this application, the microturbines provide power to the vessel’s electrical loads and, in some cases, the vessel is able to utilize the exhaust energy to increase the overall efficiency of the application, reducing overall fuel consumption and emissions. Another feasible application is similar to our HEV application where the vessel is driven by an electric propulsion system and the microturbine serves as an on board battery charger and range extender. Our marine customers use both liquid fueled and natural gas microturbine products. Liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) is in its early stages as a marine fuel, and the number of vessels powered by LNG is forecasted to double every two years over the next decade. Vessel owners can receive the same benefits as users of stationary products: low emissions with no exhaust aftertreatment, long maintenance intervals, high reliability, low noise and no vibration. Transportation is a developing market segment for us. In Fiscal 2019, transportation products were only for customer demonstrations.
 Sales and Marketing 
 We primarily sell and market our microturbine product, parts and service through our global network of authorized distributors, OEMs and national accounts. Our worldwide distribution network was developed from the ground up and has become a valuable asset because we can reach end use customers globally. Each of our distributors is a strategically placed independent partner marketing, selling, and providing applications engineering support for our products on our behalf. In addition, distributors provide remote monitoring services, warranty support, local spare parts support, and customer training and long-term service support. Through our global distribution network, we offer a comprehensive FPP for a fixed fee to perform regularly scheduled and unscheduled maintenance as needed. We provide 

 
  7
 
factory and onsite training to certify all personnel that perform sales, applications, commissioning and long-term service on our microturbines. Individuals who are certified are called Authorized Service Providers, and must be employed by a distributor or an end user in order to perform work pursuant to a FPP. To assure proper application and installation of our microturbine systems, we offer an installer training and an application engineering certification program. We offer to assist all customers by reviewing their installation designs in relation to the technical requirements for proper operation of our products, such as electrical interconnections, load requirements, fuel type and pressure, cooling air flow and turbine exhaust routing. As part of the microturbine commissioning process, we also receive a checklist to confirm that the final installation adheres to our technical requirements before we accept our standard manufacturer warranty obligations. Our typical terms of sale include shipment of the products with title, care, custody and control transferring at our dock, payment terms ranging from full payment in advance of shipment to payment in 90 days, and warranty periods of approximately 15 to 24 months from shipment depending on the product type. We typically do not have customer acceptance provisions in our agreements.
 Effective January 1, 2018, we launched our Distributor Support System (“DSS program”) to provide additional support for distributor business development activities, customer lead generation, brand awareness and tailored marketing services for each of our major geography and market vertical. This new program is funded by our distributors and was developed to provide improved worldwide distributor training, sales efficiency, website development, company branding and provide funding for increased strategic business-to-business marketing activities.

During Fiscal 2016, we launched Capstone Energy Finance, a joint venture that provides financing options for the purchase of our microturbines. Capstone Energy Finance provides end users with the ability to purchase electricity generated by our microturbine at their facility with no upfront capital investment and expand access to clean and reliable onsite energy. A power purchase agreement from Capstone Energy Finance enables organizations to reduce operating expenses by allowing them to buy electricity at a rate that is lower than what they currently pay today. Customers can purchase all or a portion of their energy from Capstone Energy Finance and eliminate exposure to volatile utility rates by locking in a fixed rate for a period of ten to twenty years. Capstone Energy Finance monitors and maintains the system for the entire term of the agreement, and customers pay only for the energy they use. We believe financing solutions offered by Capstone Energy Finance can help new and existing end-users evaluate their purchasing options and provide a solution to immediately improve their bottom line without requiring capital investment in new equipment. The adoption rate of the Capstone Energy Finance solution has been slower than we expected because our customers continue to utilize other financing options or elect to pay directly for our microturbines.
 United States and Canada
 We have distribution agreements with a number of companies throughout North America for the resale of our products. Many of these distributors serve multiple markets in their select geographic regions. The primary markets served in this region have been energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power, microgrid and transportation products. The energy efficiency and natural resources vertical markets are expected to grow as a result of an increased domestic production of hydrocarbons, the low downstream price of natural gas, as well as public and regulatory acceptance of distributed generation.
 In developing our sales opportunities we have identified the need to address various requirements present in our target localities. These requirements include electric grid interconnection standards, gas utility connection requirements, emissions standards, building and fire safety codes and various inspections and approvals. The costs and scheduling ramifications of these various approvals, in conjunction with normal bidding process requirements and construction delays, can be significant to the completion of an installation. Our goal is to work with the applicable regulating entities to establish compliant standards for the installation of our microturbines so that the costs and installation timelines are minimized for our customers. 
 Latin America
 Our target markets in Latin America are energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural resources. Oil and gas production projects continue to be a growing market in Latin America.

 Energy reform in Mexico, for example, has opened new market opportunities for us by allowing competition among multiple players and enabling power generation companies to sell directly to consumers instead of only to the state‑owned Federal Electricity Commission. Our strategy is to leverage our distribution network in Mexico across various market verticals. 
 South America constitutes a diverse group of markets that vary greatly in potential capture for us based on a number of factors, including availability of oil and gas production and transmission, energy pricing and political and investment climate. While we have distributors in nearly all South American countries, our management is focused on what we consider to be the top geographical markets, such as Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Ecuador. 
 Asia and Australia
 Our target markets in Asia and Australia are energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural resources. Our historical sales in Southeast Asia and Australia have primarily been in the energy efficiency and the oil and gas markets. Other areas in Asia and the Pacific Rim offer attractive opportunities as well. China is expected to see growth in the oil and gas market, while biogas recovery is showing signs of growth in Southeast Asia. Middle East and Africa
 Our target market in the Middle East and Africa is primarily oil and gas. This includes flare gas to power projects which are a particularly attractive market opportunity given the volume of gas being flared and the need for stable power in the region. Our management has targeted distributors and customers involved in the capture and use of flare gas in the oil and gas market. However, the geopolitical environment in this region is still volatile, which can have an impact on our sales. Europe and Russia
 To address the European market, including Russia, we are strengthening our relationships with existing and new distributors and have increased local sales and service support. We have an office in Europe for the purpose of working with our local distributors on a daily basis to identify and understand growth opportunities. We have a spare parts distribution center in the United Kingdom to make new and remanufactured parts readily available to our distributors. Europe has a history of extensive use of distributed generation technologies. We continue to diversify the company’s overall presence in Russia and the surrounding Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as we explore new growth opportunities in these areas with multiple new distributors. The rebuilding of our business in Russia and the surrounding CIS area continues to evolve including the addition of our new distributor Turbine International, LLC discussed below. Further, the continuation or escalation of the current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine could continue to negatively impact our operations, sales, and future growth prospects in that region. For more information, see “Risk Factors” beginning on Page 16 of this Form 10‑K. Customers

Under the terms of the Amended Note, TI agreed to pay us $3.8 million over a three-year period in 13 equal quarterly installments starting in December 20, 2019. As of March 31, 2019, the right, title and interest to the accounts receivables owed to us from BPC had not been assigned to TI, as TI had not yet made all payments as required under the Amended Assignment Agreement. The payment of $0.4 million, due March 20, 2019 under the Amended Assignment Agreement, has not been received at the time of this filing.
 We recorded a net bad debt recovery of approximately $0.3 million and $1.1 million during Fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of March 31, 2019, we collected cumulatively approximately $1.8 million from BPC on their previously reserved accounts receivable. Additionally, we collected cumulatively approximately $1.5 million from TI, under the terms of the Assignment Agreement and the Amended Assignment Agreement. The remaining balance of the fully reserved accounts receivable was $4.8 million as of March 31, 2019. 
 Competition
 The market for our products is highly competitive. Our microturbines compete with existing technologies such as reciprocating engines and compete with emerging distributed generation technologies, including solar-powered systems, wind‑powered systems, fuel cells and other microturbines. Many potential customers rely on the utility grid for their electrical power. Many of our distributed generation competitors are large, well‑established companies that derive competitive advantages from production economies of scale, worldwide presence, brand recognition and greater resources which they can devote to product development or promotion.
 Often power purchased from the electric utility grid can be less costly than power produced by distributed generation technologies. Utilities may also charge fees to interconnect to their power grids. However, we can provide economic benefits to end users in instances where the waste heat from our microturbine has value (CHP and CCHP), where fuel costs are low (renewable energy/renewable fuels), where the costs of connecting to the grid may be high or impractical (such as remote power applications), where reliability and power quality are of critical importance, or in situations where peak shaving could be economically advantageous because of highly variable electricity prices. Because our microturbines can provide a reliable source of power and can operate on multiple fuel sources, our management believes we offer a level of flexibility not currently offered by other technologies such as reciprocating engines.
 Our reciprocating engine competitors have products and markets that are well developed and technologies that have been proven for some time. A reciprocating engine, also known as an internal combustion engine, is similar to those used in automotive applications. Reciprocating engines are popular for primary and back-up power applications despite higher levels of emissions, noise and maintenance. These technologies, which in many cases have a lower up front cost than microturbines, are currently produced by Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Inc. (which recently entered into a joint venture with Eaton), Innio who recently bought the General Electric Gas Engine business, which now includes 

 
  10
 
Waukesha and Jenbacher gas engines, MAN SE, and Tecogen, Inc. (which now includes American DG Energy Inc.), among others.
 Our microturbines may also compete with other distributed generation technologies, including solar-powered systems, wind-powered systems, fuel cells and fly wheel. Solar and wind powered systems produce no emissions and benefit from above market contracts provided by state mandates. The main drawbacks to solar and wind powered systems is that they may not be dispatchable because of their dependence on weather conditions, the utility grid or high capital costs that can often make these systems uneconomical without government subsidies depending upon geographic locale and application of the technology. Although the market is still developing, a number of fuel cell providers are also focused on markets similar to ours, including Active Power Inc. (a division of Piller Power Systems Inc.), Ballard Power Systems Inc., Bloom Energy Corporation, FuelCell Energy Inc., LG Fuel Cell Systems, a business unit of LG Electronics, and Plug Power Inc. Fuel cells have slightly lower levels of NOx, CO, VOCs and other criteria pollutant emissions than our microturbines. With higher government incentives, microturbines would provide a better economic value to end users in most applications. 
 We also compete with other companies who have microturbine products, including FlexEnergy and Turbec S.p.A.
 Overall, we compete with end users’ other options for electrical power and heat generation on the basis of our microturbine’s ability to:

· | provide power when a utility grid is not available or goes out of service;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reduce total cost of purchasing electricity and fuel;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | improve electric power availability and provide high power quality;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | operate on multiple fuel types;
--+--------------------------------


· | reduce emissions (both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | simplify operation; and
--+------------------------


· | control maintenance costs and associated disposal of hazardous materials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Governmental and Regulatory Impact
 Our markets can be positively or negatively impacted by the effects of governmental and regulatory matters. We are affected not only by energy policy, laws, regulations and incentives of governments in the markets in which we sell, but also by rules, regulations and costs imposed by utilities. Utility companies or governmental entities may place barriers on the installation or interconnection of our product with the electric grid. Further, utility companies may charge additional fees to customers who install on‑site power generation; thereby reducing the electricity they take from the utility, or for having the capacity to use power from the grid for back‑up or standby purposes. These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our product, or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems. This could make our systems less economical, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations. These costs, incentives and rules are not always the same as those faced by technologies with which we compete. However, rules, regulations, laws and incentives could also provide an advantage to our distributed generation solutions as compared with competing technologies if we are able to achieve required compliance in a lower cost, more efficient manner. Additionally, reduced emissions and higher fuel efficiency could help our customers combat the effects of climate change. Accordingly, we may benefit from increased government regulations that impose tighter emission standards particularly on burning coal and fuel oil and fuel efficiency as long as gas combustion technology solutions are not excluded.

 Government funding can impact the rate of development of new technologies or improvements to existing technologies. We continue to engage with federal and state policymakers to support government programs that promote the deployment of our low emission and energy efficient products. Competing new technologies have historically received larger incentives and development funding than do microturbines. However, the U.S. Department of Energy is funding research to explore the role CHP could play as a flexible resource to provide additional generating capacity when the grid demands increase and/or to provide other services, such as frequency regulation for stabilization. As more intermittent renewable resources are added to the electric grid, grid operators need access to additional dispatchable generation capacity to ensure an adequate and stable power supply. Capstone’s new PowerSync controller could provide this automated response capability to allow for participation in grid services markets, where permitted.
 In the United States, a 10% Federal Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) for CHP and microturbines is available through the end of 2021. In addition, bonus depreciation rules allow businesses to immediately deduct 100% of eligible property placed in service after September 27, 2017 and before January 1, 2023. The deduction limit will phase down from 100% to 0% by 2027. As a result, we may see a positive impact on our sales in the United States due to the availability of this 10% tax credit and bonus depreciation. However, other CHP and gas-powered distributed energy technology-providers will also benefit from the return of these tax incentives, and, fuel cell technologies will receive a 30% ITC level with a phase down to 22% by 2022 and expiration in 2023. At the state level, slow approvals for natural gas pipeline infrastructure may impact gas availability in some areas, and efforts to incentivize building electrification over natural gas-fueled heat and power sources may inhibit sales. However, electricity demand spikes may also lead to higher electricity prices thereby improving project economics for on-site distributed power generation. 
 In global markets, European governments continue to support efficient CHP and are beginning to take action on reducing local air pollution through regulations like the EU’s Medium Combustion Plant and EcoDesign Directives. Our low emission systems’ ability to meet these programs’ requirements may have a positive impact on our sales as implementation progresses. In the oil and gas market, many producers have committed to reduce methane emissions from their operations. Our low maintenance, reliable systems and our ability to run on a range of fuels could fit their needs and result in a positive impact on our sales. 
 Sourcing and Manufacturing
 We are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization. Our manufacturing designs include the use of conventional technology, which has been proven in high volume automotive and turbocharger production for many years. Many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off the shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications that require longer lead time. We believe that in most cases, adequate capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time. However, single source suppliers with long lead times may be more challenging to transition to another supplier. We have an ongoing program to develop alternative back up suppliers for sole source parts wherever possible, however this has been challenging with low production volumes and increased pricing. We regularly reassess the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our future needs. We continue to evaluate and implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability, service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs. 
 During Fiscal 2019, we identified a defect in one of the component parts for microturbine systems from one of our single source suppliers. As a result of this defect we have identified several new suppliers with greater engineering expertise and robust quality management systems. The transition is complex, lengthy and may result in an interruption in our manufacturing process.  An interruption in our manufacturing process for this component part would adversely impact our results of operations. The efforts to qualify and dual source these components was completed in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019.
 During Fiscal 2018, we received notification from one of our single source suppliers that they were at maximum capacity and would require prepayment and a significant increase in the price of multiple components in order to fulfill our supply requirements for Fiscal 2019. Due to their capacity issues, it is uncertain if we will experience an interruption in parts from this supplier or be able to fully offset or recover any resulting component price increases. 

 
  12
 
During Fiscal 2019, we issued a prepayment of approximately $2.2 million to this single source supplier. A new supplier has been identified and has been fully qualified and is now working towards increasing its capacity and is expected to meet our production volumes during Fiscal 2020.
 We have substantially increased our focus on process controls and validations, supplier controls, distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality. In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify cost improvement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectiveness and use lean manufacturing processes. Our ability to leverage these capabilities may be affected by the current variability in our demand volumes and forecasting. Our demand volumes and forecasting could continue to be negatively impacted by the volatility of the global oil and gas markets, a strong U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas), tariffs and/or import taxes, and ongoing global geopolitical tensions. Our strategy is to identify primary and secondary sources for critical components, both domestic and international, for when available to minimize production line down time due to unavailability of such parts, which could affect our ability to meet manufacturing schedules on build or a linear basis. In April 2019, we executed multiple new Long Term Agreements (“LTA”) including a new 10-year LTA with a new supplier. The LTA from the new supplier will initially reduce annual direct material costs an estimated $2 million per year once the transition is completed. The strategy to reduce direct material costs is based on partnering with our supply base to drive collaborative cost improvements within its value chain which will enable the significant material cost reductions.
 Solar Turbines Incorporated (“Solar”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc., was our sole supplier of recuperator cores prior to 2001. In 2000, we exercised an option to license Solar’s technology, which allows us to manufacture these cores ourselves and we began manufacturing them in June 2001. We are required to pay a per unit royalty fee for the life of Capstone’s patents for cores manufactured and sold by us using the technology. Royalties of approximately $33,200 and $30,900 were earned by Solar for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 In 2007, we entered into a Development and License Agreement (“Development Agreement”) with Carrier Corporation (“Carrier”) regarding the payment of royalties on the sale of each of our C200 microturbines. On July 25, 2018, we and Carrier entered into a Second Amendment whereby we agreed to pay Carrier approximately $3.0 million to conclude our current royalty obligation under the Development Agreement and release us from any future royalty payment obligations. The Second Amendment also removed non-compete provisions from the Development Agreement, allowing us to design, market or sell our C200 System in conjunction with any energy system and compete with Carrier products in the CCHP market. On September 19, 2018, we paid in full the negotiated royalty settlement agreement of $3.0 million to Carrier, as such there is no further royalty obligation to Carrier. Carrier earned $0.4 million and $0.9 million in royalties for C200 and C1000 Series system sales during each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. 
 During the third quarter of Fiscal 2018, we consolidated our operations and offices into our Van Nuys location in Southern California. We have an approximately 42,300 square foot manufacturing footprint running on a single shift. We believe that our production capacity goal of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix is well above our current production rates and will be achievable by adding additional shifts. This may require an increase in working capital and some additional capital expenditures when necessary.
 Research and Development (“R&D”)
 Our engineering mission has been on supporting the expansion of our existing suite of products, focusing on alternative fuels and technologies, maintaining relevance in the global evolution of grid interconnection requirements, and the launch of the PowerSync Controller. We focus our engineering efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a cost-effective and timely manner. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, R&D expenses were $3.6 million and $4.0 million, respectively, which amounts are equivalent to 4% and 5% of total revenue, respectively, for these fiscal years.

 Our product development activities during Fiscal 2019 continued with the launch of the new family of PowerSync controllers used for Capstone microturbines. We also continued development and testing of a new self-cleanable severe environment air filtration system for our Signature Series line of microturbine products. Capstone has also embarked upon a project to modernize control electronics, providing common functionality, minimizing near term obsolescence concerns, and enabling long term support. 
 Phoenix Contact and Capstone partnered in a joint effort to improve on-site controls and integration with end-use customer facilities. The main objectives of developing the new PowerSync controller line were to further increase system reliability, availability and make Capstone microturbines easier to use for both end-user customers as well as Capstone distribution partners.  Fiscal 2019 marked the first substantial integration of the PowerSync at a number of customer sites.  From these integration and commissioning activities, Capstone and Phoenix Contact took feedback to make further improvements to software and hardware. The goal of such improvements is to make the whole process easier and more straightforward.
 Our new self-cleanable severe environment air filtration system for our line of Signature Series microturbine products was launched during Fiscal 2019. During sand and dust storms common to most hot arid desert areas, particulate concentrations close to the ground can reach levels 20,000 times those in typical U.S. cities. Such dust and dirt loads can cripple conventional air filtration systems, cause massive maintenance expenditures and allow excessive dust concentrations to be ingested by the turbine. Capstone’s new cleanable severe environment units employ industry standard high-efficiency filters. The systems will feature self-cleanable pulse actuation to extend life and service interval, critical for remote sites.
 In Fiscal 2019, Capstone was issued two patents related to fuel injection and emissions. The first patent issued is for a multi-staged lean pre-vaporizing, pre-mixing fuel injector providing ultra-low emissions that meet EPA Tier 4 requirements for power generation. Under this new program, exhaust emissions from these engines will be required to decrease by more than 90%.   The second patent is for a multiple-fuel capable, pre-mixed, low emission injector for high flame speed fuel combustion.  This patent is the foundation for continued development in achieving high reliability and performance with hydrogen content fuels.
 Our C65, C200 and C1000 Series microturbines became UL 1741 Supplement A (SA) certified during Fiscal 2019. This testing standard was written in response to California Rule 21, and in response to the local increased presence of distributed generation and require interactive grid support functions.  Capstone benefitted substantially from previous certification successes for the German and Italian markets to expedite conformance to UL 1741 SA.  Certification standards are becoming increasingly commonplace globally, with localization of controls and requirements.
 Our partnership with the DOE provided funding during Fiscal 2017 in the amount of $335,000 for one year to Argonne National Laboratory to conduct hydrogen and synthetic fuel or syngas testing on our C65 and C200 microturbines. Hydrogen testing was on hold while the test facility implemented mechanisms for safe handling, detection, and delivery of the hydrogen gas.  Despite a challenging federal budgetary environment, funding has been extended to the 2019 government fiscal year for completion of the testing.
 We partnered with FGC Plasma Solutions to test a new plasma-assisted fuel injection technology in our C65 microturbine. We worked together to develop a new combustion concept for improved turbine efficiency and emissions performance. The technology will enable more optimum operation of the engine as well as benefits from lower emissions, increased fuel flexibility and improved reliability. Testing will commence in Fiscal 2020 and will be held at Argonne National Laboratory.
 Capstone and Argonne National Laboratory are also partnering on a microturbine derivative utilizing Argonne’s high-efficiency, fast-charging, and fast discharging Thermal Energy Storage System.  This effort is funded through the Department of Energy’s Technology Commercialization Fund.  The thermal storage system is expected to improve the microturbine’s overall efficiency increasing value to the customer.  Integration and demonstration of the technology will take place at the end of Fiscal 2020.

 In Fiscal 2020, as part of an ARPA-E award, Capstone Turbine will work with Washington State University to develop and demonstrate a solid oxide fuel cell based hybrid power system utilizing Capstone’s proven and reliable microturbine.   The new hybrid power system would bridge the natural gas powered industry today with the energy systems of the future.
 In addition, we continue to work both cost reduction and performance enhancement activities to improve the value of our microturbine products for our customer base. Cost reduction activities are focused on leveraging the capabilities of our supply base and internal design lean manufacturing improvements. Product enhancements are focused on reducing the already very low maintenance requirements for our products, while at the same time improving operational efficiency, thereby reducing our customers’ total cost of ownership. 
 Because of our single moving assembly, manufacturers believe there is also the opportunity to produce a lower cost product in larger automotive volumes. Our focus is on a next generation product that would include existing components and a liquid cooled set of electronics that are consistent with the size, cost and cooling strategies employed on vehicles today. Although we believe the hybrid electric bus and truck market has the potential to be a beneficial option for the bus and truck manufacturers, we temporarily suspended our development efforts with respect to C30 microturbines targeted at this market in response to our lower revenue. Management intends to continue with the next phase of development after we achieve profitability.
 We are working with the Kenworth Truck Company to demonstrate a Class 7 series hybrid delivery truck with funding support from the South Coast Air Quality Management District and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. The Kenworth Class 7 hybrid truck is retrofitted with a refrigerated box body, and a 65kW Capstone microturbine operating on CNG.  Emissions and fuel economy testing was completed at UC Riverside in 2018, including comparison testing of a similarly equipped traditional diesel truck. Results for the three tested drive cycles indicate the hybrid truck can provide 50 to 68% reduction in tailpipe NOx emissions, 19 to 27% reduction in overall CO2 emissions, and 26 to 32% reduction in operating cost.  The next step is to operate the truck on actual customer delivery routes in both air districts to quantify the performance, emissions, fuel economy, and other benefits of a microturbine based hybrid solution. We expect to collect and utilize information from the Kenworth Class 7 hybrid truck’s road testing and demonstration processes for future product developments and enhancements. A prototype or concept vehicle such as this may take several years to go into commercial production following completion of rigorous testing. 
 Our liquid fuel microturbines have demonstrated emissions levels which meet the CARB 2010 standards for Heavy Duty Diesel Engines (“HDDE”). The liquid fuel microturbine is able to meet these extremely low emissions requirements using its lean premix combustion technology with no exhaust aftertreatment. Competitive reciprocating engine technologies require aftertreatment components that increase system cost, require frequent maintenance, and impact engine efficiency. Our compressed natural gas (“CNG”) fueled microturbines also meet extremely low emission standards, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and CARB 2010 emissions requirements for On Road HDDE for Urban Bus. Test emissions from our natural gas microturbines measured dramatically less than the emissions levels set forth by the CARB standard including NOx at 75% and CO at 96% less than the required levels. 
 Our marine products have been used to provide hybrid electric marine propulsion, “hotel power,” CHP, or CCHP. They may be ideal for small and mid-size commercial ships that travel inland waterways and emissions controlled areas (“ECAs”). Although we believe the marine sector has the potential to be a beneficial option for the vessel owners, we temporarily suspended our development efforts with respect to C30 microturbines targeted at this market in response to our lower revenue. We currently intend to continue with the next phase of development after we achieve profitability. 
 Our C65 Hybrid UPS product line has been evolving over the years. After having received the 2011 NOVA Award from the Construction Innovation Forum for the C65 Hybrid UPS Microturbine at Syracuse University’s data center—labeled one of the greenest data centers in the world, our C65 Hybrid UPS system has continued development and has installations at Sempra in Monterey Park, California and our own data center in Van Nuys, California as well as two Department of Homeland Security installations, among several others. The product utilizes our inverter electronics and controls technology to provide continuous power quality to meet the customer’s critical load. The load inverter is connected through a central power bus to provide power from one of three available power sources including the utility 

 
  15
 
grid, battery storage system, or microturbine generator. Power to the critical load is synchronized to an available utility grid to allow direct bypass of the critical load to the utility grid. This redundant functionality is provided in a single integrated package that can be scaled to a larger seamless power unit through our multipack feature. These units can also be combined with a heat recovery module or an absorption chiller to provide higher total output efficiency. Unlike current UPS products combined with reciprocating engines for backup, our low emissions Hybrid UPS product allows for continuous operation year-round allowing customers the ability to receive a payback on their capital equipment investment. Although we believe the industrial UPS market has the potential to be a beneficial option for businesses that require constant supply of reliable energy, we temporarily suspended our development efforts with respect to C65 microturbines targeted at this market in response to our lower revenue. We currently intend to continue with the next phase of development after we achieve profitability.
 Protecting our Intellectual Property Rights and Patents
 We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, “know how”, and trademark laws and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our products. In this regard, we have obtained 58 U.S. and 4 international patents (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions). The patents we have obtained will expire between calendar years 2019 and 2037. We actively evaluate our patent portfolio and pursue new patent applications as we develop new technological innovations, as needed.
 We believe that a policy of protecting intellectual property is one component of our strategy of being the leader in microturbine system technology and will provide us with a long term competitive advantage. In addition, we implement security procedures at our plants and facilities and have confidentiality agreements with our suppliers, distributors, employees and certain visitors to our facilities.
 Organization and Employees
 We were organized in 1988 in the State of California. Our company was reincorporated as Capstone Turbine Corporation on June 22, 2000 in the State of Delaware.
 As of March 31, 2019, we had 153 full-time employees and one part time employee. No employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements. We consider relations with our employees to be good. Available Information
