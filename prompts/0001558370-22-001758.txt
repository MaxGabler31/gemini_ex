Item 1. Business.
Overview
Tactile Systems Technology, Inc. (“we,” “us,” and “our”) is a medical technology company that develops and provides innovative medical devices for the treatment of underserved chronic diseases. We were originally incorporated in Minnesota under the name Tactile Systems Technology, Inc. on January 30, 1995. During 2006, we established a merger corporation and subsequently, on July 21, 2006, merged with and into this merger corporation resulting in us being reincorporated as a Delaware corporation. The resulting corporation assumed the name Tactile Systems Technology, Inc. and in September 2013, we began doing business as “Tactile Medical”. Our mission is to help people suffering from chronic diseases live better and care for themselves at home. We focus our efforts on advancing the standard of care in treating underserved chronic diseases in the home to improve patient outcomes and quality of life and help control rising healthcare expenditures. Our areas of therapeutic focus are (1) vascular disease, with a goal of advancing the standard of care in treating lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency, (2) oncology, where lymphedema is a common consequence among cancer survivors and (3) providing airway clearance therapy for those suffering from chronic respiratory conditions. We possess a unique, scalable platform to deliver at-home healthcare solutions throughout the United States. This evolving home care delivery model is recognized by policymakers and insurance payers as a key for controlling rising healthcare costs. Our solutions deliver cost-effective, clinically proven, long-term treatment for people with these chronic diseases.
We employ a direct-to-patient and -provider model within our lymphedema portfolio, through which we obtain patient referrals from clinicians, manage insurance claims on behalf of our patients and their clinicians, deliver our solutions directly to patients and train them on the proper use of our solutions. This model allows us to engage directly with patients and clinicians, which are both critical audiences to which we can provide clinical evidence and education. For our respiratory therapy products, we have a durable medical equipment (“DME”) distribution model, utilizing mature comprehensive respiratory DME providers to service patients. We sell the AffloVest product to accredited DME providers. They gather and submit documentation for payer reimbursement, train patients on use of the device, and provide ongoing patient support. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated revenue of $208.1 million and had a net loss of $11.8 million. Our revenue increased 11% during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Lymphedema is a type of chronic swelling, or edema, which occurs in the arms, legs, neck, trunk or other body parts when the lymphatic vessels are unable to adequately drain protein-rich lymph fluid from these regions. Lymphedema is progressive in nature, worsens over time, and has no known cure. Chronic venous insufficiency is a condition that occurs when the venous wall and/or valves in the veins are not working effectively, making it difficult for blood to return to the heart from the affected region(s). Phlebolymphedema is the convergence of lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency. When the venous system does not effectively transfer blood from the lower limbs, it can result in venous hypertension and the development of painful, slow-healing wounds on the lower leg called venous leg ulcers. Venous hypertension can also lead to a marked increase in fluid build-up in the limbs, overwhelming the lymphatic system and causing lymphedema. Our proprietary Flexitouch and Entre systems are clinically proven at-home solutions for patients with vascular disorders such as lymphedema. Patients with lymphedema or chronic venous insufficiency are typically treated by vascular surgeons, vascular medicine physicians, oncology care teams, wound physicians, nurses and therapists. 
Our advanced Flexitouch system provides effective automated, at-home lymphatic drainage therapy. Its patented, curved chambers stimulate the lymphatic system to remove excess fluid and reduce swelling. The pneumatic chambers sequentially inflate and deflate for only a few seconds each, creating a gentle wave-like application of pressure to stimulate the movement of lymphatic fluid and direct it towards properly functioning areas of the body. Peer-reviewed, published studies have shown that our Flexitouch system provides improved patient quality of life and clinical outcomes, and delivers significant cost savings to payers and patients. The first generation of our Flexitouch system received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, in July 2002 and our second-generation Flexitouch system received 510(k) clearance from the FDA in October 2006. In September 2016, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the Flexitouch system in 

5




treating lymphedema in the head and neck. In June 2017, we announced that we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the Flexitouch Plus, the third-generation version of our Flexitouch system. In December 2020, we received 510(k) clearance for two new indications for our Flexitouch Plus system: phlebolymphedema and lipedema. Our Flexitouch system generated $176.2 million, or 85%, of our revenue in 2021, and $163.9 million, or 88%, of our revenue in 2020. 
The Entre system is marketed to patients for whom a basic pump is suitable or who do not yet qualify for insurance reimbursement for an advanced compression device such as our Flexitouch system. Our Entre system generated $26.7 million, or 13%, of our revenue in 2021, and $23.2 million, or 12%, of our revenue in 2020.
On September 8, 2021, we acquired the assets of the AffloVest respiratory therapy product line from International Biophysics Corporation (“IBC”), a privately-held company which developed and manufactures AffloVest. AffloVest is a portable, battery-powered wearable vest, that treats patients with chronic respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”)-associated breathing conditions like bronchiectasis, or conditions resulting from neuromuscular disorders and cystic fibrosis, by managing airway clearance. Since patients with chronic pulmonary conditions typically require a host of comprehensive respiratory solutions, such as oxygen, nebulizers and non-invasive ventilation, we use respiratory DME providers as our method of distribution. These respiratory DME providers provide a full range of solutions for these patients with complex diseases, and represent a large, developed channel. The AffloVest product line generated $5.1 million, or 2%, of our total revenue from September 9, 2021 through December 31, 2021.
To support the growth of our business, we invest in our commercial infrastructure, consisting of our direct sales force, DME sales team, patient training resources, reimbursement capabilities and clinical expertise. We are a national, accredited provider of home medical equipment services approved for coverage by private payers, Medicare, the Veterans Administration and certain Medicaid programs in the United States. Our field commercial team is focused on increasing clinician awareness of our lymphedema solutions. As of December 31, 2021, this team consists of approximately 220 field sales representatives, 30 field managers and 94 Field Support Specialists. The AffloVest device is sold through DME providers throughout the United States, supported by a team of 11 sales representatives.
 In concert with COVID-19 social distancing requirements and recommendations, beginning in 2020, our patient training model includes both in-person training and virtual patient training options. This provides additional options for us to connect with patients to ensure they receive the appropriate training, while protecting the health and limiting the exposure of both our trainers and patients. In 2021, patient training was primarily provided by a team of employee trainers, in addition to a small number of independent healthcare practitioners that act in the same capacity as employee trainers to educate patients on the proper use of our solutions.
Our reimbursement function includes payer relations and reimbursement operations. Our payer relations function focuses on payer policy development, education, contract negotiations, and data analysis. Our reimbursement operations function is responsible for verifying patient insurance benefits, individual patient case development, prior authorization submissions, case follow-up, and appeals when necessary. Our clinical function, consisting of a scientific advisory board, in-house therapists and nurses, and our Chief Medical Officer, serves as a resource to clinicians and patients and guides our development of clinical evidence in support of our products. We believe these investments are critical to driving payer, clinician and patient adoption of our technologies, and together with our commercial infrastructure, represent a significant competitive advantage. 
Health insurance coverage for our Flexitouch and Entre systems is in place with private payers, Medicare, the Veterans Administration and certain Medicaid programs. Based on our estimates, we are contracted or enrolled as an in-network provider with payers covering nearly 275 million lives in the United States. Over 245,000 patients have been treated with our Flexitouch system since its launch in 2004, and approximately 45,000 Flexitouch systems were shipped in 2021. More than 77,000 patients have been treated with our Entre system since its launch in 2013, and approximately 20,000 Entre systems were shipped in 2021.

AffloVest also benefits from a relatively mature reimbursement landscape. Health insurance coverage is in place for High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (“HFCWO”) vest therapy with Medicare and most private insurers. Respiratory DME partners serve the role of receiving prescriptions, verifying coverage criteria, shipping, billing and training the patient.
Coronavirus (COVID-19)
The United States economy in general and our business specifically have been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have seen adverse impacts as it relates to the decline in the number of patients that healthcare facilities and clinics are able to treat due to enhanced safety protocols. While we saw some level of recovery in the second quarter of 2021, the second half of 2021 was negatively impacted by the prolonged recovery from COVID-19 and increased variant cases during the period, which extended and expanded restricted access to clinics and hospitals and disrupted the recovery in patient visits versus the pre-COVID environment. There are no reliable estimates of how long the pandemic will last, whether any recovery will be sustained or will reverse course, the severity of any resurgence of COVID-19 or variant strains of the virus, the effectiveness of vaccines and attitudes towards receiving them, or what ultimate effects the pandemic will have. For that reason, we are unable to reasonably estimate the long-term impact of the pandemic on our business at this time. 
Since the onset of COVID-19, we have remained proactive to ensure we continue to adapt to the needs of our employees, clinicians and patients. For a detailed listing of the changes to our business practices since the onset of the pandemic, refer to previous reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Continued modifications to our business include, but are not limited to:

● | Incorporating remote and flexible work arrangements for employees whenever possible, including real-time, online training of our new sales representatives. In addition, we are monitoring pandemic conditions to assess whether our in-office and remote work strategy remains both productive and competitive.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Eliminating employee travel restrictions in alignment with the opening of healthcare facilities and clinics while also continuing to maintain social distancing contact restrictions to reduce exposure.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Utilizing employee trainers and a small number of independent healthcare practitioners to educate patients on the proper use of our solutions virtually or in-person.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continuing to host large virtual medical education programs, while also beginning to schedule smaller in-person meetings and restoring attendance at key professional congresses.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Supporting clinicians and patients by using rigorous infection control practices when in-person visits are required.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Following government guidelines related to vaccinations of our staff in light of customer vaccination requirements and our focus on safe interactions with patients and customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We cannot assure you that these changes to our processes and practices will be successful in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on our business. We continue to evaluate and, if appropriate, will adopt other measures in the future related to the ongoing safety of our employees, clinicians and patients. Additional information related to the COVID-19 pandemic is included elsewhere in this report.

Overview of Lymphedema and Chronic Venous Insufficiency 
Lymphedema
The lymphatic system, a fundamental part of the cardiovascular system, consists of lymph vessels and lymph organs that protect the body against harmful bacteria and transport lymph fluid from the body’s tissues

back to the cardiovascular system. Lymph vessels are thin-walled capillaries that absorb fluids, bacteria and proteins, and propel them to lymph nodes, small lymph organs that filter and process the lymph fluid by eliminating waste and bacteria. Lymph nodes are located in several areas of the body, including superficial and deep lymph nodes under each arm, at the hip, in the groin, above the collar bones in the neck, in the abdomen, tonsils and spleen, and in bone marrow. Lymph vessels and lymph nodes work together with larger lymph structures to help maintain a normal healthy fluid balance.
Lymphedema occurs when there is impairment to the lymphatic system, disrupting normal transport of lymph fluid within the body and causes severe and debilitating symptoms, including swelling, decreased mobility, skin breakdown, pain, increased risk of serious infection and marked psychosocial impairment, resulting in significant negative implications for a patient's health. When the lymphatic system becomes overwhelmed, damaged, or blocked for an extended period of time, lasting swelling (referred to as chronic edema) occurs. Symptoms related to lymphedema can present anywhere in the body, including the head, neck, arms, legs, trunk and genitals. For most patients with lymphedema, it has a negative impact on their quality of life. Performing daily activities of cooking, shopping, cleaning and yard work can often become difficult, if not impossible, for patients who suffer from lymphedema. For patients with head and neck lymphedema, critical functions such as swallowing, breathing and range of motion can be negatively impacted. Over time, the accumulation of lymph fluid can result in significant changes in the structure of the tissues, causing thickening and hardening of the skin, referred to as fibrosis. Recurrent skin infections such as erysipelas and cellulitis, a more serious skin infection, are common complications of lymphedema.
Lymphedema worsens over time if not properly treated, and currently has no known cure. When untreated, lymphedema can become painful and debilitating. The symptoms of lymphedema can be managed however, and patients who are educated about effective treatment options can improve their quality of life.
Misdiagnosis of lymphedema is common, and often patients do not get the medical care they need until significant symptoms have occurred. Proper diagnosis of lymphedema may require evaluation by a physician or other healthcare provider with knowledge of lymphedema and its visible symptoms. While not required to develop a lymphedema diagnosis, some clinicians may choose to perform diagnostic testing. Diagnostic tests for lymphedema include history and physical examination, soft tissue and vascular imaging, lymph node imaging, volume measurements, changes in electrical conductance, changes in biomechanical properties, genetic testing and blood tests for other conditions that have similar symptoms to lymphedema. The International Society of Lymphology categorizes the progression of lymphedema from Stage 0, the least severe stage, to Stage 3, the most severe stage. 
 Chronic Venous Insufficiency and Phlebolymphedema 
The most common form of lymphedema in the Western world is phelobolymphedema, a mixed etiology swelling due to chronic venous insufficiency (“CVI”) and lymphatic insufficiency. The inability of the lymphatic system to adequately drain the interstitial fluid that accumulates in severe chronic venous hypertension causes this ‘combined’ condition, phlebolymphedema. CVI is prevalent among patients who are obese or pregnant and may also be caused by high blood pressure, trauma, lack of exercise, smoking, deep vein thrombosis and inflammation of the vein walls. As the valves deteriorate, blood is no longer able to effectively travel in the normal direction, leading to increased pressure in the vascular system, stretching and dilating vessels, which exacerbates the problem. Prolonged or untreated chronic venous insufficiency may cause an increase in the buildup of interstitial fluid (the fluid surrounding cells), which in turn, can cause skin and tissue changes that can permanently damage the lymphatic system. As hypertension increases, more fluid is pushed out of the vascular system leading to swelling, progressive tissue breakdown, skin infections and venous leg ulcers. Ulcers develop in areas with edema as swelling interferes with the movement of oxygen and nutrients through tissues, and if left untreated, these ulcers can quickly become infected or even gangrenous. Physicians diagnose chronic venous insufficiency based on appearance, symptoms and imaging techniques and classify it based upon a scale endorsed by the Society for Vascular Surgery. 
Market Opportunity 
Lymphedema and CVI are costly and lifelong conditions with debilitating physical and psychological impacts on patients. Based on a study performed by Dr. Steven Dean et al., it is estimated that more than 16 

8




million people in the United States are living with lymphedema due to CVI. This, in addition to the estimated five million individuals living in the U.S with cancer-related and primary lymphedema, increases the prevalence estimates to over 20 million individuals. For people with cancer, the build-up of lymph fluid can be caused by surgery, especially when lymph nodes are removed, radiation therapy that can damage lymph nodes and vessels, infections that damage surrounding tissue or cause scarring and other conditions.
In the fourth quarter of 2016 we expanded the indications for use of the Flexitouch system. We received U.S. FDA clearance to market a first-of-its-kind system to treat patients suffering from lymphedema of the head and neck, a frequent consequence of head and neck cancer and its treatment. Patient symptoms often include significant skin changes, pain and discomfort, as well as difficulty breathing and swallowing. The American Cancer Society estimates that 430,000 people in the United States suffer from cancers of the head and neck, and more than 65,000 new patients are diagnosed each year. In a 2016 clinical publication, researchers at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine estimated that more than 75% of patients with head and neck cancer develop lymphedema requiring treatment. Our Flexitouch head and neck system is the only pneumatic compression device with an indication to treat patients suffering from debilitating head and neck lymphedema. We estimate the market opportunity for our Flexitouch head and neck system is approximately $1 billion in the United States, which is based on 75% of the total number of patients suffering from cancers of the head and neck and our average selling price per device. In June 2020, a study published in Supportive Care in Cancer recognized the effectiveness of Flexitouch in treating patients with head and neck related lymphedema. The study, led by Vanderbilt University was a pilot randomized clinical trial reflecting statistically significant reductions in swelling, pain and improvements in the ability to swallow. In addition, in September 2021, we initiated a randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of our Flexitouch Plus system for the treatment of head and neck lymphedema. This study will represent the largest randomized, controlled clinical trial ever conducted for the treatment of head and neck cancer-related lymphedema. The trial will consist of approximately 250 subjects enrolled at six clinical sites and will span the next two years.
Current Treatment and Limitations 
A traditional treatment for lymphedema is complete decongestive therapy consisting of manual lymphatic drainage, which is a specialized application of gentle pressure to the skin applied by a trained therapist that encourages drainage of lymph fluid, as well as decongestive exercises, skin care and compression with multilayered bandages, compression garments or pumps. Typically, this therapy begins with clinic visits three to five times per week for four to eight weeks, which is costly, inconvenient for the patient, and time consuming. At that point, clinical improvement plateaus or reimbursement for the therapy ends and patients transition to self-administered home-based care. Manual lymphatic drainage is difficult for patients to self-administer due to limited range of motion and treatment techniques that are difficult to replicate, and pump-based compression using simple pumps can be uncomfortable and have not demonstrated the clinical and economic benefits of our Flexitouch advanced pneumatic pump. To address these limitations, our at-home Flexitouch system was developed to provide automated lymphatic drainage therapy through an advanced, easy-to-use, self-applied at-home system. Peer-reviewed, published studies have shown that our Flexitouch system provides improved quality of life and clinical outcomes and delivers significant cost savings to payers and patients. 

The standard of care treatment for CVI is compression therapy. Compression stockings and wraps are typically used to provide added pressure, increasing the effectiveness of the calf-muscle pump in returning blood to the heart, but these products can be challenging for patients to apply. As the disease progresses, patients may develop a venous leg ulcer, which is commonly treated using multilayered bandages to minimize swelling and enhance blood flow. A clinician applies these typically non-removable bandages to patients at a precise pressure and patients wear the bandages between weekly visits to the wound clinic during which they are then removed and reapplied. Treatment typically occurs for several months and impairs patient quality of life by limiting bathing, range of motion, comfort and other activities of daily living. Treatment efficacy is inconsistent because bandages can lose their precise pressure between treatments. Enhancing standard of care treatments for CVI with our pneumatic compression systems has been proven to reduce the recurrence of ulcer formations as well as recurrent skin infections (cellulitis) leading to better patient quality of life and lower overall cost of clinical care.
Overview of Bronchiectasis and Cystic Fibrosis 

9




Bronchiectasis is a COPD-associated condition where the lung’s bronchi become inflamed, widened, permanently damaged and scarred. As more of the bronchial wall thickens, mucus gets trapped, creating a breeding ground for infection. The inability to fully clear mucus and pathogens from the lungs can result in a chronic cycle of infections and inflammation. Airway clearance therapies help break this vicious cycle and need to be used regularly to maintain a healthy respiratory system.
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease that causes thickened mucus to form in the lungs, pancreas and other organs. In the lungs, this mucus blocks the airways, creating lung damage and making it hard to breathe. There is no cure for COPD or cystic fibrosis.
Market Opportunity
Bronchiectasis is one of the most common respiratory diseases with over 500,000 U.S. adults diagnosed and is estimated to be growing in the high single-digits annually. More than 16 million people in the U.S. are living with COPD and it is estimated that over 4 million of them may be affected by bronchiectasis. High frequency chest wall oscillation is used to treat bronchiectasis and over 40 other International Classification of Disease (“ICD”)-10 diagnosis codes.
Over 30,000 people in the U.S. struggle with the effects of cystic fibrosis every day. Cystic fibrosis treatment includes airway clearance therapy, of which HFCWO is the standard of care. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry reports 77% of cystic fibrosis patients use HFCWO.
Current Treatment and Limitations
​
Airway clearance therapy (“ACT”) utilizes physical or mechanical means of percussion or vibration to mobilize mucus and phlegm to facilitate airway clearance by coughing. ACT options include huff coughing, chest physiotherapy performed by a therapist or caregiver, active cycle breathing, positive expiratory pressure devices and HFCWO vests. These treatments need to be performed daily to support bronchial hygiene for at-risk respiratory patients. Adherence to treatments and effectiveness of treatments are a significant challenge for patients with these chronic conditions.
​
AffloVest is a HFCWO therapy vest that has eight anatomically positioned oscillating motors that create individual pressure waveforms to target all lobes of the lungs to loosen, thin and mobilize lung secretions.

Our Strategy
Our goal is to become a leader in the at-home treatment of underserved chronic diseases. We intend to leverage our established product, service and fulfillment platforms to be a global provider of clinically proven easy-to-use and cost-effective solutions. The key elements of our strategy include: 

● | Increase awareness of our solutions and establish them as the standards of care. We believe that many patients with lymphedema, chronic venous insufficiency and bronchiectasis remain undiagnosed or undertreated. We intend to further educate physicians, nurses, therapists, patients, payers and DME providers to raise awareness of these diseases, the associated health burdens of such diseases on patients and society, and the clinical and economic benefits of using our products. Further, we intend to continue promoting this awareness through training and educating clinicians, advertising campaigns, exhibiting at tradeshows and physician meetings and publishing additional clinical and economic outcome data demonstrating the benefits of our solutions. Our ongoing marketing initiatives focus on increasing referrals from physicians trained in the diagnosis and treatment of venous and lymphatic diseases, oncology and chronic respiratory conditions. In addition, we plan to launch more extensive direct-to-provider and patient marketing programs that we believe will further increase awareness of our solutions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand our sales and customer support teams. We plan to expand our direct sales and marketing organization to drive greater product adoption by patients suffering from lymphedema and CVI and their clinicians. We also intend to expand and support our respiratory DME channels, in an effort to help demonstrate HFCWO as a staple among the host of treatments they bring to chronic respiratory patients. We intend to strengthen our distribution network by continuing to recruit, train and retain talented sales representatives. With an expanded sales force, our goal is to expand the existing prescriber base.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Demonstrate ongoing innovation to grow our technology platform and expand adoption of our therapies. We are actively developing new products and features for our portfolio in order to expand the number of patients using our products and allow us to enter new clinical adjacencies. We pursue both internal research, design and development, and also work with external collaborators to expand our product offerings. In addition, we evaluate opportunities to license or acquire additional technologies and products to expand our total addressable market opportunity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue the development of clinical and economic outcome data. A key part of our success is our ability to demonstrate the effectiveness of our products through clinical and economic outcome data. We intend to invest in additional studies to support peer-reviewed, published articles that evidence the clinical and economic benefits of our solutions as compared to traditional treatments. We intend to use these data to continue to educate clinicians, payers and patients on the proven advantages of our products compared to other therapies and expand our network of key opinion leader advocates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand third-party reimbursement. Most of our products are covered under existing reimbursement codes, and we have secured coverage for our solutions with commercial payers, Medicare, the Veterans Administration and certain Medicaid programs. Our team has experienced significant success in obtaining positive coverage policies from payers by developing direct relationships with payer decision-makers, leveraging our relationships with physician societies and key opinion leaders, providing clinical data, demonstrating the efficacy of our products and educating payers on the limitations of traditional treatments. We intend to continue this strategic approach to further expand coverage for our solutions, as well as to meet payer-specific requirements on behalf of patients.

Our Products 
We market Flexitouch and Entre systems as at-home therapies for the treatment of lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency. We market AffloVest as an at-home therapy intended to promote airway clearance. These products have received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to be marketed in the United States. We believe our products have unique features and benefits that address the shortcomings of traditional treatments, are more cost-effective and enable more consistent and effective therapy, leading to enhanced patient quality of life, improved clinical outcomes and reduced cost of care. 
Flexitouch System 
Our Flexitouch Plus system is a fully automated, programmable, advanced pneumatic compression device, or APCD, designed for treatment of lymphedema in the home setting. Our Flexitouch system has received 510(k) clearance for the treatment of lymphedema, phlebolymphedema, lipedema, certain types of other edema, venous insufficiencies and certain types of leg ulcers. We introduced our first-generation Flexitouch system in the United States in 2003, our second-generation Flexitouch system in 2006, and our third-generation Flexitouch system, the Flexitouch Plus, in 2018. The mechanism of action of our patented Flexitouch Plus system is designed to stimulate the lymphatic system similar to manual lymphatic drainage therapy, the current standard of care in patient treatment. By automating this technique, we believe our system offers an effective, cost-efficient, convenient and accessible at-home treatment for patients. 
Our Flexitouch Plus system consists of an electronic controller unit that offers 17 treatment settings and multiple contoured garment configurations for the trunk, chest, head, neck and the arm or leg. Our Flexitouch Plus is the only pneumatic compression system offering the flexibility for treating upper and lower extremities, the trunk and chest, and the head and neck. The electronic controller is a pneumatic compressor with four connector outlets. Each connector has eight outflow ports into which the garment hoses are connected. Our unique garments contain up to 32 air chambers, are made of a soft, pliable fabric and are designed with hook-and-loop fasteners to fit snugly around affected areas for maximum comfort and optimum pressure delivery. The garments come in a variety of sizes that can be easily adjusted to patients of all sizes. When our system is activated, air passes through the hoses, delivering sequential inflation and deflation to the garments and applying gentle pressure to the skin. The inflation sequence is designed to stimulate the lymphatic system, moving lymph fluid from the impaired areas toward healthy regions of the body. 
The electronic controller unit adjusts the amount of pressure and the timing of the pressure and release cycles. This unit is lightweight and easily portable, providing maximum convenience for at-home treatment. A typical therapy session using our Flexitouch Plus system lasts up to one hour, with additional treatment options available if prescribed by a clinician. 
Entre System 
We introduced our Entre system in the United States in February 2013 to offer a lightweight, portable pneumatic compression solution for patients with cognitive or dexterity issues who need a basic (simple) pump or for patients who do not yet qualify for insurance coverage of an advanced compression device such as our Flexitouch Plus system. Our Entre system is a basic pneumatic compression device used for the at-home treatment of venous disorders including lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency, including venous leg ulcers. Our Entre system is a pump with garments covering the arm or leg with eight chambers that inflate in sequence and remain inflated for a preset time period. All chambers deflate at once. Our Entre system moves fluid from fingers or toes toward areas closer to the trunk. The system can be programmed to a variety of pressures delivering a prescribed treatment customized to meet the patient's needs.
AffloVest
We acquired the AffloVest business in September 2021. The AffloVest is the first truly portable high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) vest. The device is battery-powered and affords patients the ability to ambulate while receiving treatment, as well as increases the likelihood that their treatment will travel with them. The AffloVest treats patients with retained pulmonary secretions resulting from bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis and a host of neuromuscular disorders. The AffloVest offers various treatment modes and intensities. 

12




The user can set and store their personalized default treatment settings. Our AffloVest system has received 510(k) clearance as a HFCWO device and is intended for promoting airway clearance and improvement of bronchial drainage by enhancing mobilization of bronchial secretions where manipulation of the thorax is the physician’s choice of treatment.

Clinical Results and Studies
Overview 
A key part of our success is our ability to demonstrate the effectiveness of our products by funding studies that generate clinical and economic outcome data supporting our products. We have developed a significant body of clinical data supporting the efficacy and safety of our products. We intend to continue to invest in additional studies to support peer-reviewed, published articles that evidence the clinical and economic benefits of our solutions as compared to traditional treatments. To date, more than 25 studies regarding the safety and efficacy of our products have been completed, in which over 2,100 subjects have been included. 
Economic Impact of our Flexitouch System in Patients with Phlebolymphedema 
A retrospective longitudinal matched case-control analysis of de-identified private insurance claims published by the Journal of Vascular Surgery in 2018 indicated significant benefits attributable to our Flexitouch system as compared to alternative compression therapies currently employed to help reduce the notable economic burden of phlebolymphedema (chronic venous insufficiency-related lymphedema). The study used administrative claims data from Blue Health Intelligence for the years 2012 through 2016. Patients were required to be continuously enrolled in the health plan for at least 18 months, diagnosed with phlebolymphedema, and had received at least one claim for conservative therapy either alone or in addition to a pneumatic compression device, or PCD. The main outcomes included direct phlebolymphedema- and sequelae-related medical resource utilization and costs. 
Prior to case matching, 1,065 patients met these criteria. After case matching, the study included: 86 patients using conservative therapy matched with 87 patients on Flexitouch; 34 patients on simple PCDs, or SPCDs, matched with 23 patients on Flexitouch; and 69 patients on other advanced PCDs, or APCDs, matched with 67 patients on Flexitouch. Compared with conservative therapy alone, Flexitouch patients were associated with 69% lower per patient per year total phlebolymphedema- and sequelae-related costs net of any PCD-related costs ($3,839 vs $12,253; P=0.001). This was driven by 59% fewer mean annual hospitalizations (0.13 vs 0.32; P<0.001) corresponding to 82% lower inpatient costs and 55% lower outpatient hospital costs. Flexitouch patients were also associated with 52% lower outpatient physical therapy and occupational therapy costs and 56% lower other outpatient-related costs. Compared with SPCDs, Flexitouch was associated with 85% lower total costs ($1,153 vs $7,449; P=0.008) driven by 93% lower inpatient costs ($297 vs $4,215; P=0.002), 84% lower outpatient hospital costs ($368 vs $2,347; P=0.020), and 85% lower other outpatient-related costs ($353 vs $2,313; P=0.023). Compared with other APCDs, Flexitouch was associated with 53% lower total costs ($3,973 vs $8,436; P=0.032) because of lower outpatient costs and lower rates of cellulitis infections (22.4% vs 44.9% of patients; P=0.02).
Impact on Clinical Outcomes and Healthcare Costs with Use of our Flexitouch System 
A retrospective study published by the American Medical Association in JAMA Dermatology demonstrated significant improvement in key clinical endpoints and immediate cost reductions for individuals with lymphedema following receipt of our Flexitouch system. The study was conducted in the United States and included 718 patients with a lymphedema diagnosis who had continuous insurance coverage during the 12 months prior to and the 12 months after receiving our Flexitouch system from 2007 through 2013. 
The study evaluated a broad, clinically relevant set of healthcare use outcomes for each patient for the 12 months before and the 12 months after receipt of our Flexitouch system, including cellulitis infections, inpatient hospitalizations, physical therapy and outpatient hospital visits. Receipt of our Flexitouch system was associated with a significant decline in the rate of cellulitis diagnosis in the cancer-related lymphedema patients of 79% (from 21.1% to 4.5%; p<0.001) and in the non-cancer-related lymphedema patients of 75% (from 28.8% to 7.3%; p<0.001). The inpatient hospitalization rate declined 22% in the cancer-related group (from 2.7% to 

13




2.1%; p=0.63) and declined 54% in the non-cancer-related group (from 7.0% to 3.2%; p=0.02). The manual therapy rate decreased 30% in the cancer-related lymphedema patients (from 35.6% to 24.9%; p=0.001) and decreased 34% in the non-cancer-related lymphedema patients (from 32.3% to 21.2%; p=0.001). In addition, outpatient hospital visits declined 29% in the cancer-related patients (from 58.6% to 41.4%; p<0.001) and 40% in the non-cancer-related patients (from 52.6% to 31.4%; p<0.001). 
The study also reviewed lymphedema-related healthcare costs for each patient in the study for the 12 months before and the 12 months after receipt of our Flexitouch system. Among the cancer-related lymphedema patients, total costs per patient, excluding durable medical equipment costs, were reduced by 37%, from $2,597 to $1,642 (p=0.002) following receipt of our Flexitouch system. The greatest contributor to this change was a 54% reduction in outpatient hospital costs from $1,517 to $694 (p<0.001). Total costs per non-cancer-related lymphedema patient, excluding durable medical equipment costs, were reduced by 36% from $2,937 to $1,883 (p=0.007). Outpatient hospital costs for the non-cancer patients declined by 65% from $1,726 to $606 (p<0.001). 
Flexitouch System Impact on Limb Volume and Patient-Reported Outcomes 
A prospective study published in the European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery demonstrated that use of our Flexitouch system is associated with statistically significant reduction in limb volume, improvement in quality of life and no significant adverse effects. The study was conducted in the United States and collected data from a patient registry required by a third-party payer for 196 patients with lower extremity lymphedema who were prescribed our Flexitouch system from January 2009 to May 2012. The primary objective of the study was to examine the effectiveness of our Flexitouch system in reducing lower extremity limb volume, with a secondary objective of evaluating clinician-assessed and patient-reported outcomes. 
Use of our Flexitouch system was associated with a statistically significant reduction in limb volume with 88% of patients experiencing a reduction in limb volume and with 35% enjoying a substantial reduction in limb volume of greater than 10%. Twelve percent of patients experienced an increase in limb volume. Clinician assessment indicated that the majority of patients experienced improvement in the condition of their skin. Eighty-six percent of the patients exhibited a reduction in skin hardening (fibrosis) based on manual assessment of the skin. Based on clinical observation of function, 85% of patients demonstrated an increased ability to perform activities of daily living. Additionally, 77% of patients demonstrated improved range of motion.
 ​
Patients reported a significant increase in their ability to control lymphedema through treatment with our Flexitouch system, with an increase in function and a reduction in pain. Of the 98 patients who responded, 66% reported being "very satisfied" with the treatment by our Flexitouch system and 29, or 30%, of patients reported being "satisfied" with the treatment by our Flexitouch system.
Comparison of our Flexitouch System with Simple Pneumatic Compression Devices 
A prospective, randomized controlled trial published in Supportive Care in Cancer demonstrated that our Flexitouch system provides better clinical outcomes as compared to those achieved with a simple pneumatic compression device for home-based treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema. The study was conducted in the United States and involved 36 patients. The number of participants in this study is considered to be a small sample size and a limitation of the study. However, it is one of the only published randomized controlled trials comparing PCDs, and we believe is currently the only published study of PCDs that reported comprehensively on adverse events. The patients were randomized to our Flexitouch system or a simple pneumatic compression device used for home treatment of one-hour per day for 12 weeks. The simple pneumatic compression device used in the study was a Bio Compression 2004 Sequential Circulator pneumatic compression device. The primary objective of the study was to determine whether our Flexitouch system provides better outcomes, as measured by arm edema and tissue water reductions, compared to a simple pneumatic compression device in patients with arm lymphedema. The study does not reflect a comparison of our Flexitouch system to a product that is billed under the same Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, or HCPCS, Code as our Flexitouch system.

Thirty-six patients with unilateral upper extremity lymphedema with at least 5% arm edema volume at the time of enrollment completed treatments over the 12-week period, with 26 patients being evaluated for edema volume change and 28 patients being evaluated for changes in arm tissue water content. Arm edema volumes were determined from arm girth measurements and suitable model calculations, and tissue water was determined based on measurements of the arm tissue. The patients were randomized into two groups of 18 patients each, with one group receiving treatment with our Flexitouch system and the other group receiving treatment using a simple pneumatic compression device. The group using our Flexitouch system experienced an average reduction in edema of 29% compared to a 16% increase in the group using a simple pneumatic compression device. 
Study of Patient-Reported Satisfaction with Use of our Flexitouch System 
A retrospective study published in the Oncology Nursing Forum demonstrated that patients using our Flexitouch system were satisfied with the device and perceived it to be beneficial in managing their lymphedema. The study was conducted in the United States and involved 155 patients with lymphedema whose treatment was initiated from March 2004 to May 2006. The primary objective of the study was to compare treatment protocol adherence, satisfaction and perceived changes in emotional and functional status between patients with cancer-related lymphedema and non-cancer-related lymphedema using our Flexitouch system. 
Ninety percent of the 155 study patients reported being "satisfied" with our Flexitouch system. Of these patients, more than 65% reported being "extremely satisfied." Further, 95% of patients reported a positive limb volume outcome, which was defined as a patient perceiving that limb volume had been maintained or reduced with device use. Of these patients, 42% reported limb volume decreases as much as 20%, and an additional 20% reported decreases of less than 20%. In addition, clinically and statistically significant improvements occurred in all areas of physical and emotional health (p<0.006). 
Flexitouch System Impact on Patient-Reported Improved Quality-of-Life 
A prospective observational study published in Annals of Vascular Surgery demonstrated that use of our Flexitouch system is associated with patient-reported overall improvement in quality-of-life and lower extremity-related symptoms. The study was conducted in the United States and collected data from patients presenting for treatment of lower-extremity lymphedema from March 2011 to September 2014. A total of 100 consecutive patients with lower-extremity lymphedema met inclusion criteria and were included in the study. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate improved quality-of-life in patients with lower-extremity lymphedema with Flexitouch system treatment. The secondary objective was to demonstrate reduced infectious complications of lymphedema with Flexitouch system treatment, and to determine the incidence of concomitant venous insufficiency in patients with lymphedema. 
Use of our Flexitouch system was associated with overall improvement in lower extremity-related symptoms, with 54% of patients reporting greatly improved symptom control after use of our Flexitouch system, 35% moderately improved and 11% mildly improved. In the year before use of our Flexitouch system, 15% of the patients reported 26 episodes of cellulitis, which decreased to five episodes after initiation of the Flexitouch system (P=0.002) in subsequent median follow-up of 12.7 months. Eight percent of patients reported skin ulceration of the affected extremity in the year before presentation for treatment. The number of lower-extremity ulcers pre- and post-Flexitouch system use decreased from seven to two (P=0.007). Overall, 46% of the patients had complete limb girth measurements at the ankle and calf, and there was a statistically significant decreased overall limb girth after Flexitouch system treatment in pre- and post-ankle (28.3 cm vs. 27.5 cm, P=0.01), and calf mean girths (44.7 cm vs. 43.8 cm, P=0.018). In addition, venous reflux was present in 18% of patients, 14% and 4% within the superficial and deep venous system respectively. In patients with venous reflux, moderate to great improvement in symptoms was reported in 7% and 11%, respectively compared with 28% and 43% in patients without venous reflux (P=0.257).
Advanced Pneumatic Compression for Treatment of Lymphedema of the Head and Neck
An open label, randomized wait-list controlled trial published in the Supportive Care in Cancer journal supported the safety and feasibility of the Flexitouch system APCD for the treatment of secondary lymphedema in head and neck cancer, or HNC, patients. This study was conducted in the United States and included 49 

15




head and neck cancer patients. Eligible patients had completed treatment for HNC, were disease free, and had lymphedema at enrollment. Participants were randomized to wait-list lymphedema self-management (standard of care) or lymphedema self-management plus the use of the APCD bib. Safety (CTCAE V4.0) and feasibility were primary endpoints; secondary endpoints included efficacy measure by objective examination and patient reported outcomes (symptoms, quality of life, function) adherence barriers, and satisfaction. Assessments were conducted at baseline and weeks 4 and 8.
No device-related serious adverse events were reported. Most patients used the APCD once per day, instead of the prescribed twice per day, citing time related factors as barriers to use. Patients in the intervention group reported improvement in perceived ability to control lymphedema (baseline: 5/19, 26% good or excellent; 8 weeks: 16/19, 84% good or excellent, p=0.003) and visible external swelling (front view p<0.001, right view p=0.004, left p=0.005), as well as less reported pain. Relative to patients in the control group, at 8-weeks patients using the Flexitouch system had statistically significant reductions in the reported severity of soft tissue (p=0.008, d =−0.86) and neurological symptoms (p=0.047, d=−0.60) clusters on the Lymphedema Symptom Intensity and Distress Survey-Head and Neck. Relative to patients in the control group, patients using the Flexitouch system had statistically significant improvement in swallowing solids (p=0.016) and mucous related symptoms (p=0.050, d=−0.80 and −0.57 respectively) on the Vanderbilt Head and Neck Symptom Survey plus General Symptom Survey.
AffloVest Clinical Evidence
The use of the AffloVest in patients with cystic fibrosis (“CF”) has been studied and reported on in non-peer reviewed journals. In 2016, a prospective study was conducted of 25 patients who were asked to augment their current airway treatment regimen with the AffloVest. These patients ranged from 11 to 18 years old and used AffloVest for periods of one month to almost a full year. Twelve patients demonstrated measurable improvement in multiple lung function tests: Forced Vital Capacity (“FVC”) increased 15.22%, Forced Expiratory Volume 1 (“FEV1”) increased 17.41% and Forced Expiratory Flow (“FEF”) 25-75% increased 11.21% respectively. Eleven of the 12 patients who demonstrated positive improvement in their lung scores, and in whom those scores were maintained for nearly one year, had been using air bladder style vests previously. The remaining 13 patients saw no significant increase, and no decrease, in lung function.
​
A prospective, single-site study was published in Respiratory Therapy in 2018 and compared the impact of traditional compressor/bladder-style HFCWO vests with that of the mobile, battery-powered AffloVest on lung function measures in 32 healthy patients. The results showed no significant difference between the technologies in increased airflow in the lungs during treatment. AffloVest performed favorably to traditional vests in that it produced no significant decline in forced vital capacity or forced expiratory volume, while the traditional vests did show statistically significant declines in these measures.
​
In 2020, a chart review study of 30 patients compared the need for antibiotic therapy due to exacerbation, based on the number of prescriptions, emergency room visits and hospitalizations in the period approximately six months before each patient started AffloVest HFCWO therapy compared to the period six months after initiating AffloVest HFCWO therapy. The results showed a 96.2% reduction in hospitalizations, 82.4% reduction in emergency room visits, and 87.3% reduction in antibiotic usage for the post-AffloVest group.
The AffloVest has a history of clinical evidence, and Tactile Medical is committed to supporting additional studies to further support the benefits of this differentiated HFCWO technology. 

Sales and Marketing 
Unlike many of our competitors, we utilize a direct-to-patient and -provider model to market our pneumatic compression portfolio solutions directly to patients and clinics, providing high-quality customer service and capturing both the manufacturer and distributor margins. The direct channel allows us to focus on two of our primary call points, vascular and oncology. For AffloVest, we utilize the respiratory DME channel as our go-to-market method. Our utilization of the thousands of respiratory DME representatives gives us access to a larger channel than competitors that market and sell directly. The respiratory DME channel also already serves the chronic respiratory community, enabling them to identify candidates who are regularly on other 

16




respiratory therapies (such as oxygen, nebulizers, non-invasive ventilators, etc.) and who might benefit from the use of our AffloVest. The below chart reflects these models:

 Our direct-to-patient and -provider lymphedema business is composed of a direct sales force, patient training and support, reimbursement capabilities and medical expertise to educate, expand awareness, coordinate referrals and obtain payment for our products.
The chart below describes our U.S. direct-to-patient and -provider model for our lymphedema business. 

We sell the AffloVest to DME providers in the U.S. that service patients and bill third party payers for the product. The DME providers obtain the prescription and coordinate with patients and payers to determine insurance eligibility and payment. These DME providers are staffed by trained respiratory therapists who are required in some states to set up patients on at-home prescription respiratory therapies like AffloVest. We market and educate DME providers and clinicians about the AffloVest advantages. As of December 31, 2021, we also employed a small group of respiratory specialists, who educate DME provider representatives, provide product demonstrations for targeted clinicians and support technical questions related to the AffloVest. 

17




The chart below describes our DME model.

As of December 31, 2021, we employed a field staff of 252 Tactile employees, made up of sales and service representatives, as well as managers, who provide support throughout the United States for our lymphedema and respiratory therapies.
Our marketing team leads our efforts in brand development, product messaging, tradeshow attendance, medical educational forums, website development, social media and advertising.

Reimbursement, Payer Relations and Customer Support Process
Private insurers and other payers represented approximately 68% and 71% of our revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively, while Medicare represented approximately 17% and 16% of our revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively, Veterans Administration hospitals represented approximately 13% of our revenue in both 2021 and 2020, and DME distributors represented approximately 2% of our revenue in 2021. When we sell our solutions directly to patients, we generally bill third-party payers, such as commercial insurance or Medicare, on behalf of our patients and bill the patient for their copayment obligations and deductibles.
As a nationwide provider, we have developed a broad expertise in obtaining billing codes, in-network contracts, developing coverage policies, overcoming payer barriers and obtaining authorization and payment from payers across all regions of the United States. Our model utilizes our strategic and operational reimbursement proficiency to meet the varying requirements of hundreds of payers across the country. 
Our reimbursement function includes payer relations and reimbursement operations. Our payer relations function focuses on payer policy development and education for our entire portfolio, as well as contract negotiations for our direct business, and data analysis. Our reimbursement operations function is responsible for verifying patient insurance benefits, individual patient case development, prior authorization submissions, case follow-up, and appeals when necessary. The reimbursement operations function is organized into “regional payer lanes” so that each case is handled throughout the process by experts in specific payer requirements.
We have strong and established payer relationships, including most of the largest private payers in the United States. Based on our estimates, we are contracted or enrolled as an in-network provider with payers covering nearly 275 million lives. These contracts allow us to be an in-network provider for patients, enabling them to access our systems at a competitive rate and copay comparable to other suppliers and easing our administrative burden in processing authorizations and claims. We have enjoyed a consistent commercial payer approval rate of greater than 80% for the last ten years, and a greater than 90% Medicare claims submitted 

18




approval rate (post-arbitration and based on the number of claims, not dollar amount of claims, submitted across all our products) since we began doing business with Medicare in 2007. We have an in-depth understanding of specific payer coverage criteria, and our submission materials are tailored to address an individual payer's distinct requirements. Our dedicated customer service team is available to answer patient questions regarding reimbursement, account status, device operation and troubleshooting during normal business hours. We receive no additional reimbursement for patient support, but provide high-quality customer service and continuity to enhance patient comfort, satisfaction, compliance and safety with our products. 
Our Flexitouch Plus system controller is reimbursed under HCPCS code E0652, and our Entre system controller is reimbursed under HCPCS code E0651. Garments that cover various parts of the body are used with these systems and billed using HCPCS codes E0667, E0668 and E0669. Our head and neck garments do not currently have billing codes assigned. To date, over 1,100 payers have paid for our products.
Our respiratory DME partners contract directly with commercial payers and regularly serve as a consolidated source for various respiratory-related therapies. The DME distributor obtains the prescription and, in coordination with the patient and payer, determines insurance eligibility and payment. The AffloVest is reimbursed under HCPCS code E0483, high frequency chest wall oscillation for bronchiectasis, and over 40 other ICD-10 diagnosis codes. 

Research and Clinical Operations
We are committed to ongoing research and development as part of our efforts to be at the forefront of physician and patient preference in the area of chronic disease, especially lymphedema, cancer-related lymphedema, chronic venous insufficiency, bronchiectasis and other chronic respiratory conditions. Our research and development and clinical operations functions include scientists, clinical monitors and project managers with expertise in pneumatics, electronics, garment design, embedded software, mechanical design, sensors, manufacturing technologies and clinical trial management. Our current research and development efforts are focused primarily on increasing efficacy, improving design for ease-of-use, enhancing clinical functionality and reducing production costs of our solutions. Our clinical development efforts are focused on further differentiating our products from our competitors. We coordinate our development efforts with our intellectual property strategies in order to enhance our ability to obtain patent and other intellectual property protection. Our research and development expenses, including spending on our clinical evidence development efforts, totaled $5.7 million and $5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
Our manufacturing and quality assurance model combines our internal manufacturing resources and expertise, including assembly, quality assurance, material procurement and inventory control, with approved third-party manufacturers and suppliers of system components. Our internal manufacturing activities, located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, include quality inspection, assembly, packaging, warehousing and shipping of our products. We outsource the manufacture of components, which are produced to our specifications and shipped to our facilities for inspection and final assembly. We use third-party manufacturers and suppliers worldwide to source our components, maintaining dual-source vendors of critical components whenever possible, and leveraging competitive bids among third-party manufacturers and suppliers to control costs. Quality control, risk management, efficiency and the ability to respond quickly to changing requirements are the primary goals of our manufacturing operations. We believe our manufacturing model permits us to operate with low capital expenditure requirements. We carefully manage our supply chain in an effort to take costs out of the manufacturing process. 
We manage our arrangements with our third-party manufacturers and suppliers to adjust delivery schedules and quantities of components to match our changing manufacturing requirements. We forecast our component needs based on historical trends, current utilization patterns and sales forecasts of future demand. We establish our relationships with our third-party manufacturers and suppliers through supplier contracts and purchase orders. In most cases, these supplier relationships may be terminated by either party upon reasonable notice. 

19




In order to mitigate against the risks related to a single source of supply, we qualify alternative suppliers, when possible, and develop contingency plans for responding to disruptions, including maintaining adequate inventory of any single source components, along with requiring each supplier to maintain specified quantities of inventory. To date, we have not experienced material delays in obtaining any of our components, nor has the ready supply of finished products to our patients or clinicians been adversely impacted by component supply issues. 
We have implemented a quality management system designed to comply with FDA regulations and International Standards Organization, or ISO, standards governing medical device products. In the United States, we and some of our manufacturers are required to manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation, which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping for our products. We maintain a quality management system to control compliance with such requirements and have procedures in place designed to ensure that all products and materials purchased by us conform to our requirements and FDA regulations. Our quality management system has been certified to ISO 13485:2003 in 2012, 2014 and 2017, and to ISO 13485:2016 in 2019, 2020 and 2021. In 2021, we also received our Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”) certification. An MDSAP allows an MDSAP-recognized Auditing Organization to conduct a single regulatory audit of a medical device manufacturer that satisfies the relevant requirements of the regulatory authorities participating in the program. Many of our manufacturers’ quality management systems also have been certified to ISO.

Order Fulfillment and Patient Education 
With respect to our Flexitouch and Entre systems, once we have a complete patient order and appropriate documentation from the payer, we package and ship the system, configured to their physician's prescription, directly to the patient. We utilize third-party carriers for delivery and pick up of our devices. After delivery and when requested by our patient, we coordinate a virtual or at-home visit from one of our licensed trainers to provide education, clinical support or customer service. These trainers are healthcare professionals, licensed in their state of residence, instructed on proper use of our products. Patient visits are coordinated from our offices in Minneapolis and training sessions are assigned by our staff.
Our AffloVest product is packaged and shipped to the DME provider or drop-shipped directly to a patient, as directed. We utilize third-party carriers for delivery and pick up of our AffloVest products. In situations in which the product is shipped to the DME provider, they are responsible for completing the delivery to the patient. Upon receipt of the product, patients are able to utilize materials included with the product to complete self-training or engage with the DME provider for additional support.

Competition 
The pneumatic compression pump market is composed of a number of manufacturers and distributors of pneumatic compression pumps. Our most significant manufacturing competitors are Bio Compression Systems, Inc. and Lympha Press USA. Other competitors are Airos Medical, Inc. and NormaTec Industries. 
 Given the growth of the pneumatic compression pump market, we expect that the industry will become increasingly competitive in the future. Manufacturing companies compete for sales to patients primarily based on product features and service. 
We believe we are the only pneumatic compression home-therapy device company with a meaningful U.S. market position supported by a direct sales force. We believe our manufacturing competitors' complete reliance on DME distribution intermediaries compresses their margins and limits their ability to invest in clinical evidence and product features that address consumer preferences. To pursue a direct-to-patient and -provider sales model, our manufacturing competitors would need to meet national accreditation and state-by-state licensing requirements, secure Medicare billing privileges, as well as compete directly with the home medical equipment providers that many rely on across their entire home care businesses. 
We anticipate that, given the size of the available market, we will face increased competition in the future as existing companies and competitors develop new or improved products and distribution strategies 

20




and as new companies enter the market with new technologies and distribution strategies. Our ability to compete successfully and to increase our market share is dependent upon our reputation for providing responsive, professional and high-quality products and services and achieving strong customer satisfaction. 
Competitors within the airway clearance market consist largely of three other HFCWO vest manufacturers: Hill-Rom, Philips Medical and Electromed. While we believe AffloVest’s portability and our use of DME distributors are differentiators, we anticipate that given the size of the airway clearance market, we will continue to see vigorous competition. We intend to further expand and support our respiratory DME relationships, as well as invest in product development to better support this still-underserved area.

Government Regulation 
Our systems are medical devices subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA, and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. 
FDA Regulation 
In the United States, the FDA regulates medical devices, including the following activities that we perform, or that are performed on our behalf with respect to our devices: product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, premarket clearance or approval, record keeping, product marketing, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, and post-marketing surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. The FDA can also refuse to clear or approve pending applications.
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we seek to distribute commercially in the United States requires marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device, which is based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device's safety and effectiveness. 
Our Flexitouch, Entre and AffloVest systems (all models) are Class II devices under the FDA classification system requiring 510(k) clearance. We obtained 510(k) clearance for our Flexitouch system in October 2006 and for a discontinued predecessor system in July 2002. In September 2016, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the Flexitouch system for treating lymphedema of the head and neck. In June 2017, we announced that we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the Flexitouch Plus, the third-generation version of our Flexitouch system. In December 2020, we received 510(k) clearance for two new indications for our Flexitouch Plus system: phlebolymphedema and lipedema. We obtained 510(k) clearance for our Entre system in May 2015. 510(k) clearance for the AffloVest system was obtained in 2013. All of our Class II devices have obtained 510(k) clearance and that status remains current as of the date of this filing.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance or a premarket approval, in general any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or approval. Thus, modifications to our existing devices will be evaluated to ensure ongoing compliance to the FDA requirements.
Further, even after a device receives clearance or approval by the FDA and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:

● | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | quality system regulation, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21





● | labeling regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or "off-label" uses, and other requirements related to promotional activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation that may present a risk to health; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any new Class II devices developed by us will be submitted to the FDA as required by the 510(k) process. Under this process, when a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is "substantially equivalent" to a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a premarket approval application, which is commonly known as the "predicate device." In 2019, the FDA released an optional Safety and Performance Based Pathway for 510(k) clearance, which allows a submitter to demonstrate that an eligible new device of a well-understood type meets FDA-identified performance criteria to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a previously-cleared device or use, the FDA will issue a not substantially equivalent decision. This means the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process and will require marketing authorization through the premarket approval pathway. 
A premarket approval application must be submitted to the FDA if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. The premarket approval application process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process and requires the payment of significant user fees. A premarket approval application must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including but not limited to technical, pre-clinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA's satisfaction reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness of the device. 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: Warning Letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of our products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, denying our request for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, rescinding previously granted 510(k) clearances or withdrawing previously granted premarket approvals. 
We are also subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. We were audited three times since January 2010 by the FDA and found to be in compliance with the Quality System Regulation. We cannot assure you that we can maintain a comparable level of regulatory compliance in the future at our facilities. 
FTC Regulation 
Device advertising and promotional activity in certain circumstances is also subject to scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as similar state consumer protection agencies, which enforce laws related to false and deceptive trade practices. A company that is found to have advertised its product in violation of these laws may be subject to liability, including monetary penalties. 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, requires providers of products or services to attain and maintain accreditation in order to participate in federally funded healthcare programs. To attain and maintain accreditation, companies are required to institute policies and procedures that, among other things, 

22




formalize the interaction of the company with patients. Accrediting bodies that are approved (“deemed”) by CMS will perform audits of these policies and procedures every three years. Should a company fall out of compliance with the requirements of the accrediting body, expulsion from the Medicare program could follow. In May 2008, we became a Durable, Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies accredited supplier by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care. This accreditation must be renewed every three years through a recredentialing process that includes an on-site review. We last renewed our accreditation with our accrediting body in May 2020. Maintaining our accreditation and Medicare enrollment requires that we comply with numerous business and customer support standards. If we are deemed out of compliance with accreditation standards, our enrollment status in the Medicare program could be jeopardized, up to and including termination. 
Licensure 
Several states require that durable medical equipment providers be licensed in order to sell products to patients in that state. Certain of these states require that durable medical equipment providers maintain an in-state location. Most of our state licenses are renewed on an annual or bi-annual basis. In addition, we are subject to certain state laws regarding professional licensure. 
Fraud and Abuse Regulations 
Federal Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Laws.    The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, among other things, prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration, whether directly or indirectly and overtly or covertly, in return for, or to induce the referral of an individual for the:

● | furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | purchase, lease, or order of, or the arrangement or recommendation of the purchasing, leasing, or ordering of any item or service reimbursable in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute applies to certain arrangements with healthcare providers, product end users and other parties, including marketing arrangements and discounts and other financial incentives offered to our clinicians in connection with the sales of our products. The statute is very broad, but includes statutory safe harbors (such as a discount safe harbor) to ensure that if a company tailors its conduct in accordance with a safe harbor, it will not violate the statute.
Noncompliance with the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in civil, administrative and criminal penalties, restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. In addition, to the extent we are found to not be in compliance, we may be required to curtail or restructure our operations. 
The Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, commonly known as the "Stark Law," prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain "designated health services" payable by Medicare to an entity, including a company that furnishes durable medical equipment, in which the physician or an immediate family member of such physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement unless an exception applies. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliant arrangement, civil penalties and exclusion from Medicare or other governmental programs. 
Additionally, because some of these laws continue to evolve, we lack definitive guidance as to the application of certain key aspects of these laws as they relate to our arrangements with providers with respect to patient training. We cannot predict the final form that these regulations will take or the effect that the final regulations will have on us. As a result, our provider arrangements may ultimately be found to be non-compliant with applicable federal law. 

23




False statements.    The federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or omitting a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of healthcare benefits, items, or services. In addition to criminal penalties, violation of this statute may result in collateral administrative sanctions, including exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. 
Federal False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties Law.    The Federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, any false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim paid or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government or knowingly retained an overpayment. In addition, amendments to the Federal False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring whistleblower lawsuits against companies. 
The Civil Monetary Penalties Law provides, in part, that the federal government may seek civil monetary penalties against any person that, like under the Federal False Claims Act, presents or causes to be presented claims to a Federal health care program that the person knows or should know is for an item or services that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent or that has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim paid. The federal government may also seek civil monetary penalties for a wide variety of other conduct, including offering remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary's selection of providers and violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. 
If we are found to be in violation of the Federal False Claims Act or the Civil Monetary Penalties laws, penalties include fines for each false claim violation of the Federal False Claims Act and varying amounts based on the type of violation of the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, plus up to three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person. In addition, the federal government may also seek exclusion from participation in all federal health care programs. 
In addition, we bill Medicare Part B and other insurers directly for each sale to patients. As a result, we must comply with all laws, rules and regulations associated with filing claims with the Medicare program, including the Social Security Act, Medicare regulations, the Federal False Claims Act and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, as well as a variety of additional federal and state laws. During an audit, insurers typically expect to find explicit documentation in the medical record to support a claim. Physicians and other clinicians, who are responsible for prescribing our products for patients, are expected to create and maintain the medical records that form the basis for the claims we submit to Medicare and other insurers. Any failure to properly document the medical records for patients using our products could invalidate claims, impair our ability to collect submitted claims and subject us to overpayment liabilities, Federal False Claims Act liabilities and other penalties including exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance programs. 
State fraud and abuse provisions. Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and false claims acts that apply regardless of payer, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. In some states, these laws apply, and we believe that we are in compliance with such laws. Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Other Anti-Corruption Laws.    We may be subject to a variety of domestic and foreign anti-corruption laws with respect to our regulatory compliance efforts and operations. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, commonly known as the FCPA, is a criminal statute that prohibits an individual or business from paying, offering, promising or authorizing the provision of money (such as a bribe or kickback) or anything else of value (such as an improper gift, hospitality, or favor), directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining, retaining, or directing business or other advantages (such as favorable regulatory rulings). In addition to the FCPA, there are a number of other federal and state anti-corruption laws to which we may be subject, including, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 USC § 201 (which prohibits bribing U.S. government officials) and the U.S. Travel Act (which in some instances addresses private-sector or commercial bribery both within and outside the United States). Also, a number of 

24




other countries have their own domestic and international anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Bribery Act 2010. 
We could be held liable under the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws for the illegal activities of our employees, representatives, contractors, collaborators, agents, subsidiaries, or affiliates, even if we did not explicitly authorize such activity. Although we will seek to comply with anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, collaborators, agents, subsidiaries or affiliates will comply with these laws at all times. Violation of these laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain governments or other persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. In addition, our directors, officers, employees, and other representatives who engage in violations of the FCPA and certain other anti-corruption statutes may face imprisonment, fines and penalties. 
State and federal transparency/reporting requirements.    As part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, the Federal government has created a transparency program known as Open Payments (the Physician Payments Sunshine Act) which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies to report annually to the CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals (“covered recipients”) and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2021, tracking and reporting was expanded to include additional covered recipients, namely physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives. Failure to submit timely, accurate and complete information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for "knowing failures to report." Certain states require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the device industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or prohibition and tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities. 
The laws described above impact the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with hospitals, healthcare professionals or other potential purchasers of our products. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws or regulations described above or others that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
HIPAA.    The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, established uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, which are referred to as covered entities. The standards promulgated under HIPAA's regulations include those that:

● | restrict the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, or "protected health information";
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establish standards for common electronic healthcare transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | require covered entities to implement and maintain certain security measures to safeguard certain electronic health information, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | require covered entitles to provide notification to affected individuals, the Department of Health and Human Services and the media in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25




The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or ARRA, expanded HIPAA's privacy and security standards. ARRA includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, which, among other things, made HIPAA's privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates of covered entities. A business associate is a person or entity that performs certain functions or activities on behalf of a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information. As a result, business associates are now subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable standards. Moreover, HITECH creates a new requirement to report certain breaches of unsecured, individually identifiable health information and imposes penalties on entities that fail to do so. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
The 2013 final HITECH omnibus rule, or the HITECH Final Rule, modifies the breach reporting standard in a manner that makes more data security incidents qualify as reportable breaches. The costs of complying with privacy and security related legal and regulatory requirements are burdensome. The HITECH Final Rule will continue to be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us, as well as referring providers.
In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, several states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in certain cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws. Most states have also adopted breach notification laws that require notification to affected individuals and certain state agencies if there is a security breach of certain individually-identifiable information. If we suffer a privacy or security breach, we could be required to expend significant resources to provide notification to the affected individuals and address the breach, as well as reputational harm associated with the breach. If we fail to comply with applicable state laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions. Any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of HIPAA, HITECH or state privacy and security statutes or regulations could adversely affect our financial condition. The costs of complying with privacy and security related legal and regulatory requirements are burdensome and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Environmental Regulation 
Our research and development and manufacturing processes and operations may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including flammables, toxics and corrosives and produce hazardous chemical waste products. We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and end-of-life handling or disposition of products, and environmental protection, including those governing the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous materials. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct our operations. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. 
Foreign Government Regulation 
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign governmental regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain clearance or approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may be different. Many countries also impose product standards, packaging requirements, environmental requirements, labeling requirements, and import restrictions on medical devices. Each country has its own tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may subject a company to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, criminal prosecution or other consequences. 
The European Union is the primary regulator in Europe, which has adopted numerous directives/regulations and has promulgated standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, 

26




labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Medical devices that comply with the requirements of applicable directives/regulations will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms with the essential requirements of the applicable directives/regulations and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the member states of the European Union, and other countries that comply with or mirror these directives. We have the authorization to affix the CE Mark to our Flexitouch (classic) system to commercialize these devices in the European Union. The notified body who inspected us issued our initial ISO 13485 certification in October 2014 and our EC-Certificate in December 2014. 
In March 2012, we received our Medical Device License in Canada for our Flexitouch (classic) system and in June 2021 for our Flexitouch (Plus) system. In October 2021, we discontinued our Flexitouch (classic) system Medical Device License in Canada, but our Flexitouch (Plus) system License remains current as of the date of this filing. 

Third-Party Reimbursement
In the United States and elsewhere, sales of medical devices depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement to providers and patients from third-party payers. Third-party payers include private insurance plans and governmental programs. As with other medical devices, reimbursement for our products can differ significantly from payer to payer, and our products are not universally covered by third- party commercial payers. Further, third-party payers continually review existing technologies for continued coverage and can, with limited notice, deny or reverse coverage for existing products. 
 Two principal governmental third-party payers in the United States are Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare is a federal program that provides certain medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, certain disabled persons and others. In contrast, Medicaid is a medical assistance program jointly funded by federal and state governments to serve certain individuals and families with low incomes and who meet other eligibility requirements. Each state administers its own Medicaid program which determines the benefits made available to the Medicaid recipients in that state. The Medicare and Medicaid statutory framework is subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and discretion that affect the amount and timing of reimbursement made under Medicare and Medicaid. 
CMS, which is the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services that administers both Medicare and Medicaid, has the authority to decline to cover particular products or services if it determines that they are not "reasonable and necessary" for the treatment of Medicare beneficiaries. A coverage determination for a product, which establishes the indications that will be covered, and any restrictions or limitations, can be developed at the national level by CMS through a National Coverage Determination, or NCD, or at the local level through a Local Coverage Determination, or LCD, by a regional Medicare Administrative Contractor, which is a private contractor that processes and pays claims on behalf of CMS for the geographic area where the services were rendered. Obtaining a coverage determination, whether an NCD or LCD, is a time-consuming, expensive and highly uncertain endeavor, especially for a new device. Under a NCD that has been effective since January 14, 2002, pneumatic compression devices, or PCDs, including our products, are covered for the treatment of lymphedema or for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency with venous stasis ulcers. A LCD, administered by the four Medicare Administrative Contractors responsible for processing durable medical equipment claims, sets forth additional coverage criteria that impacts Medicare coverage for our products. Our Medicare business was 17% of revenue in 2021 compared to 16% in 2020.
Because Medicare criteria is extensive, we have a team dedicated to educating prescribers to help them understand how Medicare policy affects their patients and the medical record documentation needed to meet both NCD and LCD requirements. We maintain open communication with physician key opinion leaders and with Medicare contractors to provide data as it becomes available that could potentially influence coverage decisions. We also continue to closely monitor our Medicare business to identify trends that could have a negative impact on certain Medicare patients' access to our products, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
Commercial payers that reimburse for our products do so in a variety of ways, depending on the insurance plan's policies, employer and benefit manager input, and contracts with their provider network. Moreover, Medicaid programs and some commercial insurance plans, especially Medicare Advantage plans 

27




(commercial insurers that are administering Medicare benefits to certain beneficiaries), are frequently influenced by Medicare coverage determinations. In working with payers who follow Medicare criteria, we have focused on clear communications with insurers to ensure mutual understanding of criteria interpretation, which differs significantly among the plans from very restrictive to quite lenient, and we then work closely with prescribers to educate them accordingly. While this approach has had positive impact, we do not know if or when additional payers may adopt the LCD criteria nor do we know how they will choose to interpret it.
We believe a reduction or elimination of coverage or reimbursement of our products by Medicare would likely cause some commercial third-party payers to implement similar reductions in their coverage or reimbursement of our products. If we are unable to expand coverage of our products by additional commercial payers, or if third-party payers that currently cover or reimburse for our products reverse or limit their coverage or reimbursement levels in the future, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

Intellectual Property 
Our intellectual property consists of patented designs and methods and proprietary know-how. In addition to the patented designs and methods discussed below, we have made significant investments in proprietary know-how, including the manufacture of fabrics and garments used in our systems and the algorithms used to manage the inflation and deflation of our systems and other functions of the controllers. To maintain and protect our proprietary technologies and products, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, and confidentiality provisions in our contracts. We have a policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, third parties and our advisors to protect our intellectual property and maintain our competitive position. We also require our employees and consultants to sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interest in intellectual property such as patents and copyrights arising from their work for us. We also require all employees to sign an agreement not to compete unfairly with us during their employment and upon termination of their employment through the misuse of confidential information, soliciting employees, and soliciting customers. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our systems or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. 
Patents 
Our patent portfolio consists of three sets of patents, including patents relating to our Flexitouch system and other wearable compression-related technologies. As of December 31, 2021, we owned about 190 issued patents globally, of which 57 were issued U.S. patents. As of December 31, 2021, we owned about 39 pending patent applications pending globally, of which 15 were pending patent applications in the United States. Our U.S. issued patents have varying patent terms, expiring between 2022 and through at least 2040, subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges. U.S. patents covering various aspects of our Flexitouch system expired in 2017.
Trademarks 
We have registered the trademarks Tactile Medical, Flexitouch, the Flexitouch logo design, AffloVest, and AffloVest Pro with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register. We rely in the United States on common law rights to the Entre and Tactile Medical design trademarks and have applied to register the Tactile Medical trademark in Australia, China, the European Union and Japan.

Seasonality
Our business is affected by seasonality. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Seasonality.”

Human Capital Resources 
As a company, our focus is on developing and selling solutions that help increase clinical efficacy, reduce overall healthcare costs and improve the quality of life for patients with chronic conditions by treating 

28




them at home. We believe the strength of our employees is the cornerstone to achieving these goals. As of December 31, 2021, we had 988 employees. We have 537 employees who are based throughout the United States, as well as 451 employees who are primarily based in our corporate/manufacturing locations in the Minneapolis metropolitan area. Our employees are our most important resource and they set the foundation for our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. 
The success and growth of our business depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, retain and develop a diverse population of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization, including the individuals who comprise our workforce as well as executive officers and other key personnel. To succeed in a competitive labor market, we have developed key recruitment and retention strategies, objectives and measures that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies, objectives and measures form the pillars of our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following programs, policies and initiatives: 
​
Total Rewards: Rewarding and supporting our employees is essential to Company morale. To maintain a competitive salary and benefits package, we utilize an independent third party to evaluate employee compensation. We continue to explore and utilize benefits options in line with our growing and diverse workforce to attract and retain top talent. These benefits include but are not limited to retirement savings, an employee stock purchase plan, a variety of health insurance options, including dental and vision, discounts on healthy foods and fitness memberships, disability insurance, and paid maternity/paternity leave. Our Remote Work Policy also allows for a flexible work schedule and location, depending on business needs and the specific role. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: We consider diversity, equity, inclusion, and employee engagement as cornerstones to the future growth of the business. Our diverse and inclusive workplace encourages different perspectives and ideas, which we believe enables better business decisions and rapid innovation. We are committed to constructive and critical self-evaluation that leads to concrete steps that continually enhance and strengthen our corporate culture. Based on employee feedback, we have assessed our company practices and developed goals to guide our diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives including:
​

● | Increased diversity awareness programs for all areas of our organization; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increased focus on enhancing inclusiveness in our culture and understanding unintentional bias.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Fair Labor Practices: We seek fair labor practices throughout our business, including from our partners and key suppliers who share our values for human rights, dignity, and respect. We have implemented a Supplier Code of Conduct, requiring from our suppliers the same commitment to human rights, fair labor practices, and anticorruption that we value here at Tactile Medical. 
​
Health and Safety: The health and safety of our employees is a vital aspect to the success of the Company. We provide all employees training on workplace safety and require employees to follow standards and practices supporting a safe and healthy work environment. Our commitment to the health, safety, and wellness of employees, patients, and business partners alike can be demonstrated by our expedient COVID-19 response. We revamped our business processes to allow for social distancing, limited face-to-face interactions by operating virtually when able, and provided additional PPE for applicable employees while serving over 65,000 patients and avoiding employee lay-offs. 
Talent and Retention: In 2021, we focused on recruitment, hiring, and retention to ensure the highest quality talent and best fit for specific roles and the Company. Our recruitment efforts are expanding through strong recruiting and hiring processes and implementing an applicant tracking system. This applicant tracking system will support continuous improvement in our hiring process and will be leveraged for coaching and employee growth. We have also implemented a company intranet to facilitate employee inclusion, provide resources, and advance transparent communication efforts. 
 ​
The result of the culmination of the above is measured by our employee engagement. We annually participate in a survey conducted by a third party in conjunction with the Top Workplaces employer recognition award program. In 2021, our employees’ responses qualified Tactile Medical as a Top Workplace in Minnesota for the 12th year in a row.
