We also operate a leading business communications company (the “Media Group”) serving the multibillion-dollar adult nightclubs industry.

OUR BUSINESS 
 
We operate several businesses, which we aggregate for financial reporting into two reportable segments – Nightclubs and Bombshells – and combine other operating segments into “Other.”
 
Nightclubs
 
We operate our nightclubs through the following brands that target many different demographics of customers by providing a unique, quality entertainment environment. Our adult entertainment clubs do business as Rick’s Cabaret, Jaguar’s Club, Tootsie’s Cabaret, XTC Cabaret, Club Onyx, Hoops Cabaret and Sports Bar, Scarlett’s Cabaret, Temptations Adult Cabaret, Foxy’s Cabaret, Vivid Cabaret, Downtown Cabaret, Cabaret East, The Seville, Silver City Cabaret, and Kappa Men’s Club. We also operate dance clubs under the brand name Studio 80.
 
We generate revenue on our nightclubs through the sale of alcoholic beverages, food and merchandise items; service in the form of cover charge, dance fees, and room rentals; and through other related means such as ATM commissions and vending income, among others.
 
During fiscal 2018, Nightclub segment sales mix was 46% service revenue; 39% alcoholic beverages; and 15% food, merchandise and other, which had a segment gross margin (revenues less cost of goods sold) of approximately 88%.

In May 2018, we acquired a club in Kappa, Illinois for $1.5 million, financed by a $1.0 million seller note with interest at 8%. The acquisition included real estate valued at $825,000, other non-real-estate business assets worth $180,000, with goodwill from the acquisition amounting to $495,000. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for details of the transaction.
 
In September 2018, we acquired the remaining 49% interest in our joint venture partner for $1.55 million. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for details of the transaction.
 
In November 2018, subsequent to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we closed on the acquisition of one club in Chicago, Illinois and another club in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club in Chicago was acquired for a total consideration of $10.5 million with $6.0 million cash paid at closing and $4.5 million in a 6-year seller financed note with interest at 7%. The Pittsburgh club was acquired for a total consideration of $15.1 million, with $7.6 million cash paid at closing and two seller notes payable. The first note is a 2-year 7% note for $2.0 million, and the second is a 10-year 8% note for $5.5 million. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for details of the transactions.
 
A list of our nightclub locations is in Item 2— “Properties.”
 
Bombshells
 
As of September 30, 2018, we operated six Bombshells, all in Texas with one in Dallas, one in Austin and four in the Houston area. The restaurant concept sets itself apart with décor that pays homage to all branches of the U.S. military. Locations feature local DJs, large outdoor patios, and more than 75 state-of-the-art flat screen TVs for watching your favorite sports. All food and drink menu items have military names. Bombshell Girls, with their military-inspired uniforms, are a key attraction. Their mission, in addition to waitressing, is to interact with guests and generate a fun atmosphere. Bombshells is also open to franchising as our subsidiary, BMB Franchising Services, Inc. has received approval to sell franchises in all 50 states.
 
We opened the first Bombshells in March 2013 in Dallas, quickly becoming one of the most popular restaurant destinations in the area. Within five years, six more opened in the Austin and Houston, Texas areas. In September 2016, we closed one Bombshells location in Webster, Texas. Of the six currently active Bombshells, four are freestanding pad sites and two are inline locations.
 
During fiscal 2018, sales mix was 60% alcoholic beverages and 40% food, merchandise and other, which had a segment gross margin (revenues less cost of goods sold) of 75%.
 
For a list of our Bombshells locations, refer to Item 2—“Properties.”
 
Media Group
 
The Media Group, made up of wholly-owned subsidiaries, is the leading business communications company serving the multibillion-dollar adult nightclubs industry and the adult retail products industry. It owns a national industry convention and tradeshow; two national industry trade publications; two national industry award shows; and more than a dozen industry and social media websites. Included in the Media Group is ED Publications, publishers of the bimonthly ED Club Bulletin, the only national business magazine serving the 2,200-plus adult nightclubs in North America, which collectively have annual revenues in excess of $5 billion, according to the Association of Club Executives.

OUR STRATEGY
 
Our overall objective is to create value for our shareholders by developing and operating profitable businesses in the hospitality and related space. We strive to achieve that by providing an attractive price-value entertainment and dining experience; by attracting and retaining quality personnel; and by focusing on unit-level operating performance. Aside from our operating strategy, we employ a capital allocation strategy.
Capital Allocation Strategy
 
Our capital allocation strategy provides us with disciplined guidelines on how we should use our free cash flows; provided however, that we may deviate from this strategy if the circumstances warrant. We calculate free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities minus maintenance capital expenditures. Using the after-tax yield of buying our own stock as baseline, we believe we are able to make better investment decisions unless there is another strategic rationale, in management’s opinion.
 
Based on our current capital allocation strategy:
 

● | We consider buying back our own stock if the after-tax yield on free cash flow climbs over 10%; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We consider disposing of underperforming units to free up capital for more productive use; 
● | We consider acquiring or developing our own clubs or restaurants that we believe have the potential to provide a minimum cash on cash return of 25%-33%, absent an otherwise strategic rationale; 
● | We consider paying down our most expensive debt if it makes sense on a tax adjusted basis, or there is an otherwise strategic rationale. 

COMPETITION
 
The adult entertainment and the restaurant/sports bar businesses are highly competitive with respect to price, service and location. All of our nightclubs compete with a number of locally owned adult clubs, some of whose brands may have name recognition that equals that of ours. The names “Rick’s” and “Rick’s Cabaret,” “Tootsie’s Cabaret,” “XTC Cabaret,” “Scarlett’s,” “Silver City,” “Club Onyx,” “Downtown Cabaret,” “Temptations,” “The Seville,” “Jaguars,” “Hoops Cabaret,” and “Foxy’s Cabaret” are proprietary. In the restaurant/sports bar business, “Bombshells” is also proprietary. We believe that the combination of our existing brand name recognition and the distinctive entertainment environment that we have created allows us to compete effectively in the industry and within the cities where we operate. Although we believe that we are well positioned to compete successfully, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our high level of name recognition and prestige within the marketplace.
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business activities. Particularly in Texas, the authority to issue a permit to sell alcoholic beverages is governed by the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (“TABC”), which has the authority, in its discretion, to issue the appropriate permits. We presently hold a Mixed Beverage Permit and a Late Hour Permit at numerous Texas locations. Minnesota, North Carolina, Louisiana, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York, and Illinois have similar laws that may limit the availability of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages or that may provide for suspension or revocation of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages in certain circumstances. It is our policy, prior to expanding into any new market, to take steps to ensure compliance with all licensing and regulatory requirements for the sale of alcoholic beverages, as well as the sale of food.

In addition to various regulatory requirements affecting the sale of alcoholic beverages, in many cities where we operate, the location of an adult entertainment cabaret is subject to restriction by city, county or other governmental ordinance. The prohibitions deal generally with distance from schools, churches and other sexually oriented businesses, and contain restrictions based on the percentage of residences within the immediate vicinity of the sexually oriented business. The granting of a sexually oriented business permit is not subject to discretion; the permit must be granted if the proposed operation satisfies the requirements of the ordinance. In all states where we operate, management believes we are in compliance with applicable city, county, state or other local laws governing the sale of alcohol and sexually oriented businesses.
 
TRADEMARKS
 
Our rights to the trade names “RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc.,” “Rick’s,” “Rick’s Cabaret,” “Tootsie’s Cabaret,” “Club Onyx,” “XTC Cabaret,” “Temptations,” “Jaguars,” “Downtown Cabaret,” “Cabaret East,” Bombshells Restaurant and Bar,” and “Vee Lounge” are established under common law, based upon our substantial and continuous use of these trade names in interstate commerce, some of which have been in use at least as early as 1987. We have registered our service mark, “RICK’S AND STARS DESIGN,” and the “BOMBSHELLS RESTAURANT & BAR” logo design with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have also obtained service mark registrations from the Patent and Trademark Office for “RICK’S AND STARS DESIGN” logo, “RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.,” “RICKS,” “RICK’S CABARET,” “CLUB ONYX,” “XTC CABARET,” “SCARLETT’S CABARET,” “SILVER CITY CABARET,” “BOMBSHELLS RESTAURANT AND BAR”, “THE SEVILLE CLUB”, “DOWN IN TEXAS SALOON”, “CLUB DULCE”, “THE BLACK ORCHID”, “HOOPS CABARET”, “VEE LOUNGE,” “STUDIO 80”, “FOXY’S CABARET,” and “EXOTIC DANCER” are registered through service mark registrations issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. As of this date, we have pending registration applications for the name “TOOTSIES CABARET” We also own the rights to numerous trade names associated with our media division. There can be no assurance that these steps we have taken to protect our service marks will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our protected intellectual property rights.
EMPLOYEES AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS
 
As of September 30, 2018, we had approximately 2,050 employees, of which approximately 200 are in management positions, including corporate and administrative operations, and approximately 1,850 are engaged in entertainment, food and beverage service, including bartenders, waitresses, and certain entertainers. None of our employees are represented by a union. We consider our employee relations to be good. Additionally, as of September 30, 2018, we had independent contractor entertainers, who are self-employed and conduct business at our locations on a non-exclusive basis. Our entertainers at Rick’s Cabaret in Minneapolis, Minnesota and at Jaguars Club in Phoenix, Arizona act as commissioned employees. All employees and independent contractors sign arbitration non-class action participation agreements.
 
We believe that the adult entertainment industry standard of treating entertainers as independent contractors provides us with safe harbor protection to preclude payroll tax assessment for prior years. We have prepared plans that we believe will protect our profitability in the event that the sexually oriented business industry is required in all states to convert entertainers, who are now independent contractors, into employees. See related discussion in “Risk Factors.”
