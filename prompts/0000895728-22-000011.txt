ITEM 1. BUSINESS
We are a leading North American energy infrastructure company. We safely and reliably deliver the energy people need and want to fuel quality of life. Our core businesses include Liquids Pipelines, which transports approximately 30% of the crude oil produced in North America; Gas Transmission and Midstream, which transports approximately 20% of the natural gas consumed in the US; Gas Distribution and Storage, which serves approximately 75% of Ontario residents via approximately 3.8 million meter connections; and Renewable Power Generation, which generates approximately 1,766 megawatts (MW) of net renewable power in North America and Europe. Our common shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol ENB. We were incorporated on April 13, 1970 under the Companies Ordinance of the Northwest Territories and were continued under the Canada Business Corporations Act on December 15, 1987.
A more detailed description of each of our businesses and underlying assets is provided below under Business Segments.
CORPORATE VISION AND STRATEGY
VISION
Our primary purpose as a company is to fuel quality of life by providing the energy people need and want, in a safe, clean and socially responsible way. Our vision to be the leading energy infrastructure company in North America supports this purpose. In pursuing this vision, we play a critical role in enabling the economic and social well-being of people in the areas we serve who depend on access to affordable and reliable energy of all types. Our infrastructure franchises transport, distribute, and generate energy including liquids, natural gas, renewable power, and low-carbon fuels like Renewable Natural Gas (RNG). We recognize that the energy system is changing, and we aim to bridge to that cleaner energy future by investing in low-carbon platforms while ensuring the continuity and stability that the world requires through the transition.
Our investor value proposition is founded on our ability to deliver predictable cash flows and a growing stream of dividends year-over-year through investment in, and efficient operation of, energy infrastructure assets that are strategically positioned between key supply basins and strong demand-pull markets. Our assets are underpinned by long-term contracts, regulated cost-of-service tolling frameworks, power purchase agreements, and other low-risk commercial arrangements. 
We strive to be a leader in ESG; worker and public safety; emissions reduction; stakeholder relations; customer service; community investment; and employee engagement and satisfaction.
STRATEGY
An in-depth understanding of energy supply and demand fundamentals coupled with disciplined capital allocation principles has helped us become an industry leader supported by a diverse set of assets across the energy system. Our assets have reliably generated low-risk, resilient cash flows through many commodity and economic cycles, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing volatile economic recovery. 
To ensure we continue to be an industry leader and value creator going forward, we maintain a robust strategic planning approach. We regularly conduct scenario and resiliency analysis on both our assets and on our business strategy. We test various value enhancement and maximization options, and we engage regularly with our Board of Directors (Board) to ensure alignment and maintain active oversight. This Board participation includes updates and discussions throughout the year and a dedicated session to Strategy Planning annually. This comprehensive approach will continue to guide investment decisions moving forward.
Predictable growth is a hallmark of our investor value proposition. We see a 5-7% compound annual growth rate in distributable cash flow per share through 2024, relative to 2021, underpinned by opportunities to advance returns in our base business and grow organically through disciplined capital allocation. Our diversified footprint allows for selective investment in both our core businesses and in emerging low carbon energy platforms such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), hydrogen gas (H2), and RNG. 
In 2021, we progressed several of our strategic priorities. For example: 
•Our Liquids Pipelines team delivered record mainline throughput, placed $5.6 billion of capital into service (Line 3 Replacement, Southern Access), added 90 kbpd of system expansions into Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts (PADD) III, and acquired the Ingleside Energy Center in Corpus Christi and related assets which extends our reach into global light-oil export markets.
•Our Gas Transmission and Midstream business successfully placed $3.1 billion of capital into service, completed favorable rate settlements, which added $150 million of incremental EBITDA, and continued to advance more than $2 billion of expansion opportunities.
•Our Gas Distribution and Storage utility provided uninterrupted services during the ongoing pandemic, added over 40 thousand new customers, completed 190 modernization projects, placed two RNG projects into service, and completed an H2 blending pilot.
•In Europe, Renewable Power Generation advanced construction of the 480 MW Saint Nazaire project, the 500 MW Fécamp project, and the 448 MW Calvados project, and sanctioned the Provence Grand Large floating offshore wind facility.
•We advanced our self-power strategy and commissioned two projects, Alberta Solar One on our Liquids Pipeline system and Heidlersberg on our Gas Transmission system. Ten additional self-power facilities (~100MW) were approved for future development. 
•We established our New Energy Technologies team to advance our low-carbon strategy. Through several strategic partnerships, we are working to develop solutions in RNG, H2 and CCS and to accelerate global and industry-specific low-carbon objectives.
•We continued to make meaningful progress towards our ESG goals that include a 35% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity from our operations by 2030 (net zero GHG emissions by 2050) and increased representation of diverse groups within our workforce and the Board of Directors by 2025.
•We sold $1.2 billion of assets at attractive valuations, further strengthening our financial flexibility. In addition, we continued to reduce our operating costs ($1.2 billion since 2017), increasing our profitability and competitiveness.
These achievements are discussed in further detail in Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Looking ahead, our near-term strategic priorities remain similar to years past. As always, proactively advancing the safety of communities and assets, protecting the environment, and maintaining reliability will always be our top priorities. We are focused on enhancing the value of our existing assets in Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission and Midstream, Gas Distribution and Storage, and Renewable Power Generation.
We will continue to enhance base business returns, capitalize on our advantaged liquids and natural gas pipeline infrastructure, emphasizing export-driven opportunities and in-franchise organic growth, and developing low-carbon opportunities across our business. 
Our key strategic priorities are summarized below:
Ensure Safe Reliable Operations
Safety and operational reliability remain the foundation of our strategy. Our commitment to safety and operational reliability means achieving and maintaining industry leadership in safety (process, public and personal) and ensuring the reliability and integrity of the systems we operate, in order to generate, transport and deliver energy while protecting people and the environment. 
Enhance Returns from our Base Businesses
A key priority is to drive growth through an ongoing focus on optimization, productivity, and efficiency across all our businesses. Examples include: the application of drag-reducing agents and pump station horsepower additions to optimize throughput on our liquids system, the execution of toll settlements and rate case filings to optimize revenue within our gas transmission franchises, the expansion of low-carbon gas offerings to modernize and integrate value chains at our gas utility, and more generally, and the creation of sustainable cost savings across the organization through process improvement and/or system enhancements. 
Execute the Capital Program and Grow Core Business 
Successful project execution is integral to our financial performance and to the strategic positioning of our business over the long term. Our ongoing objective is to deliver our slate of secured projects (currently $9 billion through 2024) at the lowest practical cost while maintaining the highest standards for safety, quality, customer satisfaction and environmental and regulatory compliance. For a discussion of our current portfolio of capital projects, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects.
In seeking to extend growth, we expect to have sufficient self-funding capacity of about $5 to $6 billion per year to invest in new organic growth capital without issuing any additional common equity and maintaining key credit metrics. We will remain disciplined and deploy capital towards the best uses, prioritizing balance sheet strength, investment in low capital intensity growth and regulated utility or utility-like projects. We will carefully assess our remaining investable capacity, deploying capital to the most value-enhancing opportunities available to us, including further organic growth, asset acquisitions, and share buybacks, or further deleveraging our balance sheet.
Looking ahead, we see strong utilization of our existing network and opportunities for future growth within each of our businesses. For example:
•Our liquids pipelines infrastructure will remain a vital connection between key supply basins and demand-pull markets such as the refinery hubs in the US Midwest, Eastern Canada, and the US Gulf Coast. The emergence of CCS offers the potential to provide new growth opportunities over the long term.
•Our natural gas pipelines business will seek extension and expansion opportunities driven by new load demand from gas-fired power generation, industrial growth, and coastal liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants. Looking forward, blending RNG and H2 production projects into our system will enhance asset longevity and enable us to offer a differentiated low-carbon service to customers.
•Our gas distribution utility will continue to grow through customer additions, productivity enhancements, modernization investments and facilities that blend H2 and RNG into gas supply, and expansion of our demand-side management and distributed energy programs.
•Our mature capabilities in the offshore and onshore wind sector position us well to compete for new projects across the development cycle in Europe and North America, while our multi-year program to self-power existing pipeline compressor stations represents highly visible and scalable growth.
Maintain Financial Strength and Flexibility 
The maintenance of our financial strength is critical to our strategy. Our financing strategies are designed to retain strong investment-grade credit ratings to ensure that we have the financial capacity to meet our capital funding needs and the flexibility to manage capital market disruptions. Our current secured capital program, which extends to 2024, can be readily financed through internally generated cash flow and available balance sheet capacity without issuance of additional common equity and we will seek to secure new growth within our “self-funded” equity model. In addition, we continue to look at opportunities to monetize non-core assets at attractive valuations. For further discussion on our financing strategies, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Disciplined Capital Allocation 
We assess the latest fundamental trends, monitor the business landscape and proactively conduct business development activities with the goal of identifying an industry-leading opportunity set for capital deployment. Opportunities are screened, analyzed and assessed using a disciplined investment framework with the objective of ensuring effective deployment of capital to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns, while maintaining our low-risk “utility-like” business model.
All investment opportunities are evaluated based on their potential to advance our strategy, mitigate risk, support our ESG goals, and create additional financial flexibility. Our primary emphasis in the near term is on low capital-intensive opportunities to enhance returns in existing businesses (organic expansions and optimizations), modernization of our systems and utility rate-based investments. Execution risk remains high for large scale, long-duration development projects and, therefore, our focus will be on projects where we can carefully manage at-risk capital during the permitting and construction phases. 
In evaluating typical investment opportunities, we also consider other potential capital allocation alternatives. Other alternatives for capital deployment depend on our current outlook and include further dividend increases, further debt reduction, and/or share re-purchases. 
Adapt to Energy Transition Over Time
As the global population grows and standards of living continue to improve around the world, more energy will be needed. At the same time, our society increasingly recognizes the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on the world’s climate. Accordingly, energy systems are being reshaped as industry participants, regulators and consumers seek to lower emissions. As a diversified energy infrastructure company, we are well positioned to play a key role in the transition to a low-emissions economy by leading the development of the future energy systems and partnering with customers on their low-carbon strategies, while at the same time working to reduce our own emissions. Furthermore, we have tested our assets for various energy transition scenarios and concluded that they are highly resilient and can be relied upon for stable cash flow generation well into the future.
We believe that diversification and innovation will play a significant role in the transition to a low-carbon future. To date, we have made large investments in natural gas infrastructure and continue to see significant opportunity in renewable energy. Our focus areas in renewable energy remain in offshore wind and utility-scale onshore projects. We are also taking a leadership role in other low-carbon platforms like CCS, H2 and RNG where we can leverage our infrastructure capability and stakeholder relationships to accelerate growth and extend the value of our existing assets. Additionally, all new investments that we make will need to have a clear path to achieve net zero emissions.
We recognize our customer's expectations of a transition to a lower-carbon economy and are working actively to be a differentiated service provider by leveraging our ESG leadership and world-class execution capabilities. 
STRATEGIC ENABLERS
Our success in executing on our strategic priorities is enabled by our commitment to ESG, the quality and capabilities of our people, and the extent to which we embrace technology and innovation as a competitive advantage.
ESG
Sustainability is integral to our ability to safely and reliably deliver the energy people need and want. How well we perform as a steward of our environment; as a safe operator of essential energy infrastructure; as a diverse and inclusive employer; and as a responsible corporate citizen is inextricably linked to our ability to achieve our strategic priorities and create long-term value for all stakeholders. 
Our commitment to strong ESG practices and performance has long been core to how we do business and we are proud to be recognized as a leader amongst our peers. In 2020, we set out ambitious goals1 including:
•Net zero GHG emissions by 2050 with an interim target to reduce GHG emissions intensity 35% by 2030 compared to the 2018 baseline.
•Increased representation of diverse groups within our workforce by 2025, including representation goals of 40% women and 28% racial and ethnic groups, along with new initiatives to enhance supplier diversity.
•Strengthening diversity on our Board with representation goals of 40% women and 20% racial and ethnic groups by 2025.
•Annual safety and reliability targets that drive continuous improvement towards our goal of zero incidents, injuries, and implementation of robust cyber defense programs.
Beginning in 2021, we began linking ESG performance to incentive compensation and are making meaningful progress toward these targets by executing on specific action plans. In addition, we issued our first sustainability-linked loan and sustainability-linked bond that ties our financing to our ESG goals. 
1 All percentages or specific goals regarding inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility are aspirational goals which we intend to achieve in a manner compliant with state, local, provincial and federal law, including, but not limited to, US federal regulations, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Department of Labor and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
Enbridge aims to continuously strengthen its approach to emissions reporting and reduction and is expanding its approach to include the following additional actions:
•Ensure that investment decision making aligns with Enbridge’s interim and long-term emissions reduction goals.
•Continue to proactively work with the organizations developing science-based guidelines for emissions targets in the midstream sector.
•Work with key suppliers to support the further reduction of Scope 3 emissions.
•Further develop low carbon energy partnerships to drive innovation across our business, with a focus on renewable power, renewable natural gas, hydrogen and carbon capture.
Achieving our goals will put us in a better position to successfully transition to a low-carbon, more diverse, and inclusive future.
People
Our employees are essential to our long-term success and enhancing the capability of our people to maximize their potential is a key area of focus. We value diversity, and diverse thought, and have embedded inclusive practices in our programs and approach to people management. Furthermore, we strive to maintain industry competitive compensation, flexibility, and retention programs that provide both short-term and long-term performance incentives.

We’re committed to pursuing innovation and technology solutions that further improve our safety performance, maximize revenues, improve efficiencies, and enable transition to new, cleaner energy solutions. Our two Technology and Innovation labs, located in Calgary and Houston, embody our commitment to technology enabled business solutions. Leveraging the benefits of technology to contribute to safety, reliability and the profitability of assets has become entrenched in our everyday operations.
We provide annual progress updates related to the above initiatives, along with our assumptions and other relevant information, in our annual Sustainability Report which can be found at https://www.enbridge.com/sustainability-reports. Unless otherwise specifically stated, none of the information contained on, or connected to, the Enbridge website, including our annual Sustainability Report, is incorporated by reference in, or otherwise part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Our activities are carried out through five business segments: Liquids Pipelines; Gas Transmission and Midstream; Gas Distribution and Storage; Renewable Power Generation; and Energy Services, as discussed below.
LIQUIDS PIPELINES
Liquids Pipelines consists of pipelines and terminals in Canada and the US that transport and export various grades of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons.
MAINLINE SYSTEM
The Mainline System is comprised of the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System. The Canadian Mainline is a common carrier pipeline system which transports various grades of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons within western Canada and from western Canada to the Canada/US border near Gretna, Manitoba and Neche, North Dakota and from the US/Canada border near Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario to eastern Canada and the northeastern US. The Canadian Mainline includes six adjacent pipelines with a combined operating capacity of approximately 3.1 million barrels per day (mmbpd) that connect with the Lakehead System at the Canada/US border, as well as five pipelines that deliver crude oil and refined products into eastern Canada and the northeastern US. We have operated, and frequently expanded, the Canadian Mainline since 1949. The Lakehead System is the portion of the Mainline System in the US. It is an interstate common carrier pipeline system regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and is the primary transporter of crude oil and liquid petroleum from western Canada to the US.
Tolling Framework
The Competitive Toll Settlement (CTS) which governed tolls paid for products shipped on the Canadian Mainline, with the exception of Lines 8 and 9 which are tolled on a separate basis, expired on June 30, 2021. The CTS was a 10-year negotiated agreement and provided for a Canadian Local Toll (CLT) for deliveries within western Canada, as well as an International Joint Tariff (IJT) for crude oil shipments originating in western Canada, on the Canadian Mainline, and delivered into the US, via the Lakehead System, and into eastern Canada. The IJT tolls were denominated in US dollars. 
On December 19, 2019, we submitted an application to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) to implement contracting on our Canadian Mainline System. On November 26, 2021, the CER denied the application on the basis that, among other things, contracting as proposed would result in a significant change to access the Canadian Mainline and potentially inequitable outcomes to some shippers and non-shippers without a compelling justification.
Effective July 1, 2021, the Mainline System is on Interim Tolls which will remain in effect until new tolls are approved by the CER. In accordance with the terms of the CTS, Interim Tolls are equal to the CTS exit tolls on June 30, 2021 and are subject to finalization and adjustment applicable to the interim period, if any. We are currently exploring, with customers and other stakeholders, alternatives that may include: a modified and extended CTS, a new incentive rate-making agreement, or a cost-of-service rate-making structure. Any negotiated settlement would require CER approval before implementation. New tolling framework clarity is expected by 2023. 
Shippers continue to nominate volumes on a monthly basis and we continue to allocate capacity to maximize the efficiency of the Mainline System. 
Local tolls for service on the Lakehead System are not affected by Interim Tolls and continue to be established pursuant to the Lakehead System’s existing toll agreements, as described below. Under Interim Tolls, the Canadian Mainline’s share of the toll relating to pipeline transportation of a batch from any western Canada receipt point to the US border is equal to the toll applicable to that batch’s US delivery point less the Lakehead System’s local toll to that delivery point. While on Interim Tolls, we will continue to refer to this amount as the Canadian Mainline IJT Residual Benchmark Toll which is denominated in US dollars.
Lakehead System Local Tolls
Transportation rates are governed by the FERC for deliveries from the Canada/US border near Neche, North Dakota, Clearbrook, Minnesota and other points to principal delivery points on the Lakehead System. The Lakehead System periodically adjusts these transportation rates as allowed under the FERC’s index methodology and tariff agreements, the main components of which are index rates and the Facilities Surcharge Mechanism. Index rates, the base portion of the transportation rates for the Lakehead System, are subject to an annual inflationary adjustment which cannot exceed established ceiling rates as approved by the FERC. The Facilities Surcharge Mechanism allows the Lakehead System to recover costs associated with certain shipper-requested projects through an incremental surcharge in addition to the existing base rates and is subject to annual adjustment on April 1 of each year. To the extent that the Lakehead System transportation rates materially under-recover the Lakehead System cost of service, an application can be made with the FERC to seek approval to increase the rates in order to bring recoveries in-line with costs.
On May 21, 2021, we filed a cost-of-service application to raise our base rates effective July 1, 2021. On June 30, 2021, the FERC issued an order to accept the rates subject to refund. This matter is currently in the FERC settlement process.
REGIONAL OIL SANDS SYSTEM
The Regional Oil Sands System includes five intra-Alberta long-haul pipelines; the Athabasca Pipeline, Waupisoo Pipeline, Woodland Pipeline, Wood Buffalo Extension/Athabasca Twin pipeline system and the Norlite Pipeline System (Norlite), as well as two large terminals: the Athabasca Terminal located north of Fort McMurray, Alberta and the Cheecham Terminal, located south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Regional Oil Sands System also includes numerous laterals and related facilities which currently provide access for oil sands production from twelve producing oil sands projects.
The combined capacity of the intra-Alberta long-haul pipelines is approximately 1,090 kbpd to Edmonton and 1,370 kbpd into Hardisty, with Norlite providing approximately 218 kbpd of diluent capacity into the Fort McMurray region. We have a 50% interest in the Woodland Pipeline and a 70% interest in Norlite. The Regional Oil Sands System is anchored by long-term agreements with multiple oil sands producers that provide cash flow stability and also include provisions for the recovery of some of the operating costs of this system.
GULF COAST AND MID-CONTINENT
Gulf Coast includes Seaway Crude Pipeline System (Seaway Pipeline), Flanagan South Pipeline (Flanagan South), Spearhead Pipeline, Gray Oak Pipeline and the Enbridge Ingleside Energy Center (EIEC), as well as the Mid-Continent System (Cushing Terminal).
We have a 50% interest in the 1,078-kilometer (670-mile) Seaway Pipeline, including the 805-kilometer (500-mile), 30-inch diameter long-haul system between Cushing, Oklahoma and Freeport, Texas, as well as the Texas City Terminal and Distribution System which serve refineries in the Houston and Texas City areas. Total aggregate capacity on the Seaway Pipeline system is approximately 950 kbpd. Seaway Pipeline also includes 8.8 million barrels of crude oil storage tank capacity on the Texas Gulf Coast.
Flanagan South is a 950-kilometer (590-mile), 36-inch diameter interstate crude oil pipeline that originates at our terminal at Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, and terminates in Cushing, Oklahoma. Flanagan South has a capacity of approximately 600 kbpd.
Spearhead Pipeline is a long-haul pipeline that delivers crude oil from Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, to Cushing, Oklahoma. The Spearhead pipeline has a capacity of approximately 193 kbpd.
The Gray Oak pipeline is a 1,368-kilometer (850-mile) crude oil system, which runs from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the US Gulf Coast. The Gray Oak pipeline has an expected average annual capacity of 900 kbpd and transports light crude oil. We have an effective 22.8% interest in the pipeline. Initial in-service for the pipeline commenced in November 2019 with full service achieved in the second quarter of 2020.
The Mid-Continent System is comprised of storage terminals at Cushing, Oklahoma (Cushing Terminal), consisting of over 80 individual storage tanks ranging in size from 78 to 570 thousand barrels. Total storage shell capacity of Cushing Terminal is approximately 20 million barrels. A portion of the storage facilities are used for operational purposes, while the remainder are contracted to various crude oil market participants for their term storage requirements. Contract fees include fixed monthly storage fees, throughput fees for receiving and delivering crude to and from connecting pipelines and terminals, as well as blending fees.
In October 2021, we acquired a 100 percent operating interest in the Ingleside Energy Center (renamed the Enbridge Ingleside Energy Center (EIEC)), located near Corpus Christi, Texas. This terminal is comprised of 15.6 million barrels of storage and 1.5 million barrels per day of export capacity. We also acquired a 20% interest in the 670-kbpd Cactus II Pipeline, a 100% interest in the 300-kbpd Viola pipeline, and a 100% interest in the 350-thousand-barrel Taft Terminal.
OTHER
Other includes Southern Lights Pipeline, Express-Platte System, Bakken System and Feeder Pipelines and Other.
Southern Lights Pipeline is a single stream 180 kbpd 16/18/20-inch diameter pipeline that ships diluent from the Manhattan Terminal near Chicago, Illinois to three western Canadian delivery facilities, located at the Edmonton and Hardisty terminals in Alberta and the Kerrobert terminal in Saskatchewan. Both the Canadian portion of Southern Lights Pipeline and the US portion of Southern Lights Pipeline receive tariff revenues under long-term contracts with committed shippers. Southern Lights Pipeline capacity is 90% contracted with the remaining 10% of the capacity assigned for shippers to ship uncommitted volumes.
The Express-Platte System consists of the Express pipeline and the Platte pipeline, and crude oil storage of approximately 5.6 million barrels. It is an approximate 2,736-kilometer (1,700-mile) long crude oil transportation system, which begins at Hardisty, Alberta, and terminates at Wood River, Illinois. The 310 kbpd Express pipeline carries crude oil to US refining markets in the Rocky Mountains area, including Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah. The 145 to 164 kbpd Platte pipeline, which interconnects with the Express pipeline at Casper, Wyoming, transports crude oil predominantly from the Bakken shale and western Canada to refineries in the midwest. Express pipeline capacity is typically committed under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers. A small portion of Express pipeline capacity and all of the Platte pipeline capacity is used by uncommitted shippers who pay only for the pipeline capacity they actually use in a given month.
The Bakken System consists of the North Dakota System and the Bakken Pipeline System. The North Dakota System services the Bakken in North Dakota and is comprised of a crude oil gathering and interstate pipeline transportation system. The gathering system provides delivery to Clearbrook, Minnesota for service on the Lakehead system or a variety of interconnecting pipeline and rail export facilities. The interstate portion of the system has both US and Canadian components that extend from Berthold, North Dakota into Cromer, Manitoba.
Tariffs on the US portion of the North Dakota System are governed by the FERC. The Canadian portion is categorized as a Group 2 pipeline, and as such, its tolls are regulated by the CER on a complaint basis. Tolls on the interstate pipeline system are based on long-term take-or-pay agreements with anchor shippers.
We have an effective 27.6% interest in the Bakken Pipeline System, which connects the Bakken formation in North Dakota to markets in eastern PADD II and the US Gulf Coast. The Bakken Pipeline System consists of the DAPL from the Bakken area in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois, and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline from Patoka, Illinois to Nederland, Texas. Current capacity is 750 kbpd of crude oil with the potential to be expanded through additional pumping horsepower. The Bakken Pipeline System is anchored by long-term throughput commitments from a number of producers.
Feeder Pipelines and Other includes a number of liquids storage assets and pipeline systems in Canada and the US.
Key assets included in Feeder Pipelines and Other are the Hardisty Contract Terminal and Hardisty Storage Caverns located near Hardisty, Alberta, a key crude oil pipeline hub in western Canada and the Southern Access Extension (SAX) pipeline which originates in Flanagan, Illinois and delivers to Patoka, Illinois. We have an effective 65% interest in the 300 kbpd SAX pipeline of which the majority of its capacity is commercially secured under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers.
Feeder Pipelines and Other also includes Patoka Storage, the Toledo pipeline system and the Norman Wells (NW) System. Patoka Storage is comprised of four storage tanks with 480 thousand barrels of shell capacity located in Patoka, Illinois. The 101 kbpd Toledo pipeline system connects with the Lakehead System and delivers to Ohio and Michigan. The 45 kbpd NW System transports crude oil from Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories to Zama, Alberta and has a cost-of-service rate structure based on established terms with shippers.
COMPETITION
Competition to our liquids pipelines network comes primarily from infrastructure or logistics alternatives that transport liquid hydrocarbons from production basins in, which we operate, to markets in Canada, the US and internationally. Competition from existing and proposed pipelines is based primarily on access to supply, end use markets, the cost of transportation, contract structure and the quality and reliability of service. Additionally, volatile crude price differentials and insufficient pipeline capacity on either our or competitors' pipelines can make transportation of crude oil by rail competitive, particularly to markets not currently served by pipelines.
We believe that our liquids pipelines systems will continue to provide competitive and attractive options to producers in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB), North Dakota, and more recently the Permian Basin, due to our market access, competitive tolls and flexibility through our multiple delivery and storage points. We also employ long-term agreements with shippers, which mitigates competition risk by ensuring consistent supply to our liquids pipelines network. Our current complement of growth projects to expand market access and to enhance capacity on our pipeline system will provide additional competitive solutions for liquids transportation. We have a proven track record of successfully executing projects to meet the needs of our customers.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND
We have an established and successful history of being the largest transporter of crude oil to the US, the world’s largest market for crude oil. While US demand for Canadian crude oil production will support the use of our infrastructure for the foreseeable future, North American and global crude oil supply and demand fundamentals are shifting, and we have a role to play in this transition by developing long-term transportation options that enable the efficient flow of crude oil from supply regions to end-user markets, both domestic and global.
The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on the crude oil market in 2020 with decreased demand from the economic slowdown and government imposed mobility restrictions. However, 2021 has seen global crude oil demand recover to levels close to pre-pandemic highs. International prices have strengthened to multi-year highs as global demand has outpaced the return of supply as publicly traded producers have adopted a more disciplined approach to capital allocation for new drilling.

Our Mainline System throughput, as measured at the Canada/US border at Gretna, Manitoba ended the year delivering 3.1 million barrels per day, as the Line 3 Replacement program has come into service. Refinery demand in the upper Midwest PADD II market has been strong given the economic recovery and enhanced mobility demand. On the US Gulf Coast, lower supply of heavy crude from Latin America and the Middle East is driving increased demand for Canadian heavy crude.

Global crude oil demand in most base case forecasts is expected to grow into the next decade, primarily driven by emerging economies in regions outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), such as India and China. In North America, demand growth for transportation fuels is expected to moderate over time due to vehicle fuel efficiency improvement and increasing sales of electric vehicles.
New supply to meet this growing demand will primarily come from Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) countries and North America. Growth in supply from OPEC will be led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with their significant low cost reserves and could be supplemented by the return of sanctioned Iranian production. Growth in North America will be driven by the Permian Basin which is a large and cost competitive light crude oil resource base. In addition, heavy crude oil growth is expected from the WCSB as additional egress availability will support expansion of existing projects and some potential new greenfield facilities.
The combination of long term demand growth in non-OECD nations, domestic demand contraction over time, and continued production growth in the Permian Basin and WCSB highlights the importance of our strategic asset footprint and reinforces the need for additional export oriented infrastructure. We are well positioned to meet these evolving supply and demand fundamentals through expansion of system capacity for incremental access to the US Gulf Coast, and through further development of our new Enbridge Ingleside Energy Center in Corpus Christi, the largest crude oil export facility in North America.
Opposition to fossil fuel development in conjunction with evolving consumer preferences and new technology could underpin accelerated energy transition scenarios impacting long term supply and demand of crude oil. We continue to closely monitor the evolution of all of these factors to be able to pro-actively adapt our business to help meet our customers’ and society’s energy needs.
Progress on the development and construction of our commercially secured growth projects is discussed in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects.

Transmission and storage services are generally provided under firm agreements where customers reserve capacity in pipelines and storage facilities. The vast majority of these agreements provide for fixed reservation charges that are paid monthly regardless of the actual volumes transported on the pipelines, plus a small variable component that is based on volumes transported, injected or withdrawn, which is intended to recover variable costs.
Interruptible transmission and storage services are also available where customers can use capacity if it exists at the time of the request and are generally at a higher toll than long-term contracted rates. Interruptible revenues depend on the amount of volumes transported or stored and the associated rates for this service. Storage operations also provide a variety of other value-added services including natural gas parking, loaning and balancing services to meet customers’ needs.
CANADIAN GAS TRANSMISSION
Canadian Gas Transmission is comprised of Westcoast Energy Inc.’s (Westcoast) British Columbia (BC) Pipeline, Alliance Pipeline and other minor midstream gas gathering pipelines.

OTHER
Other consists primarily of our offshore assets. Enbridge Offshore Pipelines is comprised of 11 natural gas gathering and FERC regulated transmission pipelines and four oil pipelines. These pipelines are located in four major corridors in the Gulf of Mexico, extending to deepwater developments, and include almost 2,100-kilometers (1,300-miles) of underwater pipe and onshore facilities with total capacity of approximately 6.5 bcf/d.
COMPETITION
Our natural gas transmission and storage businesses compete with similar facilities that serve our supply and market areas in the transmission and storage of natural gas. The principal elements of competition are location, rates, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service.
The natural gas transported in our business competes with other forms of energy available to our customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane, fuel oils, nuclear and renewable energy. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, levels of business activity, long-term economic conditions, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels, weather and other factors.
Competition exists in all markets that our businesses serve. Competitors include interstate/interprovincial and intrastate/intraprovincial pipelines or their affiliates and other midstream businesses that transport, gather, treat, process and market natural gas or NGLs. Because pipelines are generally the most efficient mode of transportation for natural gas over land, the most significant competitors of our natural gas pipelines are other pipeline companies.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND
Our gas transmission assets make up one of the largest natural gas transportation networks in North America, driving connectivity between prolific supply basins and major demand centers within the continent. Our systems have been integral to the transition in supply and demand markets over the last decade and will continue to play a part as the energy landscape evolves. 
In 2010, natural gas production in each of the Appalachian and Permian basins were less than 5.0 bcf/d each. Today, these regions produce more than 47.5 bcf/d of natural gas on a combined basis. Improved technology and increased shale gas drilling have increased the supply of low-cost natural gas. As well, there has been and continues to be a corresponding increase in demand for our natural gas infrastructure in North America. Through a series of expansions and reversals on our core systems, combined with the execution of greenfield projects and strategic acquisitions, we have been able to meet the needs of producers and consumers alike. Our US Gas Transmission systems were initially designed to transport natural gas from the Gulf Coast to the supply starved northeast markets. Our asset base now has the capability to transport diverse bi-directional supply to the northeast, southeast, midwest, Gulf Coast and LNG markets on a fully subscribed and highly utilized basis.
The northeast market continues its role as a predominantly supply constrained region with steady demand. The bi-directional capabilities offered by our US Gas Transmission system allows us to deliver in an efficient manner to our regional customers. The region has seen an increase in natural gas supply due to the development of the Marcellus and Utica shales in the Appalachia region.
The southeast market is linked to multiple, highly liquid supply pools that include the Marcellus and Utica shale developments, offering consistent supply and stable pricing to a growing population of end-use customers across our multiple systems under long term, utility-like arrangements.
With connectivity to Appalachian and western Canadian supply through our systems, the midwest market has access to two of the lowest cost gas producing regions on the continent. As demand in the region is expected to continue to grow by approximately 2.0 bcf/d over the next two decades, maintaining this link will remain important. Flexibility in supply for this market is especially critical to maintaining liquidity and price stability as natural gas continues to replace coal-fired generation.
Gulf Coast demand growth is being driven by an increase in the volume of LNG exports, an ongoing wave of gas-intensive petrochemical facilities, along with power generation and additional pipeline exports to Mexico. Demand to these markets in the region is anticipated to grow by more than 23.0 bcf/d through 2040. The Gulf Coast market has been the beneficiary of low cost capacity on our assets as the relationship between supply and market centers has shifted. Such cost-effective capacity is difficult to access or replicate, offering existing shippers and transporters stability of capacity and utilization. Tide-water market access and proximity to Mexico continue to make this region a platform of global trade as pipeline and LNG exports continue their growth trajectory. The US exported over 11 bcf/d of natural gas to LNG markets, primarily from the Gulf Coast region, at the end of 2021.
Western Canada, not unlike other supply hubs, is a source of low-cost supply seeking access to premium markets in North America and globally. One of the few vital links to demand centers in the pacific northwest are our own systems in the region, which are highly utilized.
Global energy demand is expected to increase approximately 27% by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency, driven primarily by economic growth in non-OECD countries. Natural gas will play an important role in meeting this energy demand as gas consumption is anticipated to grow by approximately 23% during this period as one of the world’s fastest growing energy sources. North American exports will play a significant part in meeting global demand, underscoring the ability of our assets to remain highly utilized by shippers, and highlighting the need for incremental transportation solutions across North America. In response to these global fundamentals, we believe we are well positioned to provide value-added solutions to shippers. Opposition to natural gas development, including new pipeline projects, has been increasing in recent years. This may challenge continued growth of the North American gas market and the ability to efficiently connect supply and demand. We are responding to the need for regional infrastructure with additional investments in Canadian and US gas transportation facilities. Progress on the development and construction of our commercially secured growth projects is discussed in Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects.
GAS DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE
Gas Distribution and Storage consists of our natural gas utility operations, the core of which is Enbridge Gas Inc. (Enbridge Gas), which serves residential, commercial and industrial customers throughout Ontario. This business segment also includes natural gas distribution activities in Québec and previously included an investment in Noverco Inc. (Noverco) which was sold on December 30, 2021. Please refer to Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary data - Note 8 - Acquisitions and Dispositions for further details.
ENBRIDGE GAS 
Enbridge Gas is a rate-regulated natural gas distribution utility with storage and transmission services that has been in operation for 173 years. Enbridge Gas serves approximately 75% of Ontario residents via approximately 3.8 million residential, commercial and industrial meter connections.
There are three principal interrelated aspects of the natural gas distribution business in which Enbridge Gas is directly involved: Distribution, Transportation and Storage.
In 2021, Enbridge Gas implemented a voluntary RNG pilot program, whereby customers can voluntarily contribute towards the incremental cost of low carbon RNG to displace regular natural gas, and a pilot project which allows regular natural gas to be blended with H2, in an isolated portion of the existing distribution system, in an effort to gain insight into the use of H2 as a method for decarbonizing natural gas for the purpose of reducing GHG emissions. 
Distribution
Enbridge Gas’ principal source of revenue arises from distribution of natural gas to customers. The services provided to residential, small commercial and industrial heating customers are primarily on a general service basis, without a specific fixed term or fixed price contract. The services provided to larger commercial and industrial customers are usually on an annual contract basis under firm or interruptible service contracts. Under a firm contract, Enbridge Gas is obligated to deliver natural gas to the customer up to a maximum daily volume. The service provided under an interruptible contract is similar to that of a firm contract, except that it allows for service interruption at Enbridge Gas’ option primarily to meet seasonal or peak demands. The Ontario Energy Board (OEB) approves rates for both contract and general services. The distribution system consists of approximately 147,000-kilometers (91,342-miles) of pipelines that carry natural gas from the point of local supply to customers.
Customers have a choice with respect to natural gas supply. Customers may purchase and deliver their own natural gas to points upstream of the distribution system or directly into Enbridge Gas’ distribution system, or, alternatively, they may choose a system supply option, whereby customers purchase natural gas from Enbridge Gas’ supply portfolio. To acquire the necessary volume of natural gas to serve its customers, Enbridge Gas maintains a diversified natural gas supply portfolio, acquiring supplies on a delivered basis in Ontario, as well as acquiring supply from multiple supply basins across North America.
Transportation
Enbridge Gas contracts for firm transportation service, primarily with TransCanada Pipelines Limited (TransCanada), Vector and NEXUS, to meet its annual natural gas supply requirements. The transportation service contracts are not directly linked with any particular source of natural gas supply. Separating transportation contracts from natural gas supply allows Enbridge Gas flexibility in obtaining its own natural gas supply and accommodating the requests of its direct purchase customers for assignment of TransCanada capacity. Enbridge Gas forecasts the natural gas supply needs of its customers, including the associated transportation and storage requirements.
In addition to contracting for transportation service, Enbridge Gas offers firm and interruptible transportation services on its own Dawn-Parkway pipeline system. Enbridge Gas’ transmission system consists of approximately 5,500-kilometers (3,418-miles) of high-pressure pipeline and five mainline compressor stations and has an effective peak daily demand capacity of 7.6 bcf/d. Enbridge Gas’ transmission system also links an extensive network of underground storage pools at the Tecumseh Gas Storage facility and Dawn Hub (collectively, Dawn) to major Canadian and US markets, and forms an important link in moving natural gas from western Canada and US supply basins to central Canadian and northeastern US markets.
As the supply of natural gas in areas close to Ontario continues to grow, there is an increased demand to access these diverse supplies at Dawn and transport them along the Dawn-Parkway pipeline system to markets in Ontario, eastern Canada and the northeastern US. Enbridge Gas delivered 1,943 bcf of gas through its distribution and transmission system in 2021. A substantial amount of Enbridge Gas’ transportation revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges, with the average length of a long-term contract being approximately 15 years and the longest remaining contract term being 19 years.
Storage
Enbridge Gas’ business is highly seasonal as daily market demand for natural gas fluctuates with changes in weather, with peak consumption occurring in the winter months. Utilization of storage facilities permits Enbridge Gas to take delivery of natural gas on favorable terms during off-peak summer periods for subsequent use during the winter heating season. This practice permits Enbridge Gas to minimize the annual cost of transportation of natural gas from its supply basins, assists in reducing its overall cost of natural gas supply and adds a measure of security in the event of any short-term interruption of transportation of natural gas to Enbridge Gas’ franchise areas.
Enbridge Gas’ storage facility at Dawn is located in southwestern Ontario, and has a total working capacity of approximately 281 bcf in 34 underground facilities located in depleted gas fields. Dawn is the largest integrated underground storage facility in Canada and one of the largest in North America. Approximately 180 bcf of the total working capacity is available to Enbridge Gas for utility operations. Enbridge Gas also has storage contracts with third parties for 21 bcf of storage capacity.
Dawn offers customers an important link in the movement of natural gas from western Canadian and US supply basins to markets in central Canada and the northeast US. Dawn's configuration provides flexibility for injections, withdrawals and cycling. Customers can purchase both firm and interruptible storage services at Dawn. Dawn offers customers a wide range of market choices and options with easy access to upstream and downstream markets. During 2021, Dawn provided services such as storage, balancing, gas loans, transport, exchange and peaking services to over 200 counterparties.
A substantial amount of Enbridge Gas’ storage revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges, with the average length of a long-term contract being approximately four years and the longest remaining contract term being 15 years.
NOVERCO
Noverco is a holding company that wholly-owns Énergir, LP (Énergir), formerly known as Gaz Metro Limited Partnership, a natural gas distribution company operating in Québec, with interests in subsidiary companies operating gas transmission, gas distribution and power distribution businesses in Québec and Vermont. Énergir serves approximately 525,000 residential and industrial customers and is regulated by the Québec Régie de l’énergie and the Vermont Public Utility Commission. Noverco also holds an investment in our common shares. We owned an equity interest in Noverco through ownership of 38.9% of its common shares and an investment in its preferred shares. On December 30, 2021, we sold our 38.9% non-operating minority ownership interest in Noverco to Trencap L.P. for $1.1 billion in cash. 
GAZIFÈRE
We wholly own Gazifère, a natural gas distribution company that serves approximately 44,000 customers in western Québec, a market not served by Énergir. Gazifère is regulated by the Québec Régie de l’énergie.
COMPETITION
Enbridge Gas’ distribution system is regulated by the OEB and is subject to regulation in a number of areas, including rates. Enbridge Gas is not generally subject to third-party distribution competition within its franchise areas.
Enbridge Gas competes with other forms of energy available to its customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane and fuel oils. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include weather, price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation including the federal carbon pricing law, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels and other factors.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND
We expect that demand for natural gas in North America will continue to see steady annual growth over the long term with continued growth in peak day demands, however there are risks to the natural gas market that may challenge its growth prospects. Evolving customer preferences for lower-carbon fuels and more efficient technologies, combined with increasing opposition to natural gas development in North America, may reduce the markets’ ability to efficiently deploy capital to connect supply and demand. We monitor these factors closely to be able to develop our business strategy to align with shifts in customer preferences.
We expect demand for natural gas connections in Ontario to maintain its recent growth profile due to continued population growth and with competitively priced natural gas expected to continue to provide a significant price advantage relative to alternate energy options, even with increasing carbon charges. Specific interest in natural gas connections is expected to come from communities that are not currently serviced by natural gas in Ontario. 
Enbridge Gas continues to focus on promoting conservation and energy efficiency by undertaking activities focused on reducing natural gas consumption through various demand side management programs offered across all markets and sourcing supply with a smaller carbon footprint. In addition to our existing RNG programs, we are also expanding our efforts in other low-carbon supply sourcing such as Responsibly Sourced Natural Gas, and Hydrogen Gas.
The storage and transportation marketplace continues to respond to changing natural gas supply dynamics, including a recovering supply environment which was negatively impacted by the global pandemic. 
Over the past decade, growth in the North American gas supply landscape, driven mainly by the development of unconventional gas resources in the Montney, Permian, Marcellus and Utica supply basins, has resulted in lower annual commodity prices and narrower seasonal price spreads. Unregulated storage values are primarily determined by the difference in value between winter and summer natural gas prices. Storage values have been relatively stable as North American natural gas supply and demand slowly returned to a more balanced position.
RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION
Renewable Power Generation consists primarily of investments in wind and solar assets, as well as geothermal, waste heat recovery, and transmission assets. In North America, assets are primarily located in the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Québec and in the states of Colorado, Texas, Indiana and West Virginia. We are also developing several solar self-power projects along our oil and gas rights-of-way in North America. In Europe, we hold equity interests in operating offshore wind facilities in the coastal waters of the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as interests in several offshore wind projects under construction and active development in France. Further, we are pursuing new European offshore wind development opportunities through Maple Power Ltd., a joint venture in which we hold a 50% interest.
Combined Renewable Power Generation investments represent approximately 2,178 MW of net generation capacity. Of this amount, approximately:
•1,392 MW is generated by North American wind facilities;
•255 MW is generated by European offshore wind facilities;
•309 MW will be generated by the Saint-Nazaire, Fécamp and Calvados Offshore Wind projects, all of which are currently under construction;
•6 MW will be generated by the Provence Grand Large Floating Offshore Wind project, which secured funding in 2021 and continues to prepare onshore construction; and
•93 MW is generated by North American solar facilities in operation, with an additional 97 MW in projects in early construction and under-construction.
The vast majority of the power produced from these facilities is sold under long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).
Renewable Power Generation also includes our 25% interest in the East-West Tie, a 450-MW transmission line in northwestern Ontario, which is currently under construction and is expected to reach commercial operation in the first half of 2022.
JOINT VENTURES / EQUITY INVESTMENTS
The investments in the Canadian wind and solar assets (excluding self-power) and two of the US renewable assets are held within a joint venture in which we maintain a 51% interest and which we manage and operate. 
We also own interests in European offshore wind facilities through the following joint ventures:
•a 24.9% interest in Rampion Offshore Wind, located in the United Kingdom;
•a 25.4% interest in Hohe See Offshore and its subsequent expansion, located in Germany; 
•a 25.5% interest in the Saint-Nazaire Offshore Wind project, under construction in France;
•a 25% interest in the Provence Grande Large Floating Offshore Wind project, in pre-construction in France;
•a 17.9% interest in the Fécamp Offshore Wind project, under construction in France; and
•a 21.7% interest in the Calvados Offshore Wind project, in pre-construction in France.
The ownership interest percentages in the Saint-Nazaire, Fécamp, and Calvados Offshore Wind projects reflect the sale of 49% of an entity that holds our 50% interest in Éolien Maritime France SAS (EMF) to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) which closed in the first half of 2021.
COMPETITION
Renewable Power Generation operates in the North American and European power markets, which are subject to competition and supply and demand fundamentals for power in the jurisdictions in which they operate. The majority of revenue is generated pursuant to long-term PPAs (or has been substantially hedged). As such, the financial performance is not significantly impacted by fluctuating power prices arising from supply/demand imbalances or the actions of competing facilities during the term of the applicable contracts. However, the renewable energy sector includes large utilities, small independent power producers and private equity investors, which are expected to aggressively compete for new project development opportunities and for the right to supply customers when contracts expire.
To grow in an environment of heightened competition, we strategically seek opportunities to collaborate with well-established renewable power developers and financial partners and to target regions with commercial constructs consistent with our low risk business model. In addition, we bring to bear the expertise of completing and delivering large scale infrastructure projects.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND
The renewable power generation network in North America and Europe is expected to grow significantly over the next 20 years due to the replacement of older fossil fuel-based sources of electricity generation in support of announced governmental carbon emissions reduction targets. Any additional governmental actions toward reducing emissions and/or increasing electrification will further accelerate renewable electricity demand growth and electrification across all sectors.
On the demand side, North American economic growth over the longer term and the continued electrification and transition to low-carbon strategies within the residential, transportation and industrial sectors are expected to drive growing electricity demand. Furthermore, voluntary GHG emissions targets are becoming increasingly expected by stakeholders, which is driving significant demand from corporate electricity end-users for clean electricity and environmental attributes. However, continued efficiency gains are expected to make the economy less energy-intensive and temper overall demand growth. 
On the supply side in North America, legislation is accelerating the retirement of aging coal-fired generation, while generation from conventional nuclear power is also forecast to decline. As a result, North America requires significant new generation capacity from preferred technologies. Gas-fired and renewable energy facilities, including solar and wind (which make up the bulk of our renewable power assets), are generally the preferred sources to replace coal-fired generation due to their low carbon intensities.
The falling capital and operating costs of wind and solar, combined with their improving capacity factors, are expected to continue the ongoing trend of making renewable energy more competitive and support investment over the long-term, regardless of available government incentives. Generation from renewable sources is expected to double over the next two decades in North America. Aside from the construction of new wind and solar facilities, other growth opportunities include repowering projects to increase output from, and extending the project-life of, our existing facilities.
In Europe, the renewable energy outlook is robust. Demand for electricity is expected to gradually increase over the next two decades, driven by electrification of transportation and buildings. Energy efficiency gains will temper, but not eliminate, demand growth. Renewable power will play a significant role in the United Kingdom’s ability to meet their aggressive low-carbon and renewable energy targets, particularly offshore wind.
On the supply side, the International Energy Agency expects coal to fall by more than 90% from 2020 levels, while nuclear falls by one-third, by 2040. Over the same period, it anticipates power generation from renewable sources will more than double, including installed (onshore and offshore) wind more than doubling and photovoltaics solar power nearly tripling. We, through our European joint ventures, continue to invest in offshore wind projects in the United Kingdom, France and Germany, and to explore opportunities, to meet the growing demand.
ENERGY SERVICES
The Energy Services businesses in Canada and the US provide physical commodity marketing and logistical services to North American refiners, producers, and other customers.
Energy Services is primarily focused on servicing customers across the value chain and capturing value from quality, time, and location price differentials when opportunities arise. To execute these strategies, Energy Services transports and stores on both Enbridge-owned and third party assets using a combination of contracted long-term and short-term pipeline, storage, railcar, and truck capacity agreements.
COMPETITION
Energy Services’ earnings are primarily generated from arbitrage opportunities which, by their nature, can be replicated by competitors. An increase in market participants entering into similar arbitrage strategies could have an impact on our earnings. Efforts to mitigate competition risk include diversification of the marketing business by transacting at the majority of major hubs in North America and establishing long-term relationships with clients and pipelines.
ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER
Eliminations and Other includes operating and administrative costs that are not allocated to business segments and the impact of foreign exchange hedge settlements. Eliminations and Other also includes new business development activities and corporate investments.
REGULATION
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Pipeline Regulation
Our Liquids Pipelines and Gas Transmission and Midstream assets are subject to numerous operational rules and regulations mandated by governments or applicable regulatory authorities, breaches of which could result in fines, penalties, operating restrictions and an overall increase in operating and compliance costs.
In the US, our interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations administered by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), an agency within the United States Department of Transportation. These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines. These laws and regulations, among other things, include requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines and to operate them at permissible pressures.
PHMSA continues to review existing regulations and establish new regulations to support safety standards that are designed to improve and expand operations integrity management processes. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failure or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, capital expenditures, earnings, cash flows, financial condition and competitive advantage.
Our ability to establish transportation and storage rates on our US interstate natural gas facilities are subject to regulation by the FERC, whose rulings and policies could have an adverse impact on the ability of such pipeline and storage assets to recover their respective full cost of operating, including a reasonable rate of return. Regulatory or administrative actions by FERC such as rate proceedings, applications to certify construction of new facilities, and depreciation and amortization policies can affect our business, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues and increasing our costs of doing business. 
In Canada, our pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety regulations administered by the CER or provincial regulators. Applicable legislation and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our pipelines. Among other obligations, this regulatory framework imposes requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines.
As in the US, several legislative changes addressing pipeline safety in Canada have recently been enacted. The changes evidence an increased focus on the implementation of management systems to address key areas such as emergency management, integrity management, safety, security and environmental protection. Other legislative changes have created authority for the CER to impose administrative monetary penalties for non-compliance with the regulatory regime it administers, as well as to impose financial requirements for future abandonment and major pipeline releases.
A key component of pipeline safety and reliability is the approach to integrity management that uses reliability targets and safety case assessments. A long history of extensive inline inspection has provided detailed knowledge of the assets in our pipeline systems. Our pipelines are assessed and maintained, in a proactive manner, such that the probability of a release is sufficiently low and that our reliability targets are met. Furthermore, the integrity management program has an independent step to check the results of our integrity assessments to validate the effectiveness of the program and to ensure that the operational risk remains as low as reasonably practicable throughout the integrity inspection and assessment cycle. As inspection technology, pipeline materials and construction practices improve with time, and new data on threats and pipeline condition are gathered, our methods of maintaining fitness for service evolves, with a strong focus on continual improvement in every aspect of integrity management.
Our pipelines also face economic regulation risk. Broadly defined, economic regulation risk is the risk that governments or regulatory agencies change or reject proposed or existing commercial arrangements or policies, including permits and regulatory approvals for both new and existing projects or agreements, upon which future and current operations are dependent. Our Mainline System and other liquids pipelines and gas transmission facilities are subject to the actions of various regulators, including the CER and the FERC, with respect to the tariffs and tolls of those pipelines. The changing or rejecting of commercial arrangements, including decisions by regulators on the applicable permits and tariff structure or changes in interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulators, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. 
Gas Distribution and Storage
Our gas distribution and storage utility operations are regulated by the OEB and the Québec Régie de l’énergie, among others. To the extent that the regulators’ future actions are different from current expectations, the timing and amount of recovery or refund of amounts recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, or amounts that would have been recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in the absence of the effects of regulation, could be different from the amounts that are eventually recovered or refunded.
Enbridge Gas' distribution rates, commencing in 2019, are set under a five-year incentive regulation (IR) framework using a price cap mechanism. The price cap mechanism establishes new rates each year through an annual base rate escalation at inflation less a 0.3% productivity factor, annual updates for certain costs to be passed through to customers, and where applicable, the recovery of material discrete incremental capital investments beyond those that can be funded through base rates. The IR framework includes the continuation and establishment of certain deferral and variance accounts, as well as an earnings sharing mechanism that requires Enbridge Gas to share equally with customers any earnings in excess of 150 basis points over the annual OEB approved return on equity (ROE).
We retain dedicated professional staff and maintain strong relationships with customers, intervenors and regulators. This strong regulatory relationship continued in 2021 following OEB Decisions and Orders approving Phase 2 of Enbridge Gas’ application for 2021 rates and Phase 1 of Enbridge Gas’ application for 2022 rates. The Phase 2 Decision and Order approved the funding of $124 million in 2021 discrete incremental capital investment requested through the incremental capital module, while the Phase 1 Decision and Order approved 2022 base rate escalation under the price cap mechanism.
Enbridge Gas continues to develop opportunities to support a low-carbon future in Ontario. In 2021, we received OEB approval of an Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) framework. The framework requires Enbridge Gas to consider facility and non-pipe demand and/or supply side alternatives (IRP alternatives) to address systems needs of its regulated operations, where certain parameters have been met. The framework will also allow Enbridge Gas to pursue an IRP alternative (or combination of IRP and facility alternative) where it is found to be in the best interest of Enbridge Gas and its customers, taking into account reliability and safety, cost-effectiveness, public policy, optimized scoping, and risk management. 
Renewable Power Generation
Renewable Power Generation is subject to numerous operational rules and regulations mandated by governments or applicable regulatory authorities, breaches of which could result in fines, penalties, operating restrictions and an overall increase in operating and compliance costs.
The North American Reliability Council (NERC) is an international regulatory authority responsible for establishing and enforcing Reliability Standards to reduce risks to the reliability and security of the grid in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. It is subject to oversight from the FERC and provincial governments in Canada. The FERC has authority over many markets in the US and is tasked with ensuring safe, reliable, and secure interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas, and oil. This includes establishing reliability standards and determining certain pricing aspects of transmission development and access, among others. NERC and FERC standards and pricing decisions are also updated from time to time and could impact our operations, capital expenditures, earnings, and cash flows, though some of these impacts could be positive for our business.
At the US federal level, our Renewable Power Generation assets are subject to legislation overseen by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which is aimed at reducing the impact of development and human activity on wildlife, along with other federal environmental permitting legislation. These federal environmental laws are subject to change from time to time which could require Enbridge to obtain new permits, update practices, or amend operations and operating expenditures.
In Canada, the Federal Government does not generally regulate the electricity sector though it has imposed a federal carbon price on other sectors via its output-based pricing system (OBPS) and may seek to impose emissions standards on the electricity sector in the future.
Our Renewable Power Generation assets in France and Germany each have federal policies in place and are subject to directives and regulations established and enforced by the European Union (EU). These include the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II most recently passed set targets through 2030), the European Green Deal, and ongoing work on financing mechanisms and transmission directives and programs. The EU is also responsible for establishing environmental protection rules and permitting standards. All of these are subject to change from time to time, which could impact our operations and related expenditures; however the EU’s general direction is to facilitate increased renewable power integration to its grid.
The United Kingdom (UK) government is responsible for establishing renewable energy and carbon pricing policies for the entire UK, as well as long-term electricity sector planning and procurement mechanisms and structure for auctions that are administered at the national level, e.g., England, Scotland, within the UK. Each country within the UK is also responsible for establishing its own environmental and permitting regulations. This process is still ongoing following Brexit and in some cases continues to result in more volatile merchant power prices; however, expanded interconnectors to Europe and policies aimed at increasing domestic renewable capacity are in progress.
Energy Services
Energy Services is regulated by government authorities in the areas of commodity trading, import and export compliance and the transportation of commodities. Non-compliance with governing rules and regulations could result in fines, penalties and operating restrictions. These consequences would have an adverse effect on operations, earnings, cash flows, financial condition and competitive advantage. Energy Services retains dedicated professional staff and has a robust regulatory compliance program to mitigate these potential risks associated with the business.
In the US, commodity marketing is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the SEC, the Federal Trade Commission, the various commodity exchanges, the US Department of Justice and state regulators. The interstate marketing of electricity and natural gas is also regulated by the FERC. The provincial and territorial securities regulators similarly regulate commodity marketing within Canada and are members of the Canadian Securities Administrators. In addition, the Regional Transmission Organizations and Independent System Operators in both US and Canada regulate commodity marketing. These various regulators enforce, among other things, the prohibition of market manipulation, fraud and disruptive trading. To mitigate risks related to commodity trading, Energy Services has implemented a robust regulatory compliance program that includes targeted training.
The export of natural gas out of Alberta is regulated by the Alberta Energy Regulator. The import and export of commodities between Canada and the US is subject to regulation by the CER and the US Department of Energy, as well as customs authorities. In particular, import and export permits are required, with associated regular reporting requirements. Breaches of such import and export rules could result in an inability to perform day to day operations, and therein negatively impact the earnings of the business.
The transportation of crude oil and natural gas liquids by railcar or truck is regulated by the US Department of Transportation, Transport Canada and provincial regulation. Each jurisdiction requires compliance with security, safety, emergency management, and environmental laws and regulations related to ground transportation of commodities. Risks associated with transportation of crude or natural gas liquids include unplanned releases. In the event of a release, remediation of the affected area would be required. Energy Services engages third parties, such as the Emergency Response Assistance Canada, Chemical Transportation Emergency Center and Canadian Transport Emergency Center to assist in such remediation.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION
Pipeline Regulation
Our Liquids Pipelines and Gas Transmission and Midstream assets are subject to numerous federal, state and provincial environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, water discharge and waste. These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits and other approvals.
In particular, in the US, compliance with major Clean Air Act regulatory programs is likely to cause us to incur significant capital expenditures to obtain permits, evaluate off-site impacts of our operations, install pollution control equipment, and otherwise assure compliance. Some states in which we operate are implementing new emissions limits to comply with 2008 ozone standards regulated under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. In 2015, the ozone standards were lowered even further from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb, which may require states to implement additional emissions regulations. The precise nature of these compliance obligations at each of our facilities has not been finally determined and may depend in part on future regulatory changes. In addition, compliance with new and emerging environmental regulatory programs may significantly increase our operating costs compared to historical levels.
In the US, climate change action is evolving at federal, state and regional levels. The Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency in 2007 established that GHG emissions were pollutants subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act. Pursuant to federal regulations, we are currently subject to an obligation to report our GHG emissions at our largest emitting facilities but are not generally subject to limits on emissions of GHGs. The new US presidential administration has also announced that policies designed to combat climate change and reduce GHG emissions will be a key legislative and regulatory priority, and thus stricter emissions limits and air quality enforcement actions are likely. In addition, a number of states have joined regional GHG initiatives, and a number are developing their own programs that would mandate reductions in GHG emissions. Public interest groups and regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing on the emission of methane associated with natural gas development and transmission as a source of GHG emissions. However, as the key details of future GHG restrictions and compliance mechanisms remain undefined, the likely future effects on our business are highly uncertain.
For its part, Canada has reaffirmed its strong preference for a harmonized approach on climate action with that of the US. In 2019, the Government of Canada implemented a federal system of carbon pricing. The pricing applies to provinces and territories that do not have a carbon pricing system in place that meets the federal benchmark. The Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which received royal assent in April 2021, requires national targets for the reduction of GHG emissions in Canada be set, with the objective of attaining net-zero emissions by 2050. As of April 2021, the federal carbon price was raised to $40 per tonne. This will increase to $65 per tonne in 2023 and rise to $170 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030.
Due to the speculative outlook regarding any US federal and state policies, we cannot estimate the potential effect of proposed GHG policies on our future consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, such legislation or regulation could materially increase our operating costs, require material capital expenditures or create additional permitting, which could delay proposed construction projects.
Gas Distribution and Storage
Our Gas Distribution and Storage operations, facilities and workers are subject to municipal, provincial and federal legislation which regulate the protection of the environment and the health and safety of workers. Environmental legislation primarily includes regulation of spills and emissions to air, land and water; hazardous waste management; the assessment and management of contaminated sites; protection of environmentally sensitive areas, and species at risk and their habitat; and the reporting and reduction of GHG emissions.
Gas distribution system operation, as with any industrial operation, has the potential risk of abnormal or emergency conditions, or other unplanned events that could result in releases or emissions exceeding permitted levels. These events could result in injuries to workers or the public, adverse impacts to the environment, property damage and/or regulatory infractions including orders and fines. We could also incur future liability for soil and groundwater contamination associated with past and present site activities.
In addition to gas distribution, we also operate storage facilities and a small volume of oil and brine production in southwestern Ontario. Environmental risk associated with these facilities has the potential for unplanned releases. In the event of a release, remediation of the affected area would be required. There would also be potential for fines, orders or charges under environmental legislation, and potential third-party liability claims by any affected landowners.
The gas distribution system and our other operations must maintain environmental approvals and permits from regulators to operate. As a result, these assets and facilities are subject to periodic inspections and/or audits. Annual reports, such as Annual Written Summary Reports for Environmental Compliance Approvals (ECAs) are submitted to the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) and other regulators to demonstrate we are in good standing with our environmental requirements. Failure to maintain regulatory compliance could result in operational interruptions, fines, and/or orders for additional pollution control technology or environmental mitigation. As environmental requirements and regulations become more stringent, the cost to maintain compliance and the time required to obtain approvals is expected to increase.
As in previous years, in 2021, we reported operational GHG emissions, including emissions from stationary combustion, flaring, venting and fugitive sources to Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), the Ontario MECP, and a number of voluntary reporting programs. In accordance with the provincial GHG regulations, stationary combustion and flaring emissions related to storage and transmission operations were verified in detail by a third-party accredited verifier with no material discrepancies found.
Enbridge Gas utilizes emissions data management processes and systems to help with the data capture and mandatory and voluntary reporting needs. Quantification methodologies and emission factors will continually be updated in our systems as required. Enbridge Gas continues to work with industry associations to refine quantification methodologies and emissions factors, as well as best management practices to minimize emissions.
In October 2018, the federal government confirmed that Ontario is subject to the federal government’s carbon pricing program, otherwise known as the Federal Carbon Pricing Backstop Program. This program consists of two components: a carbon charge levied on fossil fuels, including natural gas, and an OBPS.
The federal carbon charge took effect on April 1, 2019 at a rate of 3.91 cents/cubic meter (m3) of natural gas and is applicable to the majority of customers. Enbridge Gas is registered as a natural gas distributor with the Canada Revenue Agency and remits the federal carbon charge on a monthly basis. The charge increases annually on April 1 of each year by 1.96 cents/m3, rising up to 9.79 cents/m3 in 2022. In December 2020, the federal government announced plans to increase the federal carbon price by $15 per tonne each year in 2023, rising to $170 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030. Enbridge Gas estimates that this will equate to a federal carbon charge on natural gas of approximately 33.31 cents/m3 in 2030. Enbridge Gas applies for approval from the OEB on an annual basis to pass through federal carbon charges.
The OBPS component came into effect on January 1, 2019. Under OBPS, a registered facility has a compliance obligation for the portion of their emissions that exceeds their annual facility emissions limit, which is calculated based on the sector specific output-based standard and annual production. Enbridge Gas is registered with ECCC as an emitter in the OBPS program and has an annual compliance obligation associated with the combustion and flaring emissions associated with its natural gas pipeline transmission system. As a registered facility under OBPS, Enbridge Gas submitted an annual report along with the required verification report from an accredited third-party verifier who found no material misstatements. Enbridge Gas is required to remit payment for facility emissions that exceed its annual facility emissions limit. Due to COVID-19, ECCC delayed the payment deadline for the 2019 compliance obligation from December 15, 2020 to April 15, 2021. Enbridge Gas made payment for the 2019 compliance obligation in March 2021 and for the 2020 compliance obligation in November 2021.
In September 2020, Ontario and the federal government announced that the federal government has accepted that Ontario’s Emission Performance Standards (EPS) will replace the federal OBPS for industrial facilities. In March 2021, the federal government announced that the federal OBPS will stand down in Ontario at the end of 2021 and Ontario will transition to the EPS effective January 1, 2022. In September 2021, the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act was amended to remove Ontario as a covered province effective January 1, 2022. Beginning January 1, 2022, Enbridge Gas will have a compliance obligation under the EPS program for its facility-related emissions, as well as the federal carbon charge for its customer-related emissions.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
WORKFORCE SIZE AND COMPOSITION
As at December 31, 2021, we had approximately 10,900 regular employees, including approximately 1,500 unionized employees across our North American operations. This total rises to nearly 13,000 if temporary employees and contractors are included. We have a strong preference for direct employment relationships but where we have collectively bargained-for employees, we have mature working relationships with our labor unions and the parties have traditionally committed themselves to the achievement of renewal agreements without a work stoppage.
SAFETY
We believe all injuries, incidents and occupational illnesses are preventable. Our overall focus on employee and contractor safety, including through the COVID-19 pandemic, continues to result in strong performance compared against industry benchmarks and we are actively engaged in continuous improvement exercises as we pursue our goal of zero incidents. 
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
To ensure our workforce is reflective of the communities where we operate, we have pursued efforts to increase the representation of women, underrepresented ethnic and racial groups, people with disabilities and veterans. In 2021 we set diversity representation goals and shared these goals with employees and external stakeholders. Consistent with our culture, we remain committed to open, two-way dialogue related to our goals, enhancing transparency and accountability for all stakeholders. 
In 2021, we added Inclusion to our core values of Safety, Integrity and Respect to demonstrate this commitment. We are building an organization where people feel safe and welcome and have the opportunity to thrive and grow based on merit. As part of our evolving ESG strategy, we created a tighter link between our success and the workforce related ESG measures – including safety, emissions reduction efforts and diversity & inclusion – that enable it. As a result, beginning in 2021, key metrics in these areas are embedded in our scorecards and directly impact compensation.
PRODUCTIVITY AND DEVELOPMENT
We continually invest in our people’s personal and professional development because we recognize their success is our success. Every year, employees are provided access to a range of development and re-skilling opportunities through a variety of channels, including: extensive catalog of self-directed learning (10,000+ external courses plus proprietary Enbridge University courses); on-the-job learning opportunities and rotational assignments; curated leadership development programs; educational reimbursement; and developmental relationships with mentors through our formal mentor-protégé matching program.
