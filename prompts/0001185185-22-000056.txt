Overview



NovAccess Global Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that is developing novel immunotherapies to treat brain tumor patients in the United States with plans to expand globally. We specialize in cutting-edge research related to utilizing a patient’s own immune system to attack the cancer. We are filing an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) and working closely with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to obtain approval for human clinical trials to determine safety and efficacy of our drug product for brain cancer patients. Once we have successfully completed the clinical trials and proven that the new therapy is safe and efficacious, we plan to commercialize the product. We also have expertise in successfully executing clinical trials, bringing products to market and increasing the market size of products through our advisory board. Our scientists are well versed in immunology, stem cell biology, neuroscience, molecular biology, imaging, small molecules development, gene therapy and other technical assays needed for protein and genetic analysis of cancer cells.



NovAccess operates as a research and development (R&D) company out of Ohio and California, and our executive management and scientific advisory board provide over 15 years of extensive experience in all aspects of biopharmaceutical R&D and commercialization of drug candidates. We guide our performance by striving to deliver consistently on the following core objectives: (1) Accountability — taking responsibility for providing safe and effective options for patients; (2) Integrity — doing what is ethically right for the patient; (3) Excellence — doing your best and working hard; and (4) Teamwork — bringing together a strong working team to deliver the best products for brain tumor patients.



In 2018, Innovest Global, Inc. acquired 20% of StemVax, LLC, a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for brain tumor patients that holds an exclusive patent license from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California (Cedars-Sinai) known as StemVax Glioblast (SVX-GB). The Innovest investment provided StemVax with the resources to extend the license for SVX-GB. Dr. Christopher Wheeler, president of StemVax, has been involved in the pre-clinical research and development of the drug candidate at Cedars-Sinai Department of Neurosurgery since 2005. As president, Dr. Wheeler began preparing the pre-IND application to obtain FDA approval to start human clinical trials. In February 2020, Innovest acquired 100% of StemVax and on September 8, 2020, NovAccess acquired StemVax from Innovest for 7.5 million shares of NovAccess. In October 2020, Dr. Dwain Morris-Irvin joined NovAccess as our chief executive officer. In February 2021, we contracted with Dr. Wheeler to continue serving as president of StemVax.

Recent Events



As previously disclosed, on October 26, 2021, TN3, LLC (“TN3”), a company owned by Daniel G. Martin, our sole board member and chairman, entered into a preferred stock purchase agreement (the “purchase agreement”) with GPC Holdings, Inc. (“GPC”), a company owed indirectly by Shaheed Bailey. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, TN3 agreed to sell TN3’s shares of NovAccess Global Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to GPC. Upon completion of TN3’s sale of the preferred stock to GPC, Mr. Martin would resign from the NovAccess board and be replaced by Mr. Bailey. The parties expected that the transaction would close during the week of December 13, 2021. However, the conditions to closing were not satisfied and on December 30, 2021, TN3 terminated the purchase agreement pursuant to its terms.
Organization and History



NovAccess Global Inc. is a Colorado corporation incorporated on February 25, 1997 as “Sun River Mining, Inc.” In 2003, the Company was renamed “XsunX, Inc.” and entered the solar business, specializing in the sale, design, and installation of solar photovoltaic power generation and energy storage systems. Effective August 25, 2020, we filed articles of amendment to our articles of incorporation with the Colorado Secretary of State to: effectuate a 1-for-1,000 reverse stock split of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock; and change the name of the Company to “NovAccess Global Inc.” After completing the acquisition of StemVax, we exited the solar business and focused all our efforts on our biopharmaceutical business.

Business and Operations



Market Drivers for Immunotherapy against Cancer



The most common adult brain tumor has less than a 15-month median survival period after diagnosis. Despite advances in chemotherapy and radiation therapy there has been no change in survival for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients in over 50 years. As a result, there is significant demand for novel therapies to treat brain tumors. We identify two main drivers to bring immunotherapy to market as quickly as possible: (1) the National Institutes of Health has been promoting the development of novel immunotherapies for cancer for over 10 years; and (2) the biopharmaceutical industry has been promoting the development of novel immunotherapies to treat cancer and bringing novel products to market, including Dendreon’s Provenge drug to treat prostate cancer.
What We Do



NovAccess is biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the research and development of a new drug to treat brain cancer and other cancers. We perform pre-clinical and clinical trial experiments to bring the drugs to market. We determine if the new drug candidates are safe and effective for human use and to treat brain and other cancers. We seek to develop a new treatment or a cure for brain cancer patients and make these solutions for these patients a sound investment for our shareholders.



We are developing novel therapies for brain cancer patients in the US and ultimately globally. Our R&D process begins with testing drug candidates through molecular and cellular based assays, animal models for diseases, testing for safety and efficacy in animal models, and human clinical trials to bring drug candidates to market. Once our products have made it to market, we plan to license their use to bigger pharmaceutical companies to better access the patient populations and provide treatment.



We currently do not generate revenue. In order to finance our operations, including clinical trials development and execution, we intend to raise capital through financial institutions that invest in cancer therapeutics. As we achieve milestones during the process of R&D, we expect our overall value to increase. We intend to commercialize our products immediately after successful completion of clinical trials. We plan to license our products to larger biopharmaceutical companies to deliver our product to as many patients as possible once we have obtained the required FDA approvals. We expect to have other treatment candidates outside of our lead candidate moving forward as we build our patent portfolio of other therapeutics to improve patient outcomes and overall quality of health.



The key elements of our approach include:




● | Lead Drug Candidate. We perform pre-clinical R&D to test hypothesis to determine if a lead product is safe and efficacious to treat cancer patients. These experiments include, molecular testing, cell culture testing and animal testing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Publish Data. When appropriate we publish our findings and pursue patents protection for all drug candidates to proceed with human clinical trial testing
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Human Clinical Trial Testing. At the appropriate time we will seek FDA approval to begin clinical trials on our drug candidates. We submit IND applications to the FDA to obtain this approval.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Commercialization. After successfully completing human clinical trials and demonstrating safety and efficacy of a drug candidate, we will commercialize the product.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers



At this stage, we do not generate revenue but once we commercialize our products our customers are expected to be cancer patients and/or larger biopharmaceutical companies that we license our products through in order to complete human clinical trial testing and/or to commercialize our products. Because there is currently no immunotherapy to treat brain tumors on the market and survival rates for GBM patients have not improved through standard operational procedures, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy, we anticipate a significant market for our products.
Competition



We compete with other R&D biopharmaceutical companies developing novel immunotherapies to treat brain cancer. Currently, there are no FDA approved immunotherapies available to GBM patients in the market. We have a platform technology as our lead candidate. Once we have commercialized this lead product after proving it is safe and efficacious from our human clinical trial testing, we will seek approval to utilize our platform technology to treat other brain cancers, including childhood brain cancer and other cancers in general.

Intellectual Property



In September and June of 2017, Cedars-Sinai was issued patents, “Use of toll-like receptor ligands as adjuvants to vaccination therapy for brain tumors,” Patent numbers: 9764014 and 8728465. In 2018, StemVax obtained an exclusive license for these patents from Cedars-Sinai. The license term is for the full life of the patents on a country-by-country basis.
Regulation



Our business is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA governing the development, testing, marketing and sale of our biopharmaceuticals. However, compliance with environmental laws is not a significant cost for the Company.
Employees and Consultants



Dr. Dwain Morris-Irvin is our chief executive officer and Neil J. Laird is our fractional chief financial officer. We also rely on qualified consultants to perform specific functions that otherwise would require an employee. As we expand our business developments efforts, we plan to add staff and executive officers to respond to and assist with operations. We consider relations with our full and part-time employees and consultants to be good. To conserve cash we have relied on equity grants to attract and retain key personnel.
Seasonality



Research and development in medicine has no seasonality to its operations.
