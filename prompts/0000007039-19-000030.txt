Business Segments
We operate in two business segments; the manufacturing of various specialty petrochemical products and the manufacturing of specialty synthetic waxes.
Our specialty petrochemical products segment is conducted through SHR, a Texas corporation. SHR owns and operates a specialty petrochemical facility near Silsbee, Texas which produces high purity hydrocarbons and other petroleum based products including isopentane, normal pentane, isohexane and hexane. These products are used in the production of polyethylene, packaging, polypropylene, expandable polystyrene, poly-iso/urethane foams, crude oil from the Canadian tar sands, and in the catalyst support industry.   Our specialty petrochemical products are typically transported to customers by rail car, tank truck, iso-container, and by ship. SHR owns all of the capital stock of GSPL, a Texas corporation, which owns and operates pipelines that connect the SHR facility to a natural gas line, to SHR's truck and rail loading terminal and to a major petroleum products pipeline owned by an unaffiliated third party. SHR also provides custom processing services.
Our specialty synthetic wax segment is conducted through TC, a Texas corporation, located in Pasadena, Texas which produces specialty polyethylene and poly alpha olefin waxes and provides custom processing services. The specialty polyethylene waxes are used in markets from paints and inks to adhesives, coatings, and PVC lubricants. The highly specialized synthetic poly alpha olefin waxes are used in applications such as toner in printers and as additives for candles. These waxes are sold in solid form as pastilles or, for large adhesive companies, in bulk liquid form.
See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
United States Specialty Petrochemical Operations
SHR's specialty petrochemical facility is located in Silsbee, Texas approximately 30 miles north of Beaumont and 90 miles east of Houston. The facility consists of eight operating units which, while interconnected, make distinct products through differing processes: (i) a Penhex Unit; (ii) a Reformer Unit; (iii) a Cyclo-pentane Unit; (iv) an Advanced Reformer unit; (v) an Aromatics Hydrogenation Unit; (vi) a White Oil Fractionation Unit; (vii) a Hydrocarbon Processing Demonstration Unit; and (viii) a P-Xylene Unit. All of these units are currently in operation. The Penhex Unit currently has the permitted capacity to process approximately 11,000 barrels per day of fresh feed. The Reformer Unit, the Advanced Reformer unit, and the Cyclo-Pentane Unit further process streams produced by the Penhex Unit. The Aromatics Hydrogenation Unit was taken out of service and decommissioned in 2018 with the start up of the new Advanced Reformer unit. The White Oils Fractionation Unit has a capacity of approximately 3,000 barrels per day. The Hydrocarbon Processing Demonstration Unit has a capacity of approximately 300 gallons per day. The P-Xylene Unit has a capacity of approximately 20,000 pounds per year. The facility generally consists of equipment commonly found in most petrochemical facilities such as fractionation towers and hydrogen treaters except the facility is adapted to produce specialized products that are high purity and very consistent with precise specifications that are utilized in the petrochemical industry as solvents, additives, blowing agents and cooling agents. We produce eight distinct product streams and market several combinations of blends as needed in various customer applications. We do not produce motor fuel products or any other products commonly sold directly to retail consumers or outlets.

We believe we are positioned to benefit from capital investments that we have recently completed. We now have sufficient pentane capacity to maintain our share of market growth for the foreseeable future. We believe that the Advanced Reformer unit will contribute to increased revenue and gross margin over time and as we improve reliability. While petrochemical prices are volatile on a short-term basis, and volumes depend on the demand of our customers' products and overall customer efficiency, our investment decisions are based on our long-term business strategy and outlook.
During 2015, we constructed a new unit which is part of the Penhex Unit, D Train, which began production in the fourth quarter of 2015. The D Train expansion increased our capacity by approximately 6,000 barrels per day of fresh feed. Our present total capacity is 13,000 barrels per day of fresh feed; however, we are currently only permitted to process 11,000 barrels per day. During 2018, we constructed a 4,000 barrels per day Advanced Reformer unit to increase our capability to upgrade byproducts produced from the PenHex Unit and to provide security of hydrogen supply to the plant. 
Products from the Penhex Unit, Reformer Unit, Advanced Reformer unit, and Cyclo-pentane Unit are marketed directly to the customer by our marketing personnel. The Penhex Unit had a utilization rate during 2018 of approximately 56% based upon 11,000 barrels per day of capacity. The Penhex Unit had a utilization rate during 2017 of approximately 53% based upon 11,000 barrels per day of capacity. The Penhex Unit had a utilization rate during 2016 of approximately 48% based upon 11,000 barrels per day. 
Penhex Unit capacity is now configured in three independent process units. The three unit configuration improves reliability by reducing the amount of total down time due to mechanical and other factors. This configuration also allows us to use spare capacity for new product development. The Advanced Reformer and Reformer units are operated as needed to support the Penhex and Cyclo-pentane Units. Consequently, utilization rates of these units are driven by production from the Penhex Unit. Operating utilization rates are affected by product demand, raw material composition, mechanical integrity, and unforeseen natural occurrences, such as weather events. The nature of the petrochemical process demands periodic shut-downs for de-coking and other mechanical repairs. 
In February 2018, while attempting to commission the new Advanced Reformer unit, the unit overheated and ignited a fire. There was damage to all six heaters in the unit, and the damaged equipment had to be replaced. The total repair cost was approximately $3.5 million. Our insurers covered costs over our $1 million deductible. On July 9, 2018, we announced the safe and successful start up of the Advanced Reformer unit. In mid-September 2018 the Silsbee facility suffered a power outage causing a shutdown of the plant, including the Advanced Reformer unit. In October 2018, after extensive engineering review and consultations with the technology licensor of the Unit it was determined that the unit's catalyst required replacement. We completed the catalyst replacement and successfully restarted the Unit in December 2018. The cost of the catalyst replacement was approximately $3 million. During the time the Advanced Reformer unit was not operation due to the catalyst replacement work, we incurred losses as a result of sales of byproducts at prices well below the cost of feedstock.
In support of the specialty petrochemical operation, we own approximately 100 storage tanks with total capacity approaching 285,000 barrels, and 127 acres of land at the plant site, 92 acres of which are developed. We also own a truck and railroad loading terminal consisting of storage tanks, nine rail spurs, and truck and tank car loading facilities on approximately 63 acres of which 33 acres are developed. As a result of various expansion programs and the toll processing contracts, essentially all of the standing equipment at SHR is operational. We have various surplus equipment stored on-site which may be used in the future to assemble additional processing units as needs arise.
We obtain our feedstock requirements from a sole supplier. The agreement is primarily a logistics arrangement. The supplier buys or contracts for material and utilizes their tank and pipeline connections to transport into our pipeline. The supplier's revenue above feed cost is primarily related to the cost and operation of the tank, pipelines, and equipment. A contract was signed in August 2015 with a seven year term with subsequent one year renewals unless canceled by either party with 180 days' notice. In 2015, a pipeline connection to the supplier's dock was added to give alternative means of receiving feedstock. 
GSPL owns and operates three 8-inch diameter pipelines and five 4-inch diameter pipelines, aggregating approximately 70 miles in length connecting SHR's facility to (1) a natural gas line, (2) SHR's truck and rail loading terminal and (3) a major petroleum products pipeline system owned by an unaffiliated third party. All pipelines are operated within Texas Railroad Commission and DOT regulations for maintenance and integrity.
We sell our products predominantly to large domestic and international companies. Products are marketed via personal contact and through continued long term relationships. Sales personnel visit customer facilities regularly and also attend various petrochemical conferences throughout the world. We also have a website with information about our products and services. We utilize both formula and non-formula based pricing depending upon a customer's requirements. Under formula pricing the price charged to the customer is primarily based on a formula which includes as a component the average cost of feedstock over the prior month. With this pricing mechanism, product prices move in conjunction with feedstock prices. However, because the formulas use an average feedstock price from the prior month, the movement of prices will trail the movement of costs, and formula prices may or may not reflect our actual feedstock cost for the month during which the product is actually sold. In addition, while

formula pricing can reduce product margins during periods of increasing feedstock costs, during periods of decreasing feedstock costs formula pricing will follow feed costs down but will retain higher margins during the period by trailing the movement of costs by approximately 30 days. During 2018 and 2017, sales to one customer exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenues. During 2018 and 2017, sales to ExxonMobil and their affiliates were 17% and 20% of total revenues, respectively. These sales represented multiple products sold to multiple facilities.

United States Mineral Interests
Our only mineral interest in the United States is our 55% ownership interest in an inactive corporation, PEVM. PEVM's properties include 48 patented and 5 unpatented claims totaling approximately 1,500 acres. All of the claims are located in Lincoln County, NV.
At this time, neither we nor PEVM have plans to develop the mining assets near Pioche, NV. Periodically proposals are received from outside parties who are interested in developing or using certain assets. We do not anticipate making any significant domestic mining capital expenditures.
Environmental
Matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 2 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In 1993 during remediation of a small spill area, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ("TCEQ") required SHR to drill a well to check for groundwater contamination under the spill area. Two pools of hydrocarbons were discovered to be floating on the groundwater at a depth of approximately 25 feet. One pool is under the site of a former gas processing plant owned and operated by Sinclair, Arco and others before its purchase by SHR in 1981. Analysis of the material indicates it entered the ground prior to SHR's acquisition of the property. The other pool is under the original SHR facility and analysis indicates the material was deposited decades ago. Tests conducted have determined that the hydrocarbons are contained on the property and not migrating in any direction. The recovery process was initiated in June 1998 and approximately $53,000 was spent setting up the system. The recovery is proceeding as planned and is expected to continue for many years until the pools are reduced to acceptable levels. Expenses of recovery and periodic migration testing are being recorded as normal operating expenses. Expenses for future recovery are expected to stabilize and be less per annum than the initial set up cost, although there is no assurance of this effect. The light hydrocarbon recovered from the former gas plant site is compatible with our normal Penhex feedstock and is accumulated and transferred into the Penhex feedstock tank. The material recovered from under the original SHR site is accumulated and sold as a by-product. Approximately 144, 80, and 70 barrels were recovered during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The recovered material had a value of approximately $5,800, $4,200, and $3,200 during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Consulting engineers estimate that as much as 20,000 barrels of recoverable material may be available to us for use in our process or for sale. The final volume present and the ability to recover it are both highly speculative issues due to the area over which it is spread and the fragmented nature of the pockets of hydrocarbon. We have drilled additional wells periodically to further delineate the boundaries of the pools and to ensure that migration has not taken place. These tests confirmed that no migration of the hydrocarbon pools has occurred. The TCEQ has deemed the current action plan acceptable and reviews the plan on a semi-annual basis.

Personnel
The number of our regular, U.S. based employees was approximately 280, 324, and 310 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Of these employees, none are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Regular employees are defined as active executive, management, professional, technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for the Company and are covered by our benefit plans and programs. Our workforce has decreased primarily due to completion of capital projects at our facilities including a workforce downsizing at SHR in December 2018.
Competition
The specialty petrochemical, specialty wax, and mining industries are highly competitive. There is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the chemical and mineral needs of both industrial and individual consumers. We compete with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services and employ all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes. See further discussion in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Investment in AMAK
As of December 31, 2018, we owned a 33.4% interest in AMAK.
Location, Access and Transportation.
The facility site is located in Najran province in southwestern Saudi Arabia. Najran, the capital of the province of the same name, is approximately 700 km southeast of Jeddah. The site is located 145 km northwest of Najran, midway between the outpost of Rihab and the district town of Sufah. A modern, paved highway extends from Najran through the town of Habuna passing by the project site and on to Sufah. Another modern, paved highway extends west from the town of Tirima about 30 km to the Asir provincial line, becomes a four-lane divided highway, and intersects with a highway leading to Khamis Mushait and Abha. A joining highway then extends down the western slope of the Sarawat mountains to the coastal highway which follows the coast south to the Port of Jazan. The latter is the route AMAK's trucks carry concentrate to the port for export.
Conditions to Retain Title.
The Saudi government granted the Company a mining lease for the Al Masane area comprising approximately 44 square kilometers or approximately 10,870 acres on May 22, 1993 (the "Lease") under Royal Decree No. M/17. The Lease was assigned to AMAK in December 2008. The initial term of the Lease is thirty years beginning May 22, 1993, with AMAK having the option to renew or extend the term of the Lease for additional periods not to exceed twenty years. Under the Lease, AMAK is obligated to pay advance surface rental in the amount of 10,000 Saudi riyals (approximately $2,667 at the current exchange rate) per square kilometer per year (approximately $117,300 annually) during the term of the Lease. In addition, AMAK must pay income tax in accordance with the laws of Saudi Arabia and pay all infrastructure costs. The Lease gives the Saudi Arabian government priority to purchase any gold production from the project, as well as the right to purchase up to 10% of the annual production of other minerals on the same terms and conditions then available to other similar buyers and at current prices then prevailing in the free market. Furthermore, the Lease contains provisions requiring that preferences be given to Saudi Arabian suppliers and contractors and that AMAK employ Saudi Arabian citizens and provide training to Saudi Arabian personnel. In November 2015 AMAK received notification of final approval for additional licenses and leases. The approval includes an additional 151 square kilometers ("km2") of territory contiguous to AMAK's current 44 km2 mine. The new territory comprises the Guyan and Qatan exploration licenses covering 151 km2, and within the Guyan exploration license, a 10 km2 mining lease, which has potential for significant gold recovery. Under the new leases, AMAK is required to pay surface rental of SR 110,000 (approximately $29,333) for a period of 20 years expiring in 2035.
Rock Formations and Mineralization.
Three mineralized zones, the Saadah, Al Houra and Moyeath, have been outlined by diamond drilling. The Saadah and Al Houra zones occur in a volcanic sequence that consists of two mafic-felsic sequences with interbedded exhalative cherts and metasedimentary rocks. The Moyeath zone was discovered after the completion of underground development in 1980. It is located along an angular unconformity with underlying felsic volcanics and shales. The principle sulphide minerals in all of the zones are pyrite, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite. The precious metals occur chiefly in tetrahedrite and as tellurides and electrum.

Description of Current Property Condition.
The AMAK facility includes an underground mine, ore-treatment plant and related infrastructures. The ore-treatment plant is comprised of primary crushing, ore storage, SAG milling and pebble crushing, secondary ball milling, pre-flotation, copper and zinc flotation, concentrate thickening, tailings filtration, cyanide leaching, reagent handling, tailings dam and utilities. Related infrastructure includes a 300 man capacity camp for single status accommodation for expatriates and Saudi Arabian employees, an on-site medical facility, a service building for 300 employees, on-site diesel generation of 15 megawatts, potable water supply primarily from an underground aquifer, sewage treatment plant and an assay laboratory. The facilities at the Port of Jazan are comprised of unloading facilities, concentrate storage and reclamation and ship loading facilities. The above-ground ore processing facility became fully operational during the second half of 2012. Late in the fourth quarter of 2015, AMAK temporarily closed the operation to preserve the assets in the ground while initiating steps to improve efficiencies and optimize operations. The plant resumed operation in the fourth quarter of 2016 and operating rates, metal recoveries and concentrate quality has continued to improve throughout 2017 and 2018.
AMAK shipped approximately 58,000, 28,000, and 16,000 metric tons of copper and zinc concentrate to outside smelters during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. In 2014 AMAK initiated operation of its precious metal recovery circuit at the mill and produced gold and silver doré intermittently through 2014 and 2015. The precious metals circuit was recommissioned in the fourth quarter of 2017 and produced commercial quantities of gold and silver bearing doré in 2018.

Saudi Industrial Development Fund ("SIDF") Loan and Guarantee
On October 24, 2010, we executed a limited guarantee in favor of the SIDF guaranteeing up to 41% of the SIDF loan to AMAK in the principal amount of 330,000,000 Saudi Riyals (US$88,000,000) (the "Loan"). As a condition of the Loan, SIDF required all shareholders of AMAK to execute personal or corporate guarantees totaling 162.55% of the overall Loan amount. As ownership percentages have changed over time, the loan guarantee allocation has not changed. The other AMAK shareholders provided personal guarantees. We were the only AMAK shareholder providing a corporate guarantee. The loan was required in order for AMAK to fund construction of the underground and above-ground portions of its mining project in southwest Saudi Arabia and to provide working capital for commencement of operations. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounting Treatment of Investment in AMAK.
We have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of AMAK and therefore, account for it using the equity method. We have one representative on the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of AMAK. We also have one director who serves as Chair on the Commercial Committee of AMAK. AMAK is effectively self-operating under a new, experienced management team. See Note 10 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We assess our investment in AMAK for impairment when events are identified, or there are changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. We consider recoverable ore reserves, mineral prices, 
7

operational costs, and the amount and timing of the cash flows to be generated by the production of those reserves, as well as recent equity transactions within AMAK.
