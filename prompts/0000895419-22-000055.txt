Products
Silicon Carbide and GaN Materials
Our Silicon Carbide materials products consist of Silicon Carbide bare wafers, epitaxial wafers, and GaN epitaxial layers on Silicon Carbide wafers. Our Silicon Carbide materials are targeted for customers who use them to manufacture products for RF, power and other applications. Corporate, government and university customers also buy Silicon Carbide and GaN materials for research and development directed at RF and power devices.
Power Devices
Our power device products consist of Silicon Carbide Schottky diodes, metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) and power modules. Our Silicon Carbide power products provide increased efficiency and faster switching speeds and as a result, reduced system size and weight over comparable silicon power devices. Power products are sold to customers and distributors for use in applications such as electric vehicles, including charging infrastructure, server power supplies, solar inverters, uninterruptible power supplies, industrial power supplies and other applications.
RF Devices
Our RF devices consist of GaN-based die, high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs), and laterally diffused MOSFET (LDMOS) power transistors that are optimized for next generation telecommunications infrastructure, military and other commercial applications. Our RF devices are made from silicon, Silicon Carbide and GaN and can provide improved efficiency, bandwidths and frequency of operation as compared to silicon or gallium arsenide (GaAs). We also provide custom die manufacturing for GaN HEMTs and MMICs that allow a customer to design its own custom RF circuits to be fabricated by us, or have us design and fabricate products that meet their specific requirements.
Research and Development
We invest significant resources in research and development. Our research and development activity includes efforts to:
•develop Silicon Carbide materials and fabrication technology for a 200mm platform;
•develop higher performance power and RF devices;
•increase the quality, performance and diameter of our substrate and epitaxial materials; and
•continually improve our manufacturing processes.
When our customers participate in funding our research and development programs, we recognize the amount funded as a reduction of research and development expenses to the extent that our customers’ funding does not exceed our respective research and development costs. For further information about our research and development costs, see “Research and Development” in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Sales and Marketing
We have continued to make investments to expand our sales, marketing and technical applications support, as well as distribution capabilities to further enable new and existing customers to design and implement our Silicon Carbide and GaN materials, power, and RF technology into their products. We also have continued to make investments to promote and build market awareness of our Wolfspeed brand. Our sales, marketing and technical applications teams include personnel throughout North America, Asia and Europe.
Customers
In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we had two, three, and two customers that represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. These customers, in the aggregate, accounted for 38%, 41%, and 33% of our total consolidated revenue in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For further discussion regarding customer concentration, please see Note 16, “Concentrations of Risk,” in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The loss of any large customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Distribution
A portion of our products are sold to distributors. Distributors stock inventory and sell our products to their own customer base, which may include: value added resellers, manufacturers who incorporate our products into their own manufactured goods and ultimate end users of our products. We also utilize third-party sales representatives who generally do not maintain a product inventory; instead, their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors.
Backlog
Our backlog at June 26, 2022 was approximately $2.2 billion, compared with a backlog of approximately $763.9 million at June 27, 2021. Because of changes in a number of factors, including manufacturing lead times and customer order patterns, we do not believe that our backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of actual revenue for any future period. Significant amounts of our backlog relate to agreements that extend past one year.
Our June 26, 2022 backlog contained $20.0 million of research contracts signed with the U.S. Government, all of which were appropriated as of the last day of fiscal 2022. Our June 27, 2021 backlog contained $12.6 million of research contracts signed with the U.S. Government, all of which were appropriated as of the last day of fiscal 2021. Our backlog could be adversely affected if the U.S. Government exercises its rights to terminate our government contracts.
Manufacturing
We manufacture Silicon Carbide substrates, Silicon Carbide MOSFETs, Schottky diodes and power modules as well as GaN on Silicon Carbide RF devices and LDMOS power transistors. We utilize manufacturing facilities located in the United States in combination with assembly and test subcontractors throughout Asia. Manufacturing assets are managed together through one centralized organization to ensure we leverage scale in asset utilization, purchasing volumes, and overhead costs across the business.
Silicon Carbide substrate manufacturing occurs in our highly complex materials factory and involves production of a bare wafer substrate with or without epitaxy. Our front-end processes occur in manufacturing facilities called "wafer fabs". These processes involve several hundred manufacturing steps required for imprinting silicon carbide wafers with the precise circuitry required for semiconductor devices to function. Back-end processes include the assembly, test and packaging of semiconductors to make them suitable for use and sale.
Yields in our manufacturing process can vary and are dependent upon multiple factors including product complexity and performance requirements as well as the maturity of the process. In order to maximize both yield and quality, we maintain in-line process monitoring and testing.
Our substrate and wafer fab manufacturing facilities are certified to ISO 9001, IATF 16949 (automotive), and ISO 14001 (environmental). ISO 9001 is the international standard that specifies requirements for a quality management system and focuses on the ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer requirements. IATF 16949 is the highest international quality standard for the automotive industry. ISO 14001 is an internationally agreed upon standard for an environmental management system.
Sources of Raw Materials
We depend on a number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components and equipment used in manufacturing our products, including certain key materials and equipment used in critical stages of our manufacturing processes. In select cases, we have purchase contracts with suppliers in place to help insure our supply. In other cases, we purchase items pursuant to discrete purchase orders. Our suppliers are located around the world and can be subject to constraints beyond our control that may limit supply. We believe our current supply of essential materials is sufficient to meet our needs. However, shortages have occurred from time to time and could occur again.
For raw materials used in semiconductor production, the global semiconductor shortage has put pressure on the ability to obtain some raw materials. We have focused on forecasting demand further out in time in order to secure raw materials that may have extended lead times and we have been working with suppliers to develop purchase agreements that provide supply over extended time periods.
We are starting to experience higher prices on our raw materials as a result of inflation pressures, including base price increases and price surcharges. Additionally, we have continued to experience impacts with logistics, including increased freight costs and lower shipping capacities. We are closely following logistical impacts as they happen and are working closely with suppliers to prepare shipping arrangements in advance of departure dates to ensure we secure logistics slots.
We have and may continue to experience isolated issues with our suppliers related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These issues usually relate to extensions of lead times or impacts due to work force restrictions imposed at a regional level. When these occur, we closely monitor deliveries with suppliers to help us have the opportunity to decrease or eliminate any future delays.
We have been successful in managing through these issues and we believe our operations are currently not materially impacted by our ability to source raw materials, components and equipment used in manufacturing our products.
Competition
Silicon Carbide and GaN Materials
We have continued to maintain a well-established leadership position in the sale of Silicon Carbide wafer and Silicon Carbide and GaN epitaxy products. As market adoption of the technology grows with rapidly expanding power and RF device designs, we have experienced increased competition from companies such as II-VI Advanced Materials/Coherent, Inc., SiCrystal GmbH, IQE plc and Showa Denko K.K. We believe our leading technology and leveraged production scale position us to reliably supply production volumes to the device manufacturers in the market.
Power Devices
Our Silicon Carbide power devices compete with Silicon Carbide power semiconductor solutions offered by Infineon Technologies AG, ON Semiconductor Corporation, Rohm Co. Ltd., and ST Microelectronics, as well as an increasing number of smaller competitors. Our Silicon Carbide products also compete with silicon semiconductor devices offered by a variety of manufacturers. Our power products compete in the power semiconductor market on the basis of performance, reliability and overall system price.
RF Devices
Our RF devices compete with Ampleon Netherlands B.V., M/A-COM Technology Solutions Inc., BOWEI Integrated Circuits Co., Ltd., Mitsubishi, NXP Semiconductor N.V., RFHIC, Qorvo, Inc. and Sumitomo, which all offer competing RF products and solutions. Our products also compete with a variety of companies offering silicon and GaAs-based products. Our products compete in the RF semiconductor market on the basis of reliability, performance, design predictability and overall system price.
Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights
We believe it is important to protect our investment in technology by obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights, including rights under patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws. We seek to protect inventions we consider significant by applying for patents in the United States and other countries when appropriate. We have also acquired, through license grants, purchases and assignments, rights to patents on inventions originally developed by others. As of June 26, 2022, we owned or were the exclusive licensee of 675 issued U.S. patents and approximately 1,340 foreign patents with various expiration dates extending up to 2046, with certain patents expiring in the near term. We do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any one patent, and we believe our business will not be materially adversely affected by the expiration of any one patent. For proprietary technology that is not patented, we generally seek to protect the technology and related know-how and information as trade secrets by keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. We attempt to create strong brands for our products and promote our products through trademarks that distinguish them in the market. We may license to our customers use of our trademarks in connection with the sale of our products, and we monitor for the proper and authorized use of our trademarks.
Licensing activities and lawsuits to enforce intellectual property rights, particularly patent rights, are a common aspect of the semiconductor industry, and we attempt to ensure respect for our intellectual property rights through appropriate actions. The breadth of our intellectual property rights and the extent to which they can be successfully enforced varies across jurisdictions. We both make and receive inquiries regarding possible patent infringements and possible violations of other intellectual property rights in the normal course of business. Depending on the circumstances, we may seek to negotiate a license or other acceptable resolution. If we are unable to achieve a resolution by agreement, we may seek to enforce our rights or defend our position through litigation. Patent litigation in particular is expensive and the outcome is often uncertain. We believe that the strength of our portfolio of patent rights is important in helping us resolve or avoid such disputes with other companies in our industry.
Governmental Regulation
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These include statutory and regulatory provisions under which we are responsible for the management of hazardous materials we use and the disposition of hazardous wastes resulting from our manufacturing processes. Failure to comply with such provisions could result in fines and other liabilities to the government or third parties, injunctions requiring us to suspend or curtail operations or other remedies, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of semiconductor manufacturing operations. We, along with the rest of the semiconductor industry, are subject to variable interpretations and governmental priorities concerning environmental laws and regulations.
We endorse and adhere to Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) standards for all our sites. It is our EHS goal to design and develop products safely, that realize energy efficiency, minimize environmental impacts, and have sustainable life cycles. In this manner, we are striving to continuously improve our EHS performance and reduce the overall impacts of our manufacturing processes. To further ensure that we can implement such standards, we are dedicated to:
•providing a safe and healthy work environment for our employees;
•complying with regulatory and other requirements;
•using natural resources, energy, and materials efficiently;
•substituting sustainable resources in place of non-renewable resources;
•reusing or recycling materials wherever technically possible and economically reasonable;
•minimizing waste and disposing of waste safely and responsibly;
•sourcing raw material responsibly;
•implementing specific measures to prevent and minimize hazards to humans; and the environment including pollution prevention; and
•consulting with and encouraging the participation of workers and workers’ representatives, as applicable.
Our EHS management systems in our manufacturing facilities in Durham and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina and Morgan Hill, California are certified to ISO 14001:2015 for environmental management. The benefits of implementing environmental and safety management systems include improved risk management, cost savings, meeting external stakeholder expectations, ensuring compliance with environmental and occupational safety laws, and decreasing our environmental footprint through discovering new possibilities for energy, water and waste usage reductions.
We are also subject to import-export controls, tariffs and other trade-related regulations and restrictions in countries in which we have operations or otherwise do business. These controls, tariffs, regulations, and restrictions (including those related to, or affected by, United States-China relations, as discussed below in Item 1A of this Report) may have a material impact on our business, including our ability to sell products and to manufacture or source components.
Working Capital
For a discussion of our working capital practices, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Human Capital
Employees
As of June 26, 2022, we employed 4,017 regular full and part-time employees. We also employ individuals on a temporary full-time basis and use the services of contractors as necessary. Certain employees in various countries outside of the United States are subject to laws providing representation rights.
Employee Retention and Development
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel. Core to our ability to attract and retain talent is our high-performance culture, which is based on our three central values of (1) integrity and respect, (2) ownership and accountability, and (3) ingenuity and passion. We are committed to creating and sustaining a culture where all employees are engaged and can contribute to their full potential. We aim to provide our employees with competitive compensation, as well as opportunities for equity ownership and developmental programs that enable continued learning and growth. We endeavor to utilize recruiting practices that yield qualified and dedicated employees who are driven to achieve our vision. 
We are committed to offering an environment in which employees are ensured equal job opportunities and have a chance for advancement. We also have initiatives in place to reduce our global employee turnover rates, which are monitored and reviewed quarterly. Our goal is to ensure employees can find development and career growth without having to leave Wolfspeed.
Compensation and Benefits
We are focused on offering competitive compensation and comprehensive benefit packages designed to promote the physical and emotional well-being and financial health of our employees. Our total compensation package includes base pay, bonuses, stock-based compensation, employee stock purchase plans, employee referral bonuses, adoption assistance and a family care program.
Health and Safety
The safety, health, and overall well-being of our employees and contractors is integrated into the way we do business. We aim to provide a safe and healthy work environment through various measures, including accountability for health and safety performance with line management, setting acceptable levels of risk based on government regulation or industry best practice, and evaluating health and safety incidents to prevent recurrence, among other programs.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety protocols and new procedures to protect our employees, customers and suppliers. In line with guidance from the World Health Organization, Center for Disease Control, local health authorities and other governmental authorities, we have implemented numerous preventative hygiene and safety measures at our facilities, and moved to a fully remote work model for employees who were able to perform their job duties from an off-campus location. As the pandemic continues, the health and well-being of our workforce remains a top priority while we work to ensure productivity for those employees working from home. Recently, some employees have returned to working in the office, however, we also offer a 'work where it works' arrangement that allows certain employees to continue to have the option of working remotely part-time or full-time.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe diversity, equity, and inclusion drives better business results and makes all of us better employees and people. We are striving to build an environment where inclusivity is real and active, rather than theoretical and static. We celebrate our employees’ differences and authenticity, and understand that diverse ideas, perspectives, thinking styles, and backgrounds produce higher quality decisions, enabling us to solve problems other companies consider to be impossible. Our efforts to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace include Employee Resources Groups, a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion leadership team that partners with our Human Resources department and various scholarship programs in our surrounding communities. We believe these initiatives help contribute to the development of future leaders, increased employee engagement and expanded market reach.
