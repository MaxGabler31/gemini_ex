Historical Background
 
We were incorporated in the State of New Jersey on October 1, 2003 under the name of Creative Beauty Supply of New Jersey Corporation, and subsequently changed our name to Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc. on May 18, 2015. We commenced operations in the beauty supply industry as of January 1, 2004. On November 30, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose of our wholesale and retail beauty supply business. From January 1, 2009 until July 28, 2017, we had no operations and were a shell company.
 
On March 16, 2017, our Board of Directors adopted resolutions, which were approved by shareholders holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to change our name to “IIOT-OXYS, Inc.”, to authorize a change of domicile from New Jersey to Nevada, to authorize a 2017 Stock Awards Plan, and to approve the Securities Exchange Agreement (the “OXYS SEA”) between the Company and OXYS Corporation (“OXYS”), a Nevada corporation incorporated on August 4, 2016.
 
Under the terms of the OXYS SEA we acquired 100% of the issued voting shares of OXYS in exchange for 34,687,244 shares of our Common Stock. We also cancelled 1,500,000 outstanding shares of our Common Stock and changed our management to Mr. DiBiase who also served in management of OXYS. Also, one of our principal shareholders entered into a consulting agreement with OXYS to provide consulting services during the transition. The OXYS SEA was effective on July 28, 2017, and our name was changed to “IIOT-OXYS, Inc.” at that time. Effective October 26, 2017, our domicile was changed from New Jersey to Nevada.
 
On December 14, 2017, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “HereLab SEA”) with HereLab, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“HereLab”), and HereLab’s two shareholders pursuant to which we would acquire all the issued and outstanding shares of HereLab in exchange for the issuance of 1,650,000 shares of our Common Stock, on a pro rata basis, to HereLab’s two shareholders. The closing of the transaction occurred on January 11, 2018 and HereLab became our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
At the present time, we have two, wholly-owned subsidiaries which are OXYS Corporation and HereLab, Inc., through which our operations are conducted.
 
General Overview
 
IIOT-OXYS, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), and OXYS, were originally established for the purposes of designing, building, testing, and selling Edge Computing systems for the Industrial Internet. Both companies were, and presently are, early stage technology startups that are largely pre-revenue in their development phase. HereLab is also an early-stage technology development company. The Company received its first revenues in the last quarter of 2017, has continued to realize revenues in 2021, and expects to realize revenue growth in 2022 due to its business development pipeline.
 
We develop hardware, software and algorithms that monitor, measure and predict conditions for energy, structural, agricultural and medical applications. We use domain-specific Artificial Intelligence to solve industrial and environmental challenges. Our engineered solutions focus on common sense approaches to machine learning, algorithm development and hardware and software products. We design a system of hardware and software, assemble, install, monitor data and apply our algorithms to help provide the customer insights.
 
We use off the shelf components, with reconfigurable hardware architecture that adapts to a wide range of customer needs and applications. We use open-source software tools, while still creating proprietary content for customers, thereby reducing software development time and cost. The software works with the hardware to collect data from the equipment or structure that is being monitored.

We focus on developing insights. We develop algorithms that help our customers create insights from vast data streams.  The data collected is analyzed and reports are created for the customer. From these insights, the customer can act to improve their process, product or structure.
 
OUR SOLUTIONS ACHIEVE TWO OBJECTIVES
 
ADD VALUE
 

· | We show clear path to improved asset reliability, machine uptime, machine utilization, energy consumption, and quality.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We provide advanced algorithms and insights as a service.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

RISK MINIMIZATION
 

· | We use simple measurements which are minimally invasive.
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | We do not interfere with command and control of critical equipment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We do not interfere with machine control networks.

HOW WE DO IT
 
Our location in Cambridge, Massachusetts is ideal since market-leading Biotech, Medtech, and Pharma multinational firms have offices or R&D centers in Cambridge or the Greater Boston area, which gives us easier access to potential sales which, in turn, lowers our cost of sales. Additionally, we continue to add value to structural health monitoring and smart manufacturing customers as well. We, therefore, have a range of opportunities as we continue to expand our customer base.
 
Our goal is to help Biotech, Pharma, and Medical Device companies realize the next wave of performance, productivity, and quality gains for their organizations, and become Industry 4.0 compliant.
 
We have a unique value proposition in a fast-growing worldwide multi-billion USD market, and have positioned our business with strategic partners for accelerated growth. We are therefore well-poised for growth in 2022 and beyond, as we execute our plans and acquire additional customers.
 
WHAT MARKETS WE SERVE
 
SMART MANUFACTURING
 
We help our customers maintain machine uptime and maximize operational efficiency. We also enable then to do energy monitoring, predictive maintenance that anticipates problems before they happen, and improve part and process quality.
BIOTECH, PHARMACEUTICAL, AND MEDICAL DEVICES
 
We are on the operations side, not the patient-facing side. In this market vertical, our customers must provide high-quality products that must also pass rigorous review by governing bodies such as the FDA. Here again, we focus on machine uptime, operational efficiency, and predictive maintenance to avoid unplanned downtime.

SMART INFRASTRUCTURE
 
For bridges and other civil infrastructure, local, state and federal agencies have limited resources. We help our clients prioritize how to spend limited funds by addressing those fixes which need to be made first.
OUR UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION
 
EDGE COMPUTING AS A COMPLIMENT TO CLOUD COMPUTING
 
Within the Internet of Things (“IoT”) and Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”), most companies right now are adopting an approach which sends all sensor data to the cloud for processing. We specialize in edge computing, where the data processing is done locally right where the data is collected. We also have advanced cloud-based algorithms that implement various machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms.
ADVANCED ALGORITHMS
 
We have sought to differentiate from our competitors by developing advanced algorithms on our own and in collaboration with strategic partners These algorithms are an essential part of the edge computing strategy that convert raw data into actionable knowledge right where the data is collected without having to send the data to the cloud first.
RECONFIGURABLE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE
 
Instead of focusing on creating tools, we use open-source tools to create proprietary content.
 
Marketing
 
Our marketing and sales efforts are divided into several distinct categories:
 

1) | We work with partners to leverage their sales and marketing channels. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Direct business development and discussions with end use customers by company management; and
3) | Trade shows and international technical, sales and marketing meetings. 

Competition
 
We have two principal sources of competition. The first comes from large companies such as Siemens, PTC, IBM, GE, Amazon, Google, etc., who all have their efforts in IIoT. However, these large companies are cloud – computing centric and they are trying to move towards edge devices from their present position of being solely cloud computing based. We will be starting in edge computing from day one as opposed to force-fitting a cloud-based solution into the limited computational capability and storage space of an edge device. We believe our systems will be more computationally efficient as compared to a cloud-based solution which requires more computational resources.
 
The second source of competition is from startups who are in the edge computing space. Examples are FogHorn Systems Inc., Tulip Interfaces, and MachineSense. There will be additional startups that will specifically target the edge computing space as the investor awareness and the technical focus shifts from cloud computing to edge computing. Whereas other startups focus on development of proprietary tools for edge computing, our solutions will use open source tools but will still create proprietary algorithms and software content for clients and customers. We feel this methodology of creating proprietary solutions using open source tools will allow us to rapidly address current and future customer needs.

Government Regulation
 
At present, we do not require any governmental approvals of any of our products or services.
 
Environmental Laws
 
At present, we are not regulated by any environmental laws.
 
Research and Development
 
We work with our partners and universities to develop IP; we will further develop this IP in house into products and services.
 
Other than expenses for legal, accounting, audit, tax preparation, intellectual property (IP), and other overhead expenses such rent, most of our funds are spent on technology development, product development, and research and development. We are an emerging growth, early-stage, technology company and, as such, most of our expenditures are aimed at innovation and product development.
 
The efforts in research and development have already resulted in significant customer interest in various market verticals including industrial, automotive, aerospace, agricultural, infrastructure, and power generation.
 
Intellectual Property
 
On February 5, 2018, we entered into a Non-Exclusive Patent License Agreement with MIT. The agreement, which was effective February 1, 2018, granted to us a royalty-bearing non-exclusive license under U.S. Patent Nos. 8344724 (“Non-Intrusive Monitoring of Power and Other Parameters” issued January 1, 2013), 14/263407 (“Non-Intrusive Monitoring” filed April 28, 2014), and Patent Cooperation Treaty Serial No. PCT/US2016/057165 (“Noncontact Power Sensing” filed October 14, 2016) during the term of the agreement. The term of the agreement was from the effective date until the expiration or abandonment of all issued patents and filed patent applications licensed pursuant to the agreement, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the agreement.
 
Under the agreement, we were required to make a first commercial sale of a “LICENSED PRODUCT” and/or a first commercial performance of a “LICENSED PROCESS,” as defined in the agreement, on or before September 30, 2018. We had negotiated revenue targets with MIT which would determine annual royalty payments. The 2018 minimum revenue target for the sale of products and services incorporating the MIT technology was $100,000. This minimum revenue amount would increase in subsequent years.
 
Within 30 days of invoicing, a non-refundable license issue fee of $10,000 was paid by us to MIT. Pursuant to the agreement, we were required to pay to MIT additional patent maintenance fees in years beyond 2018.
 
Pursuant to the agreement, we were required to pay to MIT a running royalty of 2% of “NET SALES,” as defined in the agreement made in the calendar years 2018, 2019, and 2020. For “NET SALES” made in the calendar year 2021 and every calendar year thereafter through the term of the agreement, we were required to pay to MIT a running royalty of 4%.
 
On October 31, 2018, we sent written notice of our intent to terminate the agreement with an effective date of termination of April 30, 2019. Since none of the technology licensed to us by MIT had been used by us in any of our products and we had been investing in the development of our own intellectual property, we determined the technology that was licensed from MIT wasn’t necessary in the near term. Due to this, the written notice sent by us expressed a desire by our management to renegotiate the terms of the agreement with MIT.
 
MIT declined to renegotiate the terms of the agreement and, on December 6, 2018, we received a notice of termination from MIT due to non-payment of fees. As of December 6, 2018, the agreement was terminated, fees are no longer accruing, interest is accruing and $76,283.88 in fees owed to MIT are still owing as of the date of this Annual Report. Despite the termination of the Agreement, we remain active with MIT as a member of the MIT Startup Exchange (STEX). The purpose of STEX is to promote collaboration and partnerships between MIT-connected startups and members of MIT’s Industrial Liaison Program. We remain open to future mutually acceptable agreements with MIT.

We continue to develop our proprietary algorithms and plan to protect them through a combination of trade secret, copyright, and patents.
 
Customers
 
Due to our status of a start-up, at the moment, we depend on a few major customers. This should change as we implement plans for future growth.
Employees
 
As of April 8, 2022, we have two employees, each on W2’s, not including the CEO and COO. Although the consulting agreements of our CEO and COO terminated in 2021, we expect to have new agreements in place during the second quarter of 2022. Besides our CEO and COO, one employee is full time and the remaining is part time.
 
At the present time, except for the funding received from Cambridge MedSpace LLC and Vidhyadhar Mitta in the form of secured notes, there are no conflicts of interest between the Company and any of our officers and directors. This was determined as follows: i) none of their outside activities are soliciting business from our customers or business contacts; ii) they are not soliciting our investors to invest in other ventures; and iii) they are not soliciting our contract employees to leave us and join other efforts. At present, all our business services are provided by outside contractors.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
