ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Overview
 
BoxScore Brands, Inc. (formerly U-Vend Inc.) (the “Company”) develops, markets and distributes various self-serve electronic kiosks and mall/airport co-branded islands throughout North America. The Company seeks to place its kiosks in high-traffic host locations such as big box stores, restaurants, malls, airports, casinos, universities, and colleges. Currently, the Company leases, owns and operates their kiosks, and intends in the future to also provide the kiosks, through a distributor relationship, to the entrepreneur wanting to own their own business.
Technology
 
The Company’s “next-generation” vending kiosks incorporate advanced wireless technology, creative concepts, and ease of management. Its kiosks have been designed to be tech-savvy and can be managed online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, accepting traditional cash payment, as well as credit and debit cards. Host locations and suppliers have been drawn to this distribution concept of product vending based on the advantages of reduced labor and lower product theft as compared to non-kiosk merchandising platforms.
Distribution
 
Currently, the Company distributes a novelty ice cream product, Mini Melts, through a network of over 140 vending kiosks and over 140 small merchandiser freezers. The Company procured all its merchandise of inventory of finished goods ice cream from a single vendor during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Marketing
 
The Company takes a ‘solutions development’ approach for the marketing of products through a variety of kiosk offerings. This approach has the ability to add digital LCD monitors to most makes and models of their kiosk program. This allows the digital advertising as a national and/or local-loop basis, and represents a corresponding additional revenue stream for the Company.
Licensing
 
The Company entered into a license agreement effective as of January 1, 2016 and continuing through December 31, 2019 with Major League Baseball Properties, Inc. (“MLB”) for the non-exclusive right to certain proprietary intangible property of the MLB to be used in connection with the manufacturing, distribution, promotion and advertisement of an ice cream novelty product to be sold within the U.S., the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. The Company plans to sell pallets of MLB ice cream to large national wholesale distributors as well as through reach-in MLB branded freezers which include a digital advertising screen. The Company received an initial purchase order for pallets of MLB ice cream in May 2018 and shipped this product in June. In November, 2017, the Company extended its agreement with MLB initially through calendar year 2018, and subsequently through 2019. Additionally, the Company has a revenue sharing agreement with MLB for on screen advertising at Point-of-Sale. 
 
In March, 2015, the Company entered into a 5 year license and sponsorship agreement with the National Hockey League (“NHL”) and does not have a date when it expects to ship product under this agreement. The Company is currently in discussions with the NHL and may modify certain terms of this agreement with the NHL prior to shipping product. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the Company and the NHL agreed to terminate the agreement forgiving the Company CAD3,450,000 in outstanding obligations under the agreement, in return the Company agreed to pay the NHL an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the Company’s net sales of certain products as defined under the agreement. See note 13, Subsequent Events.

As of August 24, 2018, the Company had over 400 customers. The Company’s marketing activities are conducted through both a direct sales force and sales representatives.
