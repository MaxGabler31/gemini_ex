Item 1. Business.
​
Overview
​
We design, develop, produce, deliver and support a technologically-advanced portfolio of intelligent, multi-domain robotic systems and related services for government agencies and businesses. We supply unmanned aircraft systems (“UAS”), tactical missile systems (“TMS”), unmanned ground vehicles (“UGV”) and related services primarily to organizations within the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) and to international allied governments. We derive the majority of our revenue from these business areas, and we believe that the markets for these solutions offer the potential for significant long-term growth. Additionally, we believe that some of the innovative potential products, services and technologies in our research and development pipeline will emerge as new growth platforms in the future, creating additional market opportunities.
​
The success of our current product and service offering stems from our investments in research and development to invent and deliver advanced solutions, utilizing proprietary and commercially available technologies, and in acquiring leading businesses that help our customers achieve their desired outcomes. We develop and acquire these highly innovative solutions by working closely with our key customers to solve their most important challenges related to our areas of expertise. Our core technological capabilities, developed through more than 45 years of innovation, include robotics and robotics systems autonomy; sensor design, development, miniaturization and integration; embedded software and firmware; miniature, low power, secure wireless digital communications and networks; lightweight aerostructures; high-altitude systems design, integration and operations; machine vision, machine

learning and autonomy; land, maritime and air deployment of missile and aircraft systems; design and qualification for robotics in extreme terrestrial and space environments; miniature internal combustion engine propulsion design and integration; missile systems warhead integration; low SWaP (Size, Weight and Power) system design and integration; manned-unmanned teaming and unmanned-unmanned teaming; power electronics and electric propulsion systems; efficient electric power conversion, storage systems and high density energy packaging; controls and systems integration; vertical takeoff and landing flight, fixed wing flight and hybrid aircraft flight; image stabilization and target tracking; advanced flight control systems; fluid dynamics; human-machine interface development; and integrated mission solutions for austere or extreme environments.
​
Our business focuses primarily on the design, development, production, marketing, support and operation of innovative UAS, TMS and UGV that provide situational awareness, remote sensing, multi-band communications, force protection and other information and mission effects to increase the safety and effectiveness of our customers’ operations.
​
Our Strategy
​
As a technology solutions provider, our strategy is to grow our business by delivering innovative, safe and reliable multi-domain solutions that provide customers with valuable capabilities. Delivering these capabilities will enable us to create new markets or market segments, gain share in existing markets and grow as market adoption increases. We believe that by introducing new solutions, or acquiring differentiated solutions developed by others, that provide customers with compelling value, we can grow our business profitably, both in new and existing markets. By providing differentiated solutions we believe we can compete effectively against large, incumbent competitors that may possess advantages in scope, scale, resources and relationships.
​
We intend to grow our business by preserving a leadership position in our core UAS, TMS and UGV markets, and by creating or acquiring new solutions and capabilities that enable us to establish leadership positions in new markets. Key components of this strategy include the following:
​
Expand the market penetration of existing products and services. Our small UAS and medium UAS (“MUAS”), TMS and UGV enjoy leading positions in their respective markets. We intend to increase the penetration of our small UAS and MUAS and UGV products and services within the U.S. military, the military forces of allied nations, other government agencies and non-government organizations, including commercial entities, and to increase the penetration of our TMS within the U.S. military and within the military forces of allied nations. We believe that the broad adoption of our small UAS and MUAS and TMS by the U.S. military will continue to spur demand by allied nations, and that our efforts to pursue new applications are creating opportunities beyond the early adopter military market. Similarly, we expect the adoption of our UGV solutions to expand our presence in the U.S. military market.
​
Deliver innovative new solutions into existing and new markets. Customer-focused innovation is the primary driver of our growth. We plan to continue investing in internally-funded research and development projects while expanding our pursuit of customer-funded research and development projects to generate revenue and develop better, more capable products, services and business models, both in response to and in anticipation of emerging customer needs. In some cases, these innovations result in upgrades to existing offerings, expanding their value among existing customers and markets. In other cases, these innovations become entirely new solutions that position us to address new markets, customers and business opportunities. We believe focused research and development investments will allow us to deliver innovative new products and services that address market needs within and outside of our current target markets and enable us to create new opportunities for growth. We view strategic partnerships as means by which to further the reach of our innovative solutions through access to new markets, customers and complementary capabilities. We also consider acquisitions as a method to obtain valuable products, capabilities or technologies that can further enable our growth strategy.
​
Foster our entrepreneurial culture and continue to attract, develop and retain highly-skilled personnel. Our company culture encourages innovation and entrepreneurialism, which helps to attract and retain highly-skilled professionals. We intend to preserve this culture to encourage the development of the innovative, highly technical system solutions and business models that give us our competitive advantage. Our values of “customer commitment,” 

4



“trust and teamwork,” “innovate and simplify,” and “ownership and results” serve as the foundation of our culture. We believe that our values help to guide the behavior of our team members and serve to maintain a positive work environment that inspires loyalty among our personnel and customers. We also believe that our values facilitate the integration of new team members who join us as a result of acquisitions.
​
Preserve our agility and flexibility. We respond rapidly to evolving markets, solve complicated customer problems, and strive to deliver new products, services and capabilities quickly, efficiently and affordably relative to available alternatives. We believe our agility and flexibility help us to strengthen our relationships with customers and partners. We intend to maintain our agility and flexibility, which we believe to be important sources of differentiation when we compete against organizations with more extensive resources.
​
Effectively manage our growth portfolio for long-term value creation. Our production and development programs and services present numerous investment opportunities that we believe will deliver long-term growth by providing our customers with valuable new capabilities. We evaluate each opportunity independently, as well as within the context of other investment opportunities, to determine its relative cost, timing and potential for generation of returns, and thereby its priority. This process helps us to make informed decisions regarding potential growth capital requirements and supports our allocation of resources based on relative risks and returns to maximize long-term value creation, which is the key objective of our growth strategy. We also review our portfolio on a regular basis to determine if and when to narrow our focus on the highest potential growth opportunities. 
​
Customers
​
We sell the majority of our UAS and services to organizations within the U.S. DoD, including the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, Special Operations Command, Air Force and Navy, and to allied governments. We sell our TMS and services to organizations within the U.S. DoD and allied military forces. We sell our UGV and services to U.S. and allied government military and public safety agencies as well as to commercial entities. We also develop High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite (“HAPS”) systems in conjunction with SoftBank Corp (“SoftBank”).
​
During our fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, we generated approximately 21% of our revenue from the U.S. Army pursuant to orders placed under contract by the U.S. Army on behalf of itself as well as for several other organizations within the DoD. Other U.S. government agencies and government subcontractors accounted for 37% of our sales revenue, and HAPSMobile Inc. (“HAPSMobile”) and SoftBank together accounted for 10% of our sales revenue. Sales revenue to foreign customers other than HAPSMobile and Softbank, inclusive of foreign military sales made through the DoD, commercial and consumer customers accounted for the remaining 32% of sales revenue during our fiscal year ended April 30, 2022.
​
Environmental
​
We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could also be affected by future laws and regulations relating to climate change, including laws related to greenhouse gas emissions and regulating energy efficiency. These laws and regulations could lead to increased environmental compliance expenditures, increased energy and raw materials costs and new and/or additional investment in designs and technologies. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. While environmental protection regulations have not had a significant adverse effect on our overall operations, it is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance in the future could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.

Technology, Research and Development
​
Technological Competence and Intellectual Property
​
Our company was founded by the late Dr. Paul B. MacCready, the former Chairman of our board of directors and an internationally renowned innovator who was instrumental in establishing our entrepreneurial and creative culture. This culture has consistently enabled us to attract and retain highly-motivated, talented employees and has established our reputation as an innovative leader in the industries in which we compete.
​
The innovations developed by our company and our founder include, among others: the world’s first effective human-powered and manned solar-powered airplanes; the first modern passenger electric car, the EV1 prototype for General Motors; the world’s highest flying airplane in level flight, Helios™, a solar-powered unmanned aircraft system that reached over 96,000 feet above sea level in 2001; Global Observer, the world’s first liquid hydrogen-fueled unmanned aircraft system; the Nano Hummingbird™, the world’s first flapping wing unmanned aircraft system capable of precise hover and omni-directional flight; and Blackwing™, the first submarine-launched unmanned aircraft system deployed by the U.S. Navy and a considerable portion of JPL/NASA’s Mars Ingenuity Helicopter, the first aircraft to perform a powered flight on another planet. The Smithsonian Institution possesses seven vehicles developed by our company or our founder in its permanent collection. Our history of innovation excellence is the result of our talented, creative and skilled employees whom we encourage to invent and develop innovative new solutions.
​
A component of our ongoing innovation is a screening process that helps our business managers identify early market needs, which assists us in making timely investments into critical technologies necessary to develop solutions to address these needs. Similarly, we manage new product and business concepts through a commercialization process that balances spending, resources, time and intellectual property considerations against market requirements and potential returns on investment. Strongly linking our technology and business development activities to customer needs in attractive growth markets constitutes an important element of this process. Through this process we revisit our customer requirement assumptions to evaluate continued investment and to seek to ensure that our products and services deliver high value.
​
As of April 30, 2022, we had issued and retained 256 U.S. patents, as well as 63 pending U.S. patent applications; 15 active Patent Cooperation Treaty applications; and numerous foreign patents and pending applications. In many cases, when appropriate and to preserve confidentiality, we opt to protect our intellectual property through trade secrets as opposed to filing for patent protection.
​
The U.S. government has licenses to some of our intellectual property that was specifically developed in performance of government contracts and may use or authorize others to use this intellectual property. In some cases, we fund the development of certain intellectual property to maximize its value and limit its use by potential competitors. While we consider the development and protection of our intellectual property to be integral to the future success of our business, at this time we do not believe that a loss or limitation of rights to any particular piece of our intellectual property would have a material adverse effect on our overall business.
​
Research, Development and Commercialization Projects
​
A core component of our business strategy is the focused development and commercialization of innovative solutions that we believe can become new products or services that enable us to create large new markets or accelerate the growth of our current markets. We invest in an active pipeline of these commercialization projects that range in maturity from technology validation to early market adoption. We cannot predict when, if ever, we will successfully commercialize these projects, or the exact level of capital expenditures they could require, which could be substantial.
​
Sales and Marketing
​
Our marketing strategy is based on establishing leadership positions in new markets that we create through the introduction or acquisition of innovation solutions that improve customer operational effectiveness and efficiency. Our ability to operate in an agile, flexible manner helps us achieve first mover advantage and work closely with early 

6



customers to achieve the successful adoption of our solutions. Once we establish a market position, we work to maintain our leadership, while seeking to grow our revenue by expanding sales and through continuous innovation and customer support. Our reputation for innovation is a key component of our brand and has been acknowledged through a variety of awards and recognized in numerous articles in domestic and international publications. We have many U.S. registered trademarks including those for AeroVironment, AV, Switchblade, Raven, Wasp, Quantix, VAPOR, Arcturus UAV, Crysalis and Jump and have several pending applications for trademark registration.
​
International Sales
​
We contract with international sales representatives and team with domestic organizations in a number of foreign markets and believe that these markets represent growth opportunities for our business. Our international sales, inclusive of foreign military sales, accounted for approximately 41%, 39% and 45%, of our revenue for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
​
Competition
​
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets for our products and services include product performance; safety; features; acquisition cost; lifetime operating cost, including maintenance and support; ease of use; rapid integration with existing equipment and processes; quality; reliability; customer support; and brand and reputation.
​
Manufacturing and Operations
​
We pursue a lean and efficient production strategy across our business, focusing on rapid prototyping, supply chain management, final assembly, integration, quality and final acceptance testing. Using concurrent engineering techniques within an integrated product team structure, we rapidly prototype design concepts and products, while working to optimize our designs to meet manufacturing requirements, mission capabilities and customer specifications. Within this framework we develop our products with feedback and input from manufacturing, quality, supply chain management, key suppliers, logistics personnel and customers. We incorporate this input into product designs in an effort to maximize the efficiency and quality of our products while minimizing time to market. As a result, we believe that we significantly reduce the time required to move a product from its design phase to full rate production, while achieving high reliability, quality and yields.
​
We outsource certain production activities, such as the fabrication of certain aerostructures, the manufacture and assembly of electronic printed circuit boards, and payload components to qualified suppliers, with many of whom we have long-term relationships. This outsourcing enables us to focus on our core expertise of final assembly, system integration and test processes for our products, ensuring high levels of quality and reliability. We forge strong relationships with key suppliers based on their ability to grow with our production needs and support our growth plans. We continue to expand upon our suppliers’ expertise to improve our existing products and develop new solutions. We rely on both single and multiple suppliers for certain components and subassemblies. (See Part 1A, “Risk Factors—If critical components or raw materials used to manufacture our products or used in our development programs become scarce or unavailable, then we may incur delays in manufacturing and delivery of our products and in completing our development programs, which could damage our business.” for more information.) A majority of our production systems operate in accordance with our AS9100D registered Quality Management System, which focuses on continuous improvement in order to increase acceptance rates, reduce lead times and lower cost.
​
Customer Funded Research and Development
​
We actively pursue externally funded projects that help us to strengthen our technological capabilities. We submit bids to large research customers, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Army and the U.S. Special Operations Command, for projects that we believe have the potential for future procurement. In some cases, commercial enterprises may fund our research and development activities, as with our HAPS UAS development program. Providing these services contributes to the development and enhancement of our technical competencies. We carefully manage the volume of customer funded research and development projects based on projects’ available resources and expect to expand our team to support growth in this area of our business.

​
Seasonality
​
No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal. Historically, our revenue in the second half of our fiscal years has exceeded our revenue in the first half of our fiscal years. The factors that affect our revenue recognition between accounting periods include the timing of new contract awards, the availability of U.S. government and international government funding, lead time to manufacture our family of systems to customer specification, customer acceptance and other regulatory requirements.
​
Raw Materials and Suppliers
​
We are dependent upon the availability of materials and major components and the performance of our suppliers. Historically, we have been successful in obtaining the materials required in our manufacturing processes. We seek to manage materials supply risk through long term non-binding contracts with certain key suppliers that establish pricing, minimize lead times and to some degree mitigate risk. We have recently experienced supply chain challenges including shortages of certain electronic and other components, increased lead times, increased costs for components, and increased shipping, warehousing and inventory costs. We believe all of these raw materials and components are available to meet our needs from various suppliers; however, we expect inflationary and supply chain constraint trends to continue throughout our fiscal year 2023, which could cause delays in production and development programs and negatively impact our operating results. (See Part 1A, “Risk Factors—If critical components or raw materials used to manufacture our products or used in our development programs become scarce or unavailable, then we may incur delays in manufacturing and delivery of our products and in completing our development programs, which could damage our business.” for more information.)

​
As of April 30, 2022, we had 1,214 full time employees and 9 part time employees, of whom 434 were in research and development and engineering, 53 were in sales and marketing, 521 were in operations and 206 were general and administrative personnel.
​
Talent Acquisition, Retention and Development
​
Our ability to attract, develop and retain top talent, particularly those with technical and engineering backgrounds or experience, is critical for us to execute our strategy and grow our businesses. We continuously monitor the hiring, retention and management of our employees. An integral part of our people strategy is early career hiring through college and intern pipelines, particularly in technical fields. We regularly conduct confidential surveys to seek feedback from our employees and use those results to improve our workplace. We attract and reward our employees by providing market competitive compensation and benefits, including incentives and recognition plans that extend to all levels in our organization. We invest in our workforce through education, training and development programs and offer tuition assistance programs for continuing education or industry certifications. Additionally, we regularly conduct succession planning for management to ensure that we continue to cultivate the leadership pipeline of talent needed to execute our strategy.
​
Diversity and Inclusion
​
At AeroVironment, creating a culture of diversity and inclusion is something we work on every day. We believe that a diverse workforce and an inclusive workplace is a major catalyst for driving innovation. We have focused our diversity and inclusion initiatives on employee recruitment, including investments in minority-serving institutions and outreach, employee training and development, such as efforts focused on expanding the diverse talent pipeline, and employee engagement, including through participation in employee focus groups on various topics related to diversity and inclusion.
​
Employee Safety and Health
​
Our safety and health program seeks to optimize our operations through targeted safety, health and wellness opportunities designed to ensure safe work conditions, create a healthy work environment, promote workforce resiliency and enhance business value. We monitor employee health and safety measures, including monthly and yearly targets for employee injury and illness incidents, incidents that result in work days lost, and the number of work days lost due to workplace injuries and illness. We also provide our employees with health and wellness benefits.
​
We took and continue to take various measures to protect our workforce in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We implemented and continue to maintain extensive safety protocols to support our employees working onsite, such as enhanced cleaning of common areas. Additionally, in mid-March 2020, a significant portion of our workforce began teleworking in accordance with the implementation of government orders and guidance affecting our facilities. We have implemented a COVID-19 reporting mechanism for illness or exposure and positive COVID-19 tests. As part of that reporting process, we have a robust contact tracing program to identify employees who were in close contact with the ill employee in the workplace. In addition, we implemented a COVID-19 vaccination requirement for our employees, allowing for exceptions as required under applicable law and regulations, and continue to monitor potential vaccine mandates. We provide several channels for all employees to speak up, ask for guidance, and report concerns related ethics or safety concerns, including identifying areas for improvement. We address employee concerns and take appropriate actions that uphold our AeroVironment values. We have also implemented a flexible work location policy to allow employees who can meet our customer commitments while working remotely to continue to work remotely. We continue to ensure that employees working remotely have the technology, office equipment and other services needed to enable them to work effectively.

Backlog
​
Consistent with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), we define backlog as remaining unsatisfied performance obligations under firm orders for which work has not been performed. As of April 30, 2022 and 2021, our backlog was approximately $210.8 million and $211.8 million, respectively. We expect that approximately 93% of our backlog will be recognized as revenue during our fiscal year ending April 30, 2023.
​
In addition to our funded backlog, we also had unfunded backlog of $358.1 million and $143.2 million as of April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Unfunded backlog does not meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC Topic 606. We define unfunded backlog as the total remaining potential order amounts under cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts with (i) multiple one-year options and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) contracts, or (ii) incremental funding. Unfunded backlog does not obligate the customer to purchase goods or services. There can be no assurance that unfunded backlog will result in any orders in any particular period, if at all. Management believes that unfunded backlog does not provide a reliable measure of future estimated revenue under our contracts. Unfunded backlog does not include the remaining potential value associated with a U.S. Army IDIQ-type contract for small UAS because values for each of the other domains within the contract have not been disclosed by the customer, and we cannot be certain that we will secure all task orders issued against the contract. Additionally, unfunded backlog on the SOCOM MEUAS contract reflects only those sites which have been awarded to Arcturus UAV, Inc. (“Arcturus”) and does not include the remaining potential value associated with the entire SOCOM MEUAV III/IV contract.
​
Because of possible future changes in delivery schedules and/or cancellations of orders, backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales to be expected for any succeeding period, and actual sales for the year may not meet or exceed the backlog represented. Our backlog is typically subject to large variations from quarter to quarter as existing contracts expire or are renewed or new contracts are awarded. A majority of our contracts, specifically our IDIQ contracts, do not currently obligate the U.S. government to purchase any goods or services. Additionally, all U.S. government contracts included in backlog, whether or not they are funded, may be terminated at the convenience of the U.S. government.

​
Our Business
​
Our business addresses the increasing value of intelligent, multi-domain robotic systems providing distributed, network-centric intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (“ISR”), communications, remote sensing, effects delivery and remote materials handling with innovative UAS, TMS and UGV solutions. With respect to the defense applications for these technologies, nearly 20 years of counterinsurgency operations in regions where U.S. and allied forces benefit from air and technical superiority have driven the demand for a variety of unmanned systems in the air and on the ground. The recent shift of U.S. and allied defense planning toward countering peer and near-peer adversaries requires a portfolio of capabilities that can operate effectively in areas where the battlespace, including the air, radio frequency 

10



spectrum and Global Positioning Satellite (“GPS”) signals, may be contested, driving the need for more intelligent robotic systems capable of autonomous operation.
​
Industry Background
​
Small UAS and MUAS
​
The defense market for small UAS and MUAS has grown significantly since the early 2000s, driven largely by the demands associated with the global threat environment and resulting procurement by military customers, the early adopters for this technology. Small UAS and MUAS now represent accepted and enduring capabilities for military forces around the world. The U.S. military’s transformation into a smaller, more agile force that operates via a network of observation, communication and precision targeting technologies accelerated following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, as it required improved, distributed observation and targeting of enemy combatants who operate in small groups, often embedded in dense population centers or dispersed in remote locations, to operate effectively in a counterinsurgency threat environment. We believe that UAS, which range from large systems, such as Northrop Grumman’s Global Hawk and General Atomics’ Predator, Sky Warrior, Reaper and Gray Eagle, to medium systems such as our Puma LE, T-20 and JUMP 20, Boeing’s ScanEagle and Integrator and Textron’s Shadow, to small systems, such as our Raven, Wasp AE, Puma AE, and VAPOR, serve as integral components of today’s military force. These systems provide critical observation and communications capabilities serving the increasing demand for actionable intelligence, while reducing risk to individual “warfighters.” Small UAS and MUAS can provide real-time observation and communication capabilities to commanders and directly to the small units who control them. As airspace regulations in the U.S. and other nations evolve to accommodate the commercial use of small UAS, significant growth in the number of entities developing small UAS solutions is taking place.
​
Tactical Missile Systems
​
The development of weapons capable of rapid deployment and precision strike that also minimize the risk to surrounding civilians, property and operators has accelerated due to advances in enabling technologies. Weapons such as laser-guided missiles, “smart” bombs and GPS-guided artillery shells have dramatically improved the accuracy of strikes against hostile targets. When ground forces find themselves engaged in a firefight or near a hostile target, their ability to employ a precision weapon system quickly and easily can mean the difference between mission success and failure. A rapidly deployable solution could address emerging requirements beyond ground engagements for use in other types of missions and from a variety of sea, air and land platforms. We believe that embedding a precision lethal payload into a remotely controlled, portable delivery system provides warfighters with a valuable and more cost-effective alternative to existing munition and missile systems.
​
Unmanned Ground Vehicles
​
In situations where improvised explosive devices, caustic chemicals, nuclear, radiological or biological hazards or violent individuals represent significant danger to humans, UGVs can help responders remove, contain or neutralize these hazards without putting people in harm’s way. We believe that as enabling technologies continue to advance, UGVs will become more autonomous, more capable and more effective in dealing with hazardous threats, expanding the market potential for this set of applications to include non-defense applications such as facility security, infrastructure inspection, delivery of goods and many others.
​
High-Altitude Pseudo-Satellite (“HAPS”) UAS
​
We believe a market opportunity exists for HAPS UAS that can fly for months at a time to provide continuous remote sensing and communications in an affordable manner over great distances. Existing solutions such as terrestrial cellular towers, communications satellites and manned and unmanned aircraft address some of the emerging demand for this capability but do so at relatively high financial and resource costs. Next generation mobile telephony, referred to as 5G, can use higher frequencies than those currently employed by existing 4G and LTE networks. These higher frequencies are not capable of traveling long distances as compared to the frequencies associated with existing networks. As a result, 5G deployment requires the installation of a large number of base stations and cellular towers to complement 

11



existing infrastructure, resulting in a significant investment of time, resources and capital. Geosynchronous satellites provide fixed, continuous communications capabilities to large portions of the globe, but because they operate more than 20,000 miles from the surface of the earth, the bandwidth they can provide is limited, introducing latency in communications signals and requiring relatively larger, higher power ground stations. Remote sensing satellites typically operate at lower altitudes, but are unable to maintain geosynchronous positions, meaning they are moving with respect to the surface of the earth, resulting in a limited presence over specific areas of interest and significant periods of time during which they are not present over those areas. A new category of constellations consisting of a large number of very small and low earth orbiting satellites is proposed to provide a lower cost alternative with more ubiquitous coverage for reconnaissance and communication but is only beginning to be deployed in meaningful quantities and may not be capable of providing the uninterrupted service and quality required by commercial mobile carriers. All satellites require special ground based receiving hardware that may further limit their telecommunication applications. High-altitude balloons carrying communication payloads are subject to wind direction and speed and, therefore, may not be able to deliver the continuous, uninterrupted service and connection quality required by commercial mobile carriers but may be suitable for other applications. UAS that are capable of operating in an affordable manner for extended periods of time over an area of interest while communicating directly with available handheld mobile devices without gaps in availability and carrying a communications or observation payload could help to satisfy this need.
​
Advanced Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy
​
Robotic systems designed to operate in complex environments, such as contested battlespaces or urban locations, will require advanced artificial intelligence capabilities to enable non-GPS navigation and higher levels of autonomy. For defense applications, this could require other navigation methods to ensure location accuracy and incorporating computer vision capabilities to respond to changes on the ground or in the air. Such higher levels of autonomy will become increasingly more valuable in enabling the effective use of robotic systems.

​
Small UAS Products
​
Our small UAS, including Raven, Wasp AE, Puma AE, Puma LE, and VAPOR are designed to operate reliably at very low altitudes in a wide range of environmental conditions, providing a vantage point from which to collect and deliver valuable information. Military forces employ our small UAS to deliver ISR and communications, including real-time tactical reconnaissance, tracking, combat assessment and geographic data, directly to the small tactical unit or individual operator, thereby increasing flexibility in mission planning and execution. Our small UAS wirelessly transmit critical live video and other information generated by their payload of electro-optical, infrared or other sensors directly to a hand-held ground control unit, enabling the operator to view and capture images, during the day or at night, on the control unit. Our ground control systems allow the operator to control the aircraft by programming it for GPS-based autonomous navigation using operator-designated way-points, or by manual flight operation. The ground control systems are designed for durability and ease of use in harsh environments and incorporate a user-friendly, intuitive user interface. All of our fixed wing small UAS currently in production for military customers operate from our Crysalis common ground control system. Our VAPOR helicopter UAS currently employs a distinct portable ground control system.
​
We designed our small UAS to be transportable by a single person, assembled in minutes and launched and operated by one or two people, with limited training required. The efficient and reliable electric motors used in all of our small UAS are powered by modular battery packs that can be replaced quickly, enabling rapid return to flight. We designed all of our small UAS to be reusable for hundreds of flights under normal operating circumstances and to be recovered through an autonomous landing feature that enables a controlled descent to a designated location.
​
In military applications, our small UAS provide forward aerial observation capabilities that enable tactical commanders to observe, for example, around the next corner, to the next intersection or past a ridgeline in real-time.

This information facilitates faster, safer movement through urban, rural, riverine and mountainous environments and can enable troops to be proactive based on field intelligence rather than reactive to attack. Moreover, by providing this information, our systems reduce the risk to warfighters and to the surrounding population by providing the ability to tailor the military response to the threat. U.S. military personnel regularly use our small UAS, such as Raven, for missions such as force protection, combat observation and damage assessment. These reusable systems are easy to transport, assemble and operate and are relatively quiet when flying at typical altitudes of 300 to 500 feet above ground level, as a result of our efficient electric propulsion systems. Furthermore, their small size makes them difficult to see from the ground. In addition, the low cost of our small UAS relative to larger systems and alternatives makes it practical for customers to deploy these assets in large quantities, directly to warfighters.
​
In emerging commercial applications, our small UAS enable enterprises to manage valuable assets such as crops, powerlines and railroad infrastructure, more effectively and safely than previously possible. Our VAPOR helicopter systems are designed to provide more accurate and timely information to individuals or organizations for more informed decision-making. Better and more timely information can translate into more efficient activities that facilitate more efficient use of resources such as maintenance operations.
​
Our small UAS offering also includes spare equipment, alternative payload modules, batteries, chargers, repair services and customer support. We provide training by our highly-skilled instructors, who typically possess extensive military experience, and continuous refurbishment and repair services for our products. By maintaining close contact with our customers and users in the field, we gather critical feedback on our products and incorporate that information into ongoing product development and research and development efforts. This approach enables us to improve our solutions in response to, and in anticipation of, evolving customer needs.
​
Certain systems within our small UAS portfolio include multiple aircraft, our common and interoperable hand-held Crysalis ground control system and an array of spare parts and accessories. Other systems, namely, Puma LE, and VAPOR, consist of a single air vehicle, as well as a ground control system, spare parts and accessories. Our current small UAS portfolio for defense applications consists of the following aircraft:

​
The ground control system serves as the primary interface between the operator and our small UAS and allows the operator of each system to control the direction, speed and altitude of the aircraft as well as the orientation of the sensors to view the visual information they produce through real-time, streaming video and metadata. Our common ground control system interfaces with each of our fixed wing air vehicles, providing a common user experience. In addition to the thousands of air vehicles delivered to our customers, thousands of ground control systems are also in our customers’ hands.
​
Our line of miniature gimbaled sensor payloads provides small UAS operators with enhanced observation and target tracking functionality. Our DDL is integrated into Puma LE, Puma AE, Raven and Wasp AE systems, enhancing their capabilities, and ultimately, the utility of our small UAS by enabling more efficient radio spectrum utilization and communications security. Small UAS incorporating our DDL are optimized for the low-power, low-latency, and streaming bandwidth efficiency required for UAS. Additionally, our DDL enables each air vehicle to operate as an Internet-Protocol addressable hub capable of routing and relaying video, voice and data to and from multiple other nodes 

13



on this ad hoc network. This capability enables beyond line-of-sight operation of our small UAS, further enhancing their value proposition to our customers.
​
MUAS Products
​
Providing similar capabilities to our small UAS, our field-deployable MUAS, including T-20 and JUMP 20, deliver extended endurance and expanded payload capacity to support a broader set of missions that benefit from aerial surveillance and the use of specialized payloads. The internal combustion-powered T-20 and JUMP 20 offer significantly greater endurance and payload capacity than our small UAS, with larger airframes that can also accommodate a wider variety of payloads. The JUMP 20 launches and lands vertically as a result of its vertical take-off and landing (“VTOL”) rotors, minimizing the amount of space required for its operation. The T-20 launches from a catapult, lands on a short runway and provides more than 24 hours of endurance.
​
T-20 and JUMP 20 operate from their own portable common ground control system.

Tactical Missile Systems Products
​
Our TMS consist of tube-launched aircraft that deploy with the push of a button, fly at higher speeds than our small UAS, and perform either effects delivery or reconnaissance missions. Switchblade 300, the first of our TMS products, can be transported in its launch tube, within a backpack, and deployed within minutes to defend against lethal threats such as snipers and mortar launchers. With a high level of precision, including a customized warhead, patented wave-off, loiter and re-engagement capabilities, Switchblade 300 can neutralize a target rapidly and accurately without causing collateral damage. Furthermore, because it streams live electro-optical and thermal video to its operator, Switchblade 300 can be called off in the final moments prior to a strike should the situation require, potentially eliminating damage to non-combatants. Switchblade 600 is a larger version of Switchblade 300 that can fly for a longer period of time and over a longer distance while carrying a larger, more powerful, anti-armor warhead. Blackwing, a variant of Switchblade 300, launches from a submerged submarine and carries extra batteries instead of a warhead, providing longer flight time for extended maritime reconnaissance operations.

ISR Services
​
We currently operate our MUAS, such as JUMP 20, in overseas locations to support U.S. military operations under ISR services contracts. Under these services contracts we deliver the information our MUAS produce to our customers, who use that information to support their missions. These contracts specify a location and number of hours per month of services to perform. This contractor-owned, contractor-operated (“COCO”) arrangement represents a new 

14



business model for the company as a result of the acquisition of Arcturus and provides access to alternative customer funding sources, while also providing a way for customers who may not wish to own and operate their UAS to benefit from their differentiated capabilities. This COCO business model may expand to include other AeroVironment solutions in the future.
​
Unmanned Ground Vehicle Products
​
Our UGV support a variety of missions and applications, ranging from explosive ordnance disposal to hazardous materials handling and law enforcement operations. All of our UGVs feature secure communications, multi-axis manipulators and automatic tool exchange, which eliminates the need for the UGV to return to its operator to switch the tool attached to its manipulator arm. We also offer fully equipped service vehicles for the transport, service and operation of our UGV solutions. All of our UGVs feature the intuitive and operationally simplified Robo Command Ground control stations with multi-touch screen, pre-programmed motion sequences and ergonomically designed hand controllers for precision control of the robot, manipulator and accessories.

​
Two of our UAS and TMS development initiatives are described below:
​
Tactical Missile System Variants. We pioneered our first rapidly deployable, high-precision TMS, named Switchblade, for use by defense ground forces. Switchblade 300 is now deployed by the U.S. military to provide force protection to its troops overseas in combat operations. During numerous demonstrations over the course of several years, multiple potential customers requested modifications to Switchblade 300 to accommodate their specific mission requirements. We performed a number of successful demonstrations and are now developing several variants of Switchblade 300 for new customers and applications, including deployment from sea and air vehicles. Blackwing, a submarine-launched reconnaissance system, represents one of the variants that has now generated meaningful procurement demand. Another variant, Switchblade 600, is a larger version that delivers longer endurance, greater range, a larger payload and more significant mission effects. We believe these new variants have the potential to expand our TMS opportunities significantly.
​
HAPS Unmanned Aircraft Systems. Building on our decades of groundbreaking development and demonstration of high altitude solar-powered UAS, in fiscal year 2018 we established a joint venture, HAPSMobile, Inc (“HAPSMobile”). with SoftBank to create a global broadband and telecommunications company to demonstrate and deploy HAPS UAS around the world. In October 2020, we completed a fifth successful test flight of the HAPS UAS, which included a broadband mobile communication demonstration on consumer smart phones from the stratosphere. As part of a restructuring of the HAPS development program in May 2021, we and SoftBank entered into a Master Design and Development Agreement (“MDDA”) to continue the development of HAPS UAS and agreed to cooperate with each other to explore restructuring and financing options for HAPSMobile. In furtherance of this restructuring, we sold our 7% share of HAPSMobile to SoftBank, which already owned a majority 93% share of the joint venture, on March 18, 2022. Despite the sale of shares in HAPSMobile, the HAPS UAV development relationship continues with SoftBank now directly funding the development and demonstration of solar-powered HAPS UAS. During the term of the MDDA, AeroVironment possesses exclusive rights from SoftBank for future design and manufacturing work for the Solar HAPS UAS and future variants thereof, subject to meeting contractual performance criteria.
​
Sales and Marketing
​
Our Product Line Management organization translates customer and market requirements into multi-year product roadmaps that guide our development, engineering and manufacturing plans. We organize our U.S. business development team members by target market and customer, and we locate team members in close proximity to the customers they support when possible. We organize our program managers by product and focus on designing optimal solutions and contract fulfillment, as well as internalizing feedback from customers and users. By maintaining assigned points of contact with our customers, we believe that we are able to maintain our relationships, service existing contracts effectively and gain vital feedback to improve our responsiveness and product offerings.
​
Manufacturing and Operations
​
Continued investment in infrastructure has established our manufacturing capability to meet demand with scalable capacity. We have the manufacturing infrastructure to produce products at rates higher than our historical volumes, support initial low rate production for new UAS development programs and TMS and execute initial low-rate production of large UAS. By drawing upon experienced personnel across various manufacturing industries including aerospace, automotive and volume commodities, we have instituted lean production systems and leverage our International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) certification for Quality Management, integrated supply chain strategy, document control systems and process control methodologies for production. Presently, we perform small UAS 

17



manufacturing at the 85,000 square foot manufacturing facility we established in 2005. Our ISO 9001:2015 + AS9100D certified manufacturing facilities are designed to accommodate demand of up to 1,000 aircraft per month. ISO 9001:2015 + AS9100D refers to a set of voluntary standards for quality management systems. The 9001:2015 standards are established by the ISO to govern quality management systems used worldwide. We are regularly audited and certified to be compliant by a third party, accredited registrar. Accreditation of SAI Global, our third party registrar, is by the ANSI National Accreditation Board. These audits performed as part of certification evaluate the effectiveness of companies’ quality management systems and their compliance with ISO standards. Some companies and government agencies view ISO certification as a positive factor in supplier assessments.
​
Competition
​
The defense market for small UAS continues to evolve in response to changing technologies, shifting customer needs and expectations and the potential introduction of new products. We believe that a number of established domestic and international defense contractors have developed or are developing small UAS that continue to compete, or will compete, directly with our products. Some of these contractors have significantly greater financial and other resources than we possess. Our current principal small UAS competitors include Elbit Systems Ltd., Teledyne Technologies, Inc., L3 Technologies, Inc., and Lockheed Martin Corporation. We do not view large UAS such as Northrop Grumman Corporation’s Global Hawk or General Atomics, Inc.’s Predator and its derivatives as direct competitors to our small UAS because they perform different missions, do not typically deliver their information directly to front-line ground forces and are not hand-launched and controlled. However, we cannot be certain that these platforms will not become direct competitors in the future. Potential competition from consumer and commercially focused drone manufacturers is emerging as their capabilities increase and their prices remain low relative to existing defense solutions, which is resulting in some level of military consideration even if such drones do not meet traditional military performance or security specifications. Such potential competitors include Skydio, Inc. and Shield AI.
​
The U.S. defense market for MUAS has been addressed primarily by The Boeing Company’s ScanEagle and Textron Inc.’s Shadow UAS. Our current principal MUAS competitors include those competing with us for the U.S. Army’s Future Tactical UAS (FTUAS) program: Martin UAV and Northrop Grumman’s V-Bat, Textron’s Aerosonde and L3Harris’ FVR-90. International MUAS competitors include Elbit Systems Ltd. and Israeli Aircraft Industries. We do not view large UAS such as Northrop Grumman Corporation’s Global Hawk or General Atomics, Inc.’s Predator and its derivatives as direct competitors to our MUAS because they perform different missions, require a larger logistical footprint and cost considerably more to procure and operate. However, we cannot be certain that these platforms will not become direct competitors in the future as we expand the capabilities of our MUAS products to, potentially, impinge upon the lower end of the large UAS market segment.
​
The market for TMS is in an early stage of development, but it is evolving rapidly. Competitors in this market include Textron Inc., Raytheon Technologies, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Anduril Industries and UVision Air Ltd.
​
The market for UGV spans the global defense, first responder, security and logistics market segments. The UGV opportunity in the U.S. DoD has grown with recent U.S. Army procurement awards and a pending U.S. Air Force program. Competitors in the U.S. UGV market include L3Harris Technologies, Inc., Teledyne Technologies, Inc., QinetiQ North America, Inc., Peraton/Remotec, ICOR and Boston Dynamics. Initial adoption of UGVs for law enforcement and other government agencies is also progressing in the U.S. and globally, as well as applications in hazardous materials handling.
​
The market for HAPS UAS is in an early stage of development. As a result, this category is not well defined and is characterized by multiple potential solutions. An existing contractor that claims to provide high altitude long endurance UAS is Northrop Grumman Corporation with its Global Hawk. Several aerospace and defense contractors have pursued this market opportunity with proposed very long duration UAS, including The Boeing Company, Airbus, Lockheed Martin Corporation and Northrop Grumman Corporation. Companies pursuing airships (high altitude aircraft that are kept buoyant by a body of gas that is lighter than air) as a solution for this market include Lockheed Martin Corporation and Northrop Grumman Corporation. A number of telecommunications, aerospace and technology companies, including the company and its former joint venture partner HAPSMobile launched the HAPS Alliance to promote the benefits of HAPS to the global population. Companies pursuing conventional satellites as a solution for this 

18



market include The Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation, General Dynamics Corporation, EADS N.V., Ball Corporation and Northrop Grumman Corporation. Companies pursuing Low Earth Orbit (“LEO”), micro or cubesat satellite constellations for global communication and remote sensing include Amazon, Planet, OneWeb, SpaceX and The Boeing Company. Companies owning and operating terrestrial cellular tower networks include American Tower Corporation, Crown Castle International Corp. and SBA Communications Corporation.
​
The market for commercial UAS products and services is in an early stage of development, but is evolving rapidly, generating a great deal of interest as government regulations evolve to accommodate commercial UAS operations in the National Airspace System and in the airspace systems of other countries. Given the breadth of applications and the diversity of industries that could benefit from UAS technology, a growing number of potential competitors in this market include consumer drone manufacturers such as Dà-Jiāng Innovation, who seek to enhance their systems’ capabilities over time; other small UAS manufacturers, including large aerospace companies such as Lockheed Martin Corporation, and drone and aerial surveying and mapping service providers such as PrecisionHawk, Sentera and SlantRange; ground-based surveying and mapping service providers; satellite imagery providers; and specialty system manufacturers, software as a service and other service providers aiming to address specific market segments. The emerging non-military market is attracting numerous additional competitors and significant venture capital funding given perceived lower barriers to entry and a much more fragmented marketplace as compared to the military market. Potential additional competitors include start-up companies providing low cost solutions.
​
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets for our UAS, TMS and UGV products and services include product performance; safety; features; acquisition cost; lifetime operating cost, including maintenance and support; ease of use; integration with existing equipment and processes; quality; reliability; customer support, brand and reputation.
​
Regulation
​
Due to the fact that we contract with the DoD and other agencies of the U.S. government, we are subject to extensive federal regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisitions Regulations, Truth in Negotiations Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, False Claims Act and the regulations promulgated under the DoD Industrial Security Manual, which establishes the security guidelines for classified programs and facilities as well as individual security clearances. The federal government audits and reviews our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. Like most government contractors, our contracts are audited and reviewed on a continual basis by federal agencies, including the Defense Contract Management Agency (“DCMA”) and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (“DCAA”).
​
Certain of these regulations impose substantial penalties for violations, including suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. We monitor all of our contracts and contractual efforts to minimize the possibility of any violation of these regulations.
​
In addition, we are subject to industry-specific regulations due to the nature of the products and services we provide. For example, certain aspects of our business are subject to further regulation by additional U.S. government authorities, including (i) the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), which regulates airspace for all air vehicles in the U.S. National Airspace System, (ii) the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Federal Communications Commission, which regulate the wireless communications upon which our UAS depend in the United States and (iii) the Defense Trade Controls of the U.S. Department of State that administers the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which regulate the export of controlled technical data, defense articles and defense services.
​
On June 21, 2016, the FAA released its final rules that allow routine use of certain small UAS in the U.S. National Airspace System. The FAA rules, which went into effect in August 2016, provide safety rules for small UAS (under 55 pounds) conducting non-recreational operations. The rules limit flights to visual-line-of-sight daylight operation, unless the UAS has anti-collision lights in which case twilight operation is permitted. The final rule also addresses height and speed restrictions, operator certification, optional use of a visual observer, aircraft registration and marking and operational limits, including prohibiting flights over unprotected people on the ground who are not directly 

19



participating in the operation of the UAS. Current FAA regulations require drone operators to register their systems with the FAA and secure operating licenses for their drones as per the Part 107 specifications. These regulations continue to evolve to accommodate the integration of UAS into the national airspace system for commercial applications, including HAPS UAS.
​
In December 2019, the FAA proposed rules requiring the remote identification of UAS. Remote identification, which provides for a UAS in flight to provide identification that can be received by other parties, is designed to enhance safety and security by allowing the FAA and other agencies to identify a UAS that appears to be flying unsafely or in an area in which flight is not permitted. The public comment period for the proposed rules expired on March 2, 2020. On April 21, 2021, the final rule for remote identification of UAS went into effect. On the same day, the final rule for operation of small UAS over people also went into effect. This rule permits routine operations of small unmanned aircraft over people, moving vehicles, and at night under certain conditions. The final rule also makes changes to the recurrent testing framework and expands the list of persons who may request the presentation of a remote pilot certificate. Additionally, in February 2020, the FAA issued a public request for comment on its proposed policy for the creation of a new type certification of certain UAS as a special class of aircraft under FAA regulations. Currently the Part 107 Rules (as defined below) allow for the operation of small UAS without the need for FAA airworthiness certification as long as the UAS meets certain specified criteria and certain flight rules are followed; larger UAS and operations of small UAS outside the scope of the Part 107 Rules (as defined below) require a waiver from the FAA. The FAA’s proposed policy proposes a new special class of UAS for which airworthiness certification can be obtained, however, the proposed policy only applies to the procedures for the type certification of the new class of UAS, not the criteria that will be needed for the UAS or the flight operations to be followed to operate. Further rulemaking by the FAA is anticipated regarding the particular criteria for the airworthiness certification standards under the new special class proposed by the new policy. The comment period for the FAA’s proposed policy expired on March 4, 2020.
​
While it is currently anticipated that the enactment of remote identification, operation of small UAS over people, and a new airworthiness certification process for a newly created special class of UAS will help formalize the process for manufacturing and obtaining airworthiness certification for UAS within the newly created class and accelerate the development of commercial UAS in the U.S., it is uncertain whether the FAA’s actions, if any, will have such effects. It is also unclear when, if at all, the FAA will create a new class of UAS and what the final rules regarding the certification of such UAS will look like. We cannot be certain as to how our business will be affected by the FAA’s proposals until the final rules for such matters are issued by the FAA.
​
Furthermore, our non-U.S. operations are subject to the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions, which may include regulations that are more stringent than those imposed by the U.S. government on our U.S. operations.

We sell the significant majority of our small UAS, MUAS and TMS products and services under contracts with the U.S. government. Certain important aspects of our U.S. government contracts are described below.
​
Bidding Process
​
Most of our current U.S. government contracts were awarded through a competitive bidding process. The U.S. government awards competitive-bid contracts based on proposal evaluation criteria established by the procuring agency. Competitive-bid contracts are awarded after a formal bid and proposal competition among providers. Interested contractors prepare a bid and proposal in response to the agency’s request for proposal or request for information. A bid and proposal is usually prepared in a short time period in response to a deadline and requires the extensive involvement of numerous technical and administrative personnel. Following award, competitive-bid contracts may be challenged by unsuccessful bidders.
​
Funding
​
The funding of U.S. government programs is subject to congressional appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal 

20



year basis, even though a program may continue for many years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially, and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations.
​
The U.S. military funds its contracts for our full-rate production UAS either through operational need statements or as programs of record. Operational need statements require allocations of discretionary spending or reallocations of funding from other government programs. Funding for our production of initial Raven system deliveries, for example, was provided through operational need statements. We define a program of record as a program which, after undergoing extensive DoD review and product testing, is included in the five-year government budget cycle, meaning that funding is allocated for purchases under these contracts during the five-year cycle, absent affirmative action by the customer or Congress to change the budgeted amount. Despite being included in the five-year budget cycle, funding for these programs is subject to annual approval.
​
Material U.S. Government Contract Provisions
​
All contracts with the U.S. government contain provisions, and are subject to laws and regulations, that give the government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts, including rights that allow the U.S. government to:
​

● | terminate existing contracts for convenience, in whole or in part, when it is in the interest of the government to do so;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | terminate contracts for default upon the occurrence of certain enumerated events;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | unilaterally modify contracts with regard to certain performance requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | cancel multi-year contracts and related orders, if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | potentially obtain rights in, or ownership to, intellectual property associated with products and systems developed or delivered by a contractor as a result of its performance of the contract;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | adjust contract costs and fees on the basis of audits completed by its agencies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | suspend or debar a contractor from doing business with the U.S. government; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | control or prohibit the export of certain items.
--+-------------------------------------------------

​
Generally, government contracts are subject to oversight audits by government representatives. Compensation, if any, in the event of a termination for default is limited to payment for work completed at the time of termination. In the event of a termination for convenience, the contractor may receive the contract price for completed work, as well as its costs of performance of terminated work including an allowance for profit and reasonable termination settlement costs.
​
U.S. Government Contract Categories
​
There are three primary types of government contracts in our industry, each of which involves a different payment methodology and level of risk related to the cost of performance. These basic types of contracts are typically referred to as fixed-price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, including cost-plus-fixed fee, cost-plus-award fee, and cost-plus-incentive fee, and time-and-materials contracts.
​
In some cases, depending on the urgency of the project and the complexity of the contract negotiation, we will enter into a Letter Contract prior to finalizing the terms of a definitive fixed-price, cost reimbursable or time-and-materials definitive contract. A Letter Contract is a written preliminary contractual instrument that provides 

21



limited initial funding and authorizes us to begin immediately manufacturing supplies or performing services while negotiating the definitive terms of the procurement.
​
Fixed-Price. These contracts are not subject to adjustment by reason of costs incurred in the performance of the contract. With this type of contract, we assume the risk that we will not be able to perform at a cost below the fixed-price, except for costs incurred because of contract changes ordered by the customer. Upon the U.S. government’s termination of a fixed-price contract, generally we would be entitled to payment for items delivered to and accepted by the U.S. government and, if the termination is at the U.S. government’s convenience, for payment of fair compensation for work performed plus the costs of settling and paying claims by any terminated subcontractors, other settlement expenses and a reasonable allowance for profit on the costs incurred.
​
Cost Reimbursable. Cost reimbursable contracts include cost-plus-fixed fee contracts, cost-plus-award fee contracts and cost-plus-incentive fee contracts, each of which are described below. Under each type of contract, we assume the risk that we may not be able to recover costs if they are not allowable under the contract terms or applicable regulations, or if the costs exceed the contract funding.
​

● | Cost-plus-fixed fee contracts are cost reimbursable contracts that provide for payment of a negotiated fee that is fixed at the inception of the contract. This fixed fee does not vary with actual cost of the contract but may be adjusted as a result of changes in the work to be performed under the contract. This contract type poses less risk of loss than a fixed-price contract, but our ability to win future contracts from the procuring agency may be adversely affected if we fail to perform within the maximum cost set forth in the contract.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | A cost-plus-award fee contract is a cost reimbursable contract that provides for a fee consisting of a base amount, which may be zero, fixed at inception of the contract and an award amount, based upon the government’s satisfaction with the performance under the contract. With this type of contract, we assume the risk that we may not receive the award fee, or only a portion of it, if we do not perform satisfactorily.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | A cost-plus-incentive fee contract is a cost reimbursable contract that provides for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We typically experience lower profit margins and lower risk under cost reimbursable contracts than under fixed-price contracts. Upon the termination of a cost reimbursable contract, generally we would be entitled to reimbursement of our allowable costs and, if the termination is at the U.S. government’s convenience, a total fee proportionate to the percentage of work completed under the contract.
​
Time-and-Materials. Under a time-and-materials contract, our compensation is based on a fixed hourly rate established for specified labor or skill categories. We are paid at the established hourly rates for the hours we expend performing the work specified in the contract. Labor costs, overhead, general and administrative costs and profit are included in the fixed hourly rate. Materials, subcontractors, travel and other direct costs are reimbursed at actual costs plus an amount for material handling. We make critical pricing assumptions and decisions when developing and proposing time-and-materials labor rates. We risk reduced profitability if our actual costs exceed the costs incorporated into the fixed hourly labor rate. One variation of a standard time-and-materials contract is a time-and-materials, award fee contract. Under this type of contract, a positive or negative incentive can be earned based on achievement against specific performance metrics.

Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract Form
​
The U.S. government frequently uses IDIQ contracts and IDIQ-type contract forms, such as cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts with multiple one-year options, to obtain fixed-price, cost reimbursable and time-and-materials contractual commitments to provide products or services over a period of time pursuant to established general terms and conditions. At the time of the award of an IDIQ contract or IDIQ-type contract, the U.S. government generally commits to purchase only a minimal amount of products or services from the contractor to whom such contract is awarded.
​
After award of an IDIQ contract the U.S. government may issue task or delivery orders for specific services or products it needs. The competitive process to obtain task orders under an award contract is limited to the pre-selected contractors. If an IDIQ contract has a single prime contractor, then the award of task orders is limited to that contractor. If the contract has multiple prime contractors, then the award of the task order is competitively determined among only those prime contractors.
​
IDIQ and IDIQ-type contracts typically have multi-year terms and unfunded ceiling amounts that enable, but do not commit, the U.S. government to purchase substantial amounts of products and services from one or more contractors.
​
International Contracting Process
​
We supply our UAS, TMS, and UGV products and services to international allied governments.. Certain important aspects of our international contracts are described below. Each international customer has its own laws, regulations, bureaucracy and forms of procurement agreements that present challenges in our international contracting process.
Bidding Process
​
Our international contracts generally result from a competitive bidding process, and to a lesser extent, sole source awards for urgent requirements or sustainment and typically begin with the receipt of a request for proposal, information or quotation from an international government procurement agency. Numerous of our technical and administrative personnel are involved in responding to such request.
​
Competitive bid contracts are awarded after a formal bid and proposal competition among providers. Interested contractors prepare a bid and proposal in response to a procurement agency’s request for proposal or request for information, which proposals are then reviewed by the applicable procurement agency based on the established evaluation criteria for the proposal. Following award, competitive bid contracts may be challenged by unsuccessful bidders. International competitive bidding processes are highly competitive and sometimes we face disadvantages in the bidding and evaluation process in comparison to local, domestic bidders that may receive priority or more favorable evaluations than non-domestic suppliers due to stated requirements in the local regulations that promote domestic procurements.
​
Sole source awards are direct engagements with the procuring agency. Contractors receive requests for proposal or quotation and respond to such request. If accepted by the customer, the resulting contract is for a defined quantity of goods or services for a specific time period. Generally sole source awards are utilized by our existing customers to sustain or augment their fleets of our products, commonly through multi-year support agreements. These agreements allow for customer logistics organizations to tailor procurement and support efforts to the needs of the end users.
​
Funding
​
International customers have individualized funding processes that are generally allocated during the applicable country’s fiscal year. Funding may be broadly allocated to a governmental agency or military branch responsible for procurement, targeted for a specific purpose like unmanned systems, or earmarked to a specific requirement for our products. Funding allocations are typically confidential, making it challenging for us to forecast demand for our products or whether funding is available. Additionally, funding may be reallocated when higher needs arise, such as what occurred in many countries during the COVID-19 pandemic when such countries shifted defense funding to measures to address the pandemic. Forecasted requirements are then delayed until the next fiscal year or cancelled.

23



​
Competitive bidding opportunities for our products and services typically have budgets and timelines which require significant investment from the customer. Initial procurement or replacement programs for our products and services may not be considered necessities for some international customers, which makes such procurements susceptible to a reduction in available funding or a complete reallocation of funds to other government programs or initiatives. When funds are reduced, it is common for the reduced funds to be utilized to support the sustainment of the customer’s existing fleet of UAS, rather than for new procurements.
​
Many of our international customers have established fleets of our UAS, which generally allows them to seek and obtain budget for yearly incremental allocations of funding. These allocations are contracted through existing multi-year support agreements which provide the customer flexibility to procure products and services when funding is available.
​
Contract Types and Provisions
​
Our typical international customer contracts taken the form of fixed price contracts and time and materials contracts. Most of our international contracts are fixed-price contracts as their finite nature is desired by customers. Time-and-materials contracts are more common for our service work with a defined limit on funding and period of performance.
​
With a wide range of international customers, it is common for our customer contracts to contain customer advantageous provisions which are governed by applicable local laws and regulations that may differ from industry standard provisions and contracting norms in the United States. The contractual provisions may, among other things, result in more difficulties enforcing such agreements and collecting receivables and provide us with fewer remedies in a contractual dispute and lesser protections for our intellectual property. We assess the unique risks for each contract on a contract-by-contract basis. We use and require banking guarantees and/or advance payments to minimize risk.
