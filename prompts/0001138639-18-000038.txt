ITEM 1.        BUSINESS
Infinera Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our” or “Infinera”) is a leader in optical transport networking solutions, providing equipment, software and services to telecommunications service providers, internet content providers (“ICPs”), cable providers, wholesale and enterprise carriers, research and education institutions, enterprise customers, and government entities across the globe. Optical transport networks are deployed by customers facing significant demand for optical bandwidth prompted by increased use of high-speed internet access, business Ethernet services, mobile broadband, cloud-based services, high-definition video streaming services, virtual and augmented reality, and the Internet of Things (IoT).
Our optical transport systems are highly scalable, flexible and open, built using a combination of internally manufactured and third-party components. Technologically, a key element of our systems are optical engines, which comprise large-scale photonic integrated circuits (“PICs”) and digital signal processors (“DSPs”). We optimize the manufacturing process by using indium phosphide to build our PICs, which enables the integration of a large amount of optical functions onto a set of semiconductor chips. This large-scale integration of our PICs and advanced DSPs allow us to deliver on the features that customers care about the most, including cost per bit, power and space. In addition, our optical engines are designed to increase the capacity and reach performance of our products by leveraging coherent optical transmission. 
Over the past few years, we have significantly increased the number of products we offer, evolving from focusing entirely on the long-haul and subsea markets to offering a more complete suite of solutions that span the long-haul, subsea, DCI and metro markets. In late 2014, we expanded our addressable market by introducing the Cloud Xpress platform for the DCI market to meet a growing need for metro-reach optical interconnections between data centers. We introduced the Cloud Xpress 2 in mid-2017, which further optimizes capacity, space and power, all key elements our ICP customers' value.
In the second half of 2015, we entered the metro market with the acquisition of Transmode AB (“Transmode”), a leader in metro packet-optical applications, based in Stockholm, Sweden. Entering into the metro market expanded our addressable market and enabled us to offer a more complete portfolio of solutions, particularly to existing long-haul customers that also build metro networks. We have expanded our suite of metro solutions by both enhancing our XTM Series platforms and also utilizing our optical engines to deliver Cloud Xpress, XT and XTC Series platforms.
In 2017, we began shipping two new platforms based on our new generation of technology. First, we introduced a series of new products powered by the Infinite Capacity Engine (ICE), a technology which delivers multi-terabit opto-electronic subsystems powered by our fourth-generation PIC and next-generation FlexCoherent DSP (the combination of which we refer to as “ICE4”). The Infinite Capacity Engine enables different subsystems that can be customized for a variety of network applications across our product portfolio, spanning the long-haul, subsea, datacenter interconnect (“DCI”) and metro markets. Second, we released our next-generation XTM Series platform, which leverages 16QAM modulation technology and is optimized for bandwidth-intensive applications at the metro edge. 
Our optical portfolio is designed to be managed by a single network management system. We also provide capabilities to enable programmability of our Intelligent Transport Networks with our technologies, such as Instant Bandwidth, which when combined with our differentiated hardware solutions, enable customers to turn on bandwidth as needed by activating a software license. Additionally, our Xceed Software Suite is a multi-layer management and control platform that simplifies customer operations and enables customers to leverage the scalability, flexibility and openness of our Intelligent Transport Networks to deliver services while efficiently using their network resources.
We believe our portfolio of solutions benefits our customers by providing a unique combination of highly scalable capacity and features that address various applications and ultimately simplify and automate optical network operations.
We were incorporated in December 2000 and originally operated under the name “Zepton Networks.” We are incorporated in the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 140 Caspian Court, Sunnyvale, CA 94089. Our telephone number is (408) 572-5200. “Infinera,” “Infinera DTN-X,” “FlexCoherent,” “Infinera FlexILS” and “Infinera Instant Bandwidth” are trademarks or service marks of Infinera Corporation in the United States, certain other countries and/or the European Union. Any other trademarks or trade names mentioned are the property of their respective owners.

Industry Background
Optical transport networking equipment carries digital information using light waves over fiber optic cables. With the advent of wavelength division multiplexing (“WDM”) systems, data is transmitted by using multiple wavelengths of light using different frequencies or colors over a single optical fiber. Customers deploy WDM systems to carry information between continents, across countries, between cities and within metropolitan areas, and in some cases all the way to the end-user. Fiber optic networks are generally capable of carrying most types of communications traffic. We believe that a number of trends in the communications industry are driving demand for large amounts of network bandwidth and ultimately will increase demand for optical transport networking systems. These trends include:

• | growth of cloud services;


• | growth of bandwidth-intensive services like streaming high-definition video services;


• | increasing use of connected virtual and augmented reality devices;


• | proliferation of mobile services of Wi-Fi, 4G and future growth of 5G; and


• | rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), driving massive growth in the number of network-connected devices.

As network traffic grows, customers add transmission bandwidth to existing optical networks or deploy new systems to address bandwidth demands and offer expanded services to end-users. In particular, consumers and businesses increasingly rely on the cloud for their application needs across compute, storage and network functions. As cloud adoption increases, large network operators are experiencing a magnification effect on incoming traffic, such that a single request from an end-user can generate many times the amount of traffic between data centers as compared to the amount of traffic generated by the original request. 
We believe we are in the midst of a shift in network architectures distinguished between addressing massive growth of server-to-server traffic between data centers and public internet user-to-data traffic as deployed by traditional service providers. To manage server-to-server traffic growth, our customers seek high capacity, scalable, disaggregated solutions designed to accommodate point-to-point traffic patterns. Infrastructure to address this demand is focused on minimizing power and space and being cost-optimized. In contrast, traditional service providers require high capacity solutions with more flexibility in their integrated network platforms to aggregate dataflows and add and drop traffic at various points across their networks. These customers require protection schemes and a larger variety of interfaces to address their end customer needs. Our solutions serve both the point-to-point applications driven by increasing data center traffic and the more traditional mesh-oriented switched transport networks. 
We believe our customers seek the following solutions to increase their revenue and/or expand their service offerings:

• | high-bandwidth solutions that scale optical transmission bandwidth to meet increasing demand while providing wide-ranging granularity for service efficiency;


• | efficient solutions with the right mix of disaggregated and integrated systems that optimize performance and increase reliability while reducing physical space and power consumption, leading to lower operational expenses;


• | easy-to-use solutions that are highly programmable and open, which help reduce the time and complexity of deploying new transmission bandwidth;


• | improved integration between packet or Internet Protocol equipment such as routers and optical transport networking equipment; and


• | strong encryption at the transport layer processed using hardware at line-rate speeds.

Strategy
Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of optical transport networking systems in the world. Key aspects of our strategy include:

• | Expanding business with existing customers and winning new customers. We have recently introduced multiple new products and expect to release additional products in 2018, which we believe will enable us to address a broader portion of the optical market, expand business with current customers and win new customers.


• | Accelerating the cadence at which new products are brought to market. Historically, we have brought to market new generations of our optical engine, which includes PICs and DSPs, approximately every five years. In response to the pace of architectural transitions and customer demand, we have accelerated our planned cadence of delivering new generations of ICE-based products in order to take full advantage of rapid growth in bandwidth requirements and market shifts. We intend to continually invest in key

2

technologies such as optical engines and software in order to enhance the performance, scalability and economic advantages of our products.

• | Aligning customer success with our success. When our customers are successful we are as well. For example, our Instant Bandwidth solution enables customers to activate additional bandwidth when needed. Additionally, our global customer services team is committed to making our customers successful by providing the highest quality support services to deploy, operate and maintain their networks. We believe providing the most reliable products and differentiated customer experiences contribute to customer success and are major differentiators.


• | Driving cost structure optimization. In delivering innovative solutions to our customers, we are committed to cost structure efficiencies that enhance our ability to invest in research and development and drive profitability. In particular, we believe our vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities serve as a competitive advantage from a technology and supply chain perspective, and financially, enable a lower cost structure and thus, higher profitability.


• | Utilizing automation to deliver differentiated solutions. We believe we lead the industry in ease of use and automation, facilitated by our software capabilities. We continue to invest in our differentiated technologies, including enhancing capabilities of our Instant Bandwidth offerings. We are extending the management and control capabilities across our entire product portfolio with the Xceed Software Suite, which enables customers to efficiently utilize network resources. Additionally, based on customers’ desire for more programmable networks, we have added open application programming interfaces (“APIs”) to our solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and automate operations.

Customers
Our customer verticals include:

• | Tier-1 carriers for domestic and international networks;


• | Tier-2 and Tier-3 carriers;


• | ICP and data center operators;


• | multiple system operators/cable providers;


• | wholesale and enterprise carriers;


• | submarine network operators;


• | enterprise customers; and


• | research and education/government entities.

We sell our products directly to customers who are end-users and to channel partners that sell on our behalf. We do not have long-term sales commitments from our customers. One customer, which completed a merger in late 2017, was a combination of two of our historically larger customers who merged in 2017 and accounted for approximately 18% of our revenue in 2017. These two historically larger customers each individually accounted for approximately 16% and 8% of our revenue in 2016, respectively, and approximately 17% and 13% of our revenue in 2015, respectively. No other customers accounted for over 10% of our revenue for these periods.
Technology
Infinera Intelligent Transport Network Architecture
We were founded with a vision of enabling an infinite pool of intelligent bandwidth upon which the next communications infrastructure is built. We have focused our efforts and capital on developing application-optimized platforms that enable customers to create rich end-user experiences delivered through efficient, high-bandwidth transport characterized by the following attributes:

• | Scalable. The proliferation of data centers, rise of cloud computing, increasing consumption of video and growth in mobile access is fundamentally changing traffic characteristics in operator networks. We currently deliver terabit class coherent, sliceable super-channels, which allow a massive pool of bandwidth to be provisioned in a single operation. Sliceable photonics enable network operators to benefit from high capacity super-channels and also achieve wavelength granularity for wide-ranging control of the network.


• | Flexible. We offer a mix of integrated and disaggregated platforms to reduce complexity and enable flexibility as network architectures evolve. There are varying customer preferences as some service providers continue to favor integrated multi-service mesh networks while traffic driven by ICPs is increasingly serviced by disaggregated platforms that address point-to-point connections.

3


• | Open. Network operators are facing intensifying competition to meet customer demand for immediate bandwidth and better visibility into the network. Our Intelligent Transport Networks feature highly programmable platforms with SDN APIs enabling networks to be open; this helps simplify end to end multi-layer provisioning. Additionally, there is growing demand from certain customers for line systems that are open, which entails having the ability to use transponders from one vendor over a different vendor’s line system. We are addressing this dynamic, both by seeking opportunities to sell our transponders over other vendors’ line systems and also offering our own open platform that supports both fixed and flexible grid technology, thus allowing a seamless mix of transponders from multiple vendors.

Infinera Optical Engines
We believe our optical engines, with the latest version being ICE4, are key to our value proposition and a competitive advantage. Technologically, we are able to deliver multi-terabit class coherent super-channels through PICs in systems that significantly exceed reliability standards. Additionally, DSPs enable network operators to utilize coherent technologies to enable higher data capacity transmissions over existing optical fiber infrastructure. We have integrated advanced coherent technologies onto our FlexCoherent DSP in ICE4, such as cutting-edge Nyquist subcarriers and soft-decision forward error correction gain sharing techniques. We use third-party components for specific applications such as multi-service packet within metro platforms. Financially, we believe our technology approach enables improved manufacturing economics for optical networking, allowing future optical transport cost reductions to be viably sustained on a cost curve defined by volume manufacturing efficiencies and greater functional integration.
Super-Channels and Sliceable Photonics 
Infinera’s DTN-X and Cloud Xpress Family of products are designed to support multiple channels, each up to 200 Gb/s capacity, in a single line card or unit depending on the platform form factor. This pool of bandwidth can either be managed as a single super-channel, with currently up to 1.2 Tb/s that can be deployed in a single operation or sliced into smaller increments to allow operators more flexibility. In order to achieve the same system capacity, competitive solutions require the installation of multiple discrete line modules or units, each turned up with its own operation. Super-channels result in competitive advantages leading to lower operational costs and long-term system reliability, as well as significant reductions in installation time. Our ICE4 technology combines the benefits of super-channels with the capability of being able to slice capacity into lower unit increments such as 100 Gb/s. Each increment can be tuned and routed in multiple separate directions, with each fully tuned to its own flexible grid frequency as well as having its own coherent modulation profile. This significantly reduces the number of modules required in networks, resulting in lower total cost of ownership and a highly flexible optical transport network. 
Infinera Instant Bandwidth
Infinera Instant Bandwidth enables customers to license a super-channel pool of bandwidth in smaller increments such as 100 Gb/s. With Infinera Instant Bandwidth technology, which is available on the Infinera DTN-X XTC Series, DTN-X XT Series, DTN-X XTS Series, Cloud Xpress Family and XTM Series platforms, customers can provision additional transmission capacity on demand without the deployment of any incremental equipment. The Infinera Instant Bandwidth technology is uniquely enabled by our hardware, providing customers the ability to adopt a success-based business model for network growth. 
Security and Software-enabled Automation 
Unified network management, control and security is critical to achieving service simplicity. Our Xceed Software Suite is a portfolio of products that combines an open, multi-layer SDN control platform with applications that enhance revenue sources while increasing network efficiency. Our Xceed Software Suite is designed for multi-layer networks and unified SDN control across end-to-end transport networks, helping customers automate and simplify operations. Our advanced security capabilities within the Infinite Capacity Engine (ICE) are designed to provide strong encryption at the transport layer processed using hardware at line-rate speeds, with the highest levels of data protection.

Our support organization continues to scale and provide world-class services that successfully support customers around the world. In addition, we continue to expand our services portfolio to meet the evolving needs of our customers.
Competition
Our current technologies and platforms support the long-haul, subsea, DCI and metro markets. The optical transport networking equipment market is highly competitive and competition in the markets we serve is based on any one or a combination of the following factors:

• | price and other commercial terms;


• | functionality;


• | existing business and customer relationships;


• | the ability of products and services to meet customers’ immediate and future network requirements;


• | power consumption;


• | heat dissipation;


• | form factor or density;


• | installation and operational simplicity;


• | service and support;


• | security and encryption requirements;


• | scalability and investment protection; and


• | product lead times.

Competition in the optical transport equipment market is intense. In the long-haul market, our main competitors include WDM systems suppliers such as Ciena, Coriant, Huawei, Nokia and ZTE. In the metro market, we face the same competitors as in long-haul, plus Cisco, Adva Optical Networking and Fujitsu. In addition, we have started to face competition in the DCI market from vendors that are selling optical components directly to customers, as opposed to WDM systems. In addition to our current competitors, other companies have, or may in the future, develop products that are, or could be, competitive with our products. We also may encounter competitor consolidation in the markets in which we compete, which could lead to a changing competitive landscape, capabilities and market share, and could impact our results of operations.
Some of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition, technical, financial and marketing resources, and better established relationships with potential customers than we have. Many of our competitors have more resources and more experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies, and in creating market awareness for those products and technologies. In addition, many of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively. Further, many of our competitors have built long-standing relationships with some of our prospective and existing customers, and have the ability to provide financing to customers and could, therefore, have an inherent advantage in selling products to those customers.
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our products and related support services primarily through our direct sales force, supported by marketing and product management personnel. We also use distribution or support partners to enter new markets or when requested by a potential customer. Our sales team has significant previous experience with the buying process and sales cycles typical of high-value telecommunications products.
The sales process for our products entails discussions with prospective customers, analyzing their networks and identifying how they can utilize our systems capabilities within their networks. This process requires developing strong customer relationships and leveraging our sales force and customer support capabilities to do so.
Over the course of the sales cycle, potential customers often test our products before buying. Prior to commercial deployment, the customer will generally perform a field trial of our products. Upon successful completion, the customer generally accepts the products installed in its network and may continue with commercial deployment of additional products. We anticipate that our sales cycle, from initial contact with a prospective customer through the signing of a purchase agreement may, in some cases, take several quarters.

Direct Sales Force. Our sales team sells directly to service providers worldwide. We maintain a sales presence throughout the United States, as well as in a number of international locations, including Argentina, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Adding incremental sales headcount in the future is expected to be success-based and in support of new customer accounts or expansion of existing ones.
Indirect Sales Force. We employ business consultants and resale and logistics partners to assist in our sales efforts, primarily in new regions for us whereby these partners have deep knowledge of typical business practices and strong relationships with key local operators. We expect to work with business partners to assist our customers in the sale, deployment and maintenance of our systems and have entered into distribution and resale agreements to facilitate the sale and support of our products.
Marketing and Product Management. Our product management team is responsible for defining the product features and go-to-market plan required to maximize our success in the marketplace. Product management supports our sales efforts with product and application expertise. Our corporate marketing team works to create demand for our products by communicating our value proposition and differentiation through direct customer interaction, public relations, attendance at tradeshows and other events, as well as internet programs and other marketing channels.
Research and Development
Continued investment in research and development is critical to our business. To this end, we have assembled a team of engineers with expertise in various fields, including systems, sub-systems, software and components. Our research and development efforts are currently focused in Sunnyvale, California; Allentown, Pennsylvania; Bangalore, India; Kanata, Canada; and Stockholm, Sweden. We utilize a mix of internal resources and supplement our staffing with development personnel provided by third parties on a contract basis. We have invested significant time and financial resources into the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products. We will continue to expand our product offerings and the capabilities of existing products in the future and plan to dedicate significant resources to these continued research and development efforts. We are continually increasing the scalability and software features of our current platforms. We are also working to develop new generations of optical engines at a faster cadence than we have historically in order to bring new products to market faster and meet customer demand. We believe these efforts will enhance our competitiveness in the markets we currently serve and also allow us to address adjacent markets to fuel our future growth.
Our research and development expenses were $224.3 million, $232.3 million and $180.7 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Employees
As of December 30, 2017, we had 2,145 employees. A total of 1,003 of those employees were located outside of the United States. None of our U.S. employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Employees in certain foreign jurisdictions may be represented by local workers’ councils and/or collective bargaining agreements, as may be customary or required in those jurisdictions. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our employee relationships to be good.
Manufacturing
We have invested significant time and capital to develop and improve the manufacturing processes we use to produce and package our products. This includes significant investments in personnel, equipment and the facilities needed to manufacture and package our products in Sunnyvale, California and Allentown, Pennsylvania. We also have invested in automating our manufacturing process and in training and maintaining the quality of our manufacturing workforce. As a leader in the development of photonic integration, our manufacturing processes have been developed over several years and are protected through a combination of trade secrets, patents and contractual protections. We believe that the investments we have made towards the manufacturing and packaging of our products provide us with a significant competitive advantage. We also believe that our current manufacturing facilities, including our fabrication facility for our PICs in Sunnyvale, California, and our module manufacturing facility in Allentown, Pennsylvania can accommodate an increase in production capacity as our business continues to grow.
            We also use contract manufacturers to assemble portions of our products. Each contract manufacturer procures components necessary to assemble products according to our specifications and bills of material. For elements of our business where we outsource, we perform rigorous in-house quality control testing to ensure the reliability of our products. Our supply chain risk mitigation strategies are continuous and institutionalized in our supply chain design for external manufacturing and for procurement of components. We currently use four contract manufacturers in six different countries, China, Malaysia, Mexico, Sweden, Hungary and Thailand, as well as the capability to redirect manufacturing to U.S. qualified factories of three electronic manufacturing services partners.
7

We expect all suppliers to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which addresses the rights of workers to safe and healthy working conditions, environmental responsibility and compliance with applicable laws.
Backlog
As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our total order backlog was approximately $100.9 million and $74.0 million, respectively. Our backlog represents purchase orders received from customers for future product shipments and services. Our backlog is subject to future events that could cause the amount or timing of the related revenue to change, and, in certain cases, may be canceled without penalty. Orders in backlog may be fulfilled several quarters following receipt or may relate to multi-year support service obligations. As a result, we believe that backlog should not be viewed as an accurate indicator of future operating results for any particular period. A backlogged order may not result in revenue in a particular period, and the actual revenue may not be equal to our backlog amounts. Our presentation of backlog may not be comparable with that of other companies in our industry.
Intellectual Property
We believe our success depends upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections.
Our optical engine technology, including our PIC, DSP, module and related technologies, are protected through a combination of patents, trade secrets and contractual protections. However, there can be no assurances that these protections will be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage or that others have not or will not reverse engineer our designs or discover, develop or disclose the same or similar designs and manufacturing processes.
As of December 30, 2017, we held 430 U.S. patents and 123 international patents expiring between 2021 and 2037, and held 122 U.S. and 21 foreign pending patent applications. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims.
We may not receive any competitive advantages from the rights granted under our patents and other intellectual property. Any patents granted to us may be contested, circumvented or invalidated over the course of our business, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing these patents. Therefore, the impact of these patents cannot be predicted with certainty.
We believe that the frequency of assertions of patent infringement is increasing as patent holders, including entities that are not in our industry and who purchase patents as an investment or to monetize such rights by obtaining royalties, use such actions as a competitive tactic as well as a source of additional revenue. For example, we are currently involved in litigation for alleged patent infringement. See Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” for additional information regarding this lawsuit. Any claim of infringement from a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claims, and could distract our management from running our business. Furthermore, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or could include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products. In addition, we might be required to seek a license for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which would require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful.
In addition to trade secret and patent protections, we generally control access to and the use of our proprietary software and other confidential information. This protection is accomplished through a combination of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and through a combination of U.S. and international copyright laws.
We license some of our software pursuant to agreements that impose restrictions on our customers’ ability to use such software, such as prohibiting reverse engineering and limiting the use of copies. We also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by relying on non-disclosure and assignment of intellectual property agreements with our employees and consultants that acknowledge our exclusive ownership of all intellectual property developed by the individual during the course of his or her work with us. The agreements also require that each person maintain the confidentiality of all proprietary information disclosed to them. Other parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us, and we may not be able to enforce our rights adequately against these parties. We also rely on contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products.
We incorporate free and open source licensed software into our products. Although we monitor our use of such open source software closely, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In addition, non-compliance with open source software 
8

license terms and conditions could subject us to potential liability, including intellectual property infringement and or contractual claims. In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished in a timely manner, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
Environmental Matters
We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, products and services. Our business and operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that have been adopted with respect to the environment, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directive, Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”), and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulations adopted by the European Union. Environmental regulation is increasing and we expect that our operations will be subject to additional environmental compliance requirements, which may expose us to additional costs. We are also subject to disclosure requirements related to the presence of "conflict minerals" in our products. To date, our compliance costs relating to environmental regulations have not resulted in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Business Segment Data and Our Foreign Operations
