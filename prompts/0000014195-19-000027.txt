Engines Segment
General
Briggs & Stratton manufactures four-cycle aluminum alloy gasoline engines with gross horsepower ranging from 2.5hp up to 40hp and torque ranging from 4.50 ft-lbs gross torque to 21.00 ft-lbs gross torque. The Company’s engines are used primarily by the lawn and garden equipment industry, which accounted for 89% of the Engines segment's fiscal 2019 engine sales to OEMs. Major lawn and garden equipment applications include walk-behind lawn mowers, riding lawn mowers, garden tillers and snow throwers. The remaining 11% of engine sales to OEMs in fiscal 2019 was for use on products for industrial, construction, agricultural and other commercial and consumer applications that include portable and standby generators, pumps and pressure washers. Many retailers specify the Company's engines on the power equipment they sell and the Briggs & Stratton logo is often featured prominently on a product because of the appeal and reputation of the brand. The Company mainly sells commercial engines under the Vanguard® name.
In fiscal 2019, approximately 30% of the Engines segment net sales was derived from sales in international markets, primarily to customers in Europe. The Company serves its key international markets through its European regional office in Switzerland, its distribution center in the Netherlands and sales and service subsidiaries in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, England, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, Spain, and Sweden. Briggs & Stratton is a leading supplier of gasoline engines in developed countries where there is an established lawn and garden equipment market. Briggs & Stratton also exports engines to developing nations where its engines are used in agricultural, marine, construction and other applications. More information about its foreign operations is in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company's engines are sold primarily by its worldwide sales force through direct interaction with customers. The Company’s marketing staff and engineers provide support and technical assistance to its sales force.
The Engines segment also manufactures replacement engines and service parts and sells them to sales and service distributors. The Company owns 38% of Power Distributors LLC, a joint venture with a national 
distribution network of service parts in the United States. The Company's remaining domestic distributors are independently owned and operated. 
The Company owns its principal international distribution centers, but also uses independently owned and operated distributors. These distributors supply service parts and replacement engines directly to independently owned, authorized service dealers throughout the world. These distributors and service dealers incorporate the Company’s commitment to reliability and service.
Customers
The Company's engine sales are primarily to OEMs. The Company's major external engine customers in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 were MTD Products Inc. (MTD), Husqvarna Outdoor Products Group (HOP), Deere & Company, and Power Distributors, LLC. Engines segment sales to the top three customers combined were 44%, 42% and 47% of Engines segment sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Under purchasing plans available to all of its gasoline engine customers, Briggs & Stratton typically enters into annual engine supply arrangements. In certain cases, the Company has entered into longer supply arrangements of two to three years.
The Company believes that in fiscal 2019 approximately 71% of all residential lawn and garden powered equipment sold in the United States was sold through mass merchandisers such as The Home Depot, Inc. (The Home Depot), Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (Lowe’s), Sears Holdings Corporation (Sears) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Wal-Mart). Given the buying power of the mass merchandisers, Briggs & Stratton, through its customers, has continued to experience pricing pressure; however, the development of new and innovative products may assist the Company and its customers in realizing higher margins. The Company believes commercial engines are mainly sold through independent dealer networks.
Competition
The Company’s major competitors in engine manufacturing are Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (Honda), Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. (Kawasaki) and Kohler Co. (Kohler). Several Japanese and Chinese small engine manufacturers, of which Honda and Kawasaki are the largest, compete directly with the Company in world markets in the sale of engines to other OEMs and indirectly through their sale of end products.
The Company believes it has a significant share of the worldwide market for engines that power residential outdoor equipment.
The Company believes the major areas of competition from all engine manufacturers include product quality, brand, price, delivery and service. Other factors affecting competition are short-term market share objectives, short-term profit objectives, exchange rate fluctuations, technology, new product innovation, product support, distribution strength, and advertising. The Company believes its technology, product value, distribution, marketing, and service reputation have given it strong brand name recognition and enhanced its competitive position.
Seasonality of Demand
Sales of engines to lawn and garden OEMs are highly seasonal because of consumer buying patterns. The majority of lawn and garden equipment is sold during the spring and summer months when most lawn care and gardening activities are performed. Sales of lawn and garden equipment are also influenced by consumer sentiment, employment levels, new and existing home sales and weather conditions. Engine sales in the Company’s third fiscal quarter have historically been the highest, while sales in the first fiscal quarter have historically been the lowest.
In order to efficiently use its capital investments and meet seasonal demand for engines, the Company pursues a relatively balanced production schedule throughout the year. The schedule is adjusted to reflect changes in estimated demand, customer inventory levels and other matters outside the control of the Company. Accordingly, inventory levels generally increase during the first and second fiscal quarters in anticipation of customer demand. Inventory levels begin to decrease as sales increase in the third fiscal quarter. This seasonal pattern results in high inventories and low cash flow for the Company in the first, second and the beginning of the third fiscal quarters. The pattern generally results in higher cash flow in the 
latter portion of the third fiscal quarter and in the fourth fiscal quarter as inventories are liquidated and receivables are collected.
Manufacturing
The Company manufactures engines and parts at the following locations: Auburn, Alabama; Statesboro, Georgia; Murray, Kentucky; Poplar Bluff, Missouri; Wauwatosa, Wisconsin; and Chongqing, China. Briggs & Stratton has a parts distribution center in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin and Wijchen, Netherlands. The Engines segment also purchases certain products under contract manufacturing agreements.
The Company manufactures a majority of the structural components used in its engines, including aluminum die castings, carburetors and ignition systems. The Company purchases certain parts such as piston rings, spark plugs, valves, ductile and grey iron castings, plastic components, some stampings and screw machine parts and smaller quantities of other components. Raw material purchases consist primarily of aluminum and steel. The Company believes its sources of supply are adequate.
The Company has joint ventures with Daihatsu Motor Company for the manufacture of engines in Japan, and with Starting Industrial of Japan for the production of rewind starters and punch pressed components in the United States. During fiscal 2018, the Company announced its business optimization program. The program included, among other things, moving production of larger commercial engines, which were sourced from the joint venture with Daihatsu Motor Company, to two of its existing U.S. plants. Production of Vanguard engines in the Company’s U.S. plants began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and additional lines were phased in by the end of the fiscal 2019.
On August 15, 2019, the Company announced a plan to consolidate the Company’s production of small vertical shaft engines into its Poplar Bluff, Missouri facility. This decision was made after a comprehensive evaluation of the Company’s manufacturing operations. The Company’s Murray, Kentucky facility currently manufactures small vertical shaft engines and will be closed as a result of this consolidation.
Products Segment
General
The Products segment’s principal product lines include lawn and garden power equipment, turf care products, portable and standby generators, pressure washers, snow throwers, and job site products. The Products segment sells its products primarily through multiple channels of retail distribution, including consumer home centers, warehouse clubs, mass merchants, independent dealers and distributors, and on-line merchants. The Company sells its lawn and garden products, turf care products, snow throwers, and standby generators primarily through an independent dealer network and sells its pressure washers and portable generators primarily through the U.S. mass retail channel. To support its international business, the Products segment has leveraged the existing Briggs & Stratton worldwide distribution network and regional sales offices. The Company sells its job site products primarily into the rental channel to the construction and infrastructure, mining and oil & gas industries.
Beginning in fiscal 2014, the Company joined with one of its independent distributors to form Power Distributors, LLC to distribute certain service parts in the United States. During fiscal years 2014 through 2016, the venture acquired other independent distributors. In fiscal 2016, the venture achieved a national distribution network. 
The Products segment product lines are marketed under its own brands such as Briggs & Stratton®, Simplicity®, Snapper®, Snapper Pro®, Ferris®, Allmand®, Billy Goat®, Hurricane®, Murray®, Branco® and Victa®, as well as other brands such as Craftsman and Troy-Bilt. 
Customers
Historically, the Products’ segment major customers have included Lowe’s, Sears, PACE Inc., The Home Depot, Bunnings Warehouse, as well as numerous other distributors and dealers. Sales to the top three customers combined were 29%, 24% and 25% of Products segment net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Commercial mowers are primarily sold through independent dealers.
Competition
The principal competitive factors in the outdoor power products industry include price, service, product performance, brand, innovation and delivery. The Products segment has various competitors, depending on the type of equipment. Primary competitors include: Honda (portable generators, pressure washers and lawn and garden equipment), Generac Power Systems, Inc. (portable and standby generators and job site products), Alfred Karcher GmbH & Co. (pressure washers), Techtronic Industries (pressure washers and portable generators), Deere & Company (commercial and consumer lawn mowers), MTD (consumer lawn mowers), The Toro Company (commercial and consumer lawn mowers), Scag Power Equipment, a Division of Metalcraft of Mayville, Inc. (commercial lawn mowers), and HOP (commercial and consumer lawn mowers).
Seasonality of Demand
A significant portion of Products’ sales are subject to seasonal patterns. Due to seasonal and regional weather factors, sales of pressure washers and lawn and garden powered equipment are typically higher during the third and fourth fiscal quarters than at other times of the year. Sales of portable generators and snow throwers are typically higher during the first and second fiscal quarters and can spike during weather related power outage events. 
Manufacturing
The Products segment's manufacturing facilities are located in Sherrill, New York; Munnsville, New York; Wauwatosa, Wisconsin; Holdrege, Nebraska; Lee's Summit, Missouri; and Kemps Creek, Australia. The Products segment also purchases certain powered equipment under contract manufacturing agreements. 
The Products segment manufactures core components for its products, where such integration improves operating profitability by providing lower costs.
The Products segment purchases engines from the Engines segment, as well as from Honda, Kawasaki and Kohler. The Products segment has not typically experienced any difficulty obtaining necessary engines or other purchased components.
The Products segment assembles products for the international markets at its U.S. and Australian locations and through contract manufacturing agreements with other OEMs and suppliers.
During fiscal 2018, the Company announced its business optimization program. The program included, among other things, expanding capacity and moving the commercial turf equipment operation into a larger, more efficient facility in Sherrill, New York close to the facility in Munnsville, New York. Production of Ferris commercial mowers began in the new facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and all remaining production was transitioned in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
Consolidated
General Information
The Company holds patents on features incorporated in its products; however, the success of the Company’s business is not considered to be primarily dependent upon patent protection. The Company owns several trademarks which it believes significantly affect a consumer’s choice of outdoor powered equipment and job site products, and therefore create value. Licenses, franchises and concessions are not a material factor in the Company’s business.
For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017, the Company spent approximately $22.8 million, $23.6 million and $23.0 million, respectively, on research activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products.
The average number of persons employed by the Company during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 was 5,251 and 5,258, respectively. Employment in fiscal 2019 ranged from a high of 5,341 in December 2019 to a low of 5,152 in August 2018.
Export Sales
Export sales for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $316.1 million (17% of net sales), $324.4 million (17% of net sales), and $337.1 million (19% of net sales), respectively. These sales were principally to customers in Europe, Asia, Australia, and Canada.
