ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In September 2021 we determined to revitalize the “World Championship Air Race Series” which had been developed by Red Bull GmbH, the worldwide energy drinks company, for marketing purposes and promoted as the “Red Bull Air Race.” Red Bull hosted 94 championship races around the globe until it elected to terminate the Series in 2019. Over the course of the Series, it attracted viewers in 187 countries and was broadcast to an audience of over 230 million viewers. It is estimated to have achieved 2.3 billion media impressions worldwide in its 2019 season and AC Nielsen forecast that each race in the 2022 season would attract a TV audience of 49.5 million. It is the largest live spectator sports event in the world attracting over 1 million spectators to a single air race on multiple occasions in cities such as Rio De Janeiro and Barcelona.
 
As part of our effort to restore the WCAR, we engaged key operational staff which planned and staged the races for Red Bull and acquired certain rights to the Series. We have contacted previous host cities and have entered into agreements to host Air Race World Championships for the 2022 race season in the United Kingdom, Australia, Malaysia and Jakarta and are currently in discussions with two additional cities. We have scheduled the season opener for Goodwood in the United Kingdom on July 9th and 10th. Twelve Elite Race Teams have already signed-up for the 2022, 2023 and 2024 race seasons and Red Bull has indicated it will maintain its interest in the Air Race with continued sponsorship of former World Champion Martin Sonka in the Elite series.
 
In addition to promoting the WCAR, we are a media and technology software development and holding company. We have developed and license a robust fan engagement platform designed to enhance fan experience and drive commercial aspects of the sports and entertainment business.
 
We bring users closer to the action by enabling them to engage with clubs, favorite players, peers and relevant brands through features available through the Touchpoint platform and related apps (the “TP Platform”), that include live streaming, access to limited edition merchandise, metaverse ready gamification, user rewards, third party branded offers, credit cards and associated benefits.
 
We will utilize our expertise in fan engagement to enhance the experience of fans of the WCAR. Through the use of leading-edge VR and AR technology will transform the experience for viewers on television and our streaming platform enabling us to generate additional revenues through ticketing, merchandising, gamification and payment Apps.
 
The Touchpoint Platform:
 
The TP Platform is designed to enhance the fan experience and drive commercial aspects of the sports and entertainment business. The features of the platform include live streaming, video content library, access to limited edition merchandise including collectables such as limited-edition videos and other digitized media files (non-fungible tokens (NFT)), full end to end shop module, metaverse ready gamification, user rewards, third party branded offers, credit cards and associated benefits. The platform provides in-depth analytics that enable marketing teams to ensure that they deliver aligned, strategic messages and campaigns to the right audience at the right time.

Our Strategy
 
We have already contacted a number of prospective host cities and experienced air race teams as part of the process of organizing the 2022 season. We have entered into agreements to host Air Race World Championships for the 2022 race season in the United Kingdom, Australia, Malaysia and Jakarta and are currently in discussions with two additional cities. To enhance the appeal of the Series, we intend to showcase the latest technological developments in the application of green power in the aerospace industry along with aircraft with the latest advanced forms of mobility. Races will focus on future technologies, innovation, clean energy and lightweight mass market vehicles. New race categories will feature electric powered vehicles, vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) and jetpacks.
 
We will use our TP Platform to provide fans with access to the race teams and host cities, providing for merchandising events, broadcasting opportunities, gamification, ticketing, collectables, pay per view and ongoing subscriptions. Promotion of the WCAR will showcase the features of the TP Platform to other potential users and should accelerate discussions with athletes and celebrities interested in using the TP Platform to engage with their fan bases through content and other features.
 
In addition to promoting the WCAR and seeking to grow the customer base of Touchpoint, we will continue to look at opportunities for growth in the media market through acquisition and promotion of other content, including the rights to other events in the digital media, sports and entertainment sectors which can be marketed and livestreamed to a world-wide fan base; as well as the acquisition of growing media and software companies which offer the ability to expand the services we provide to our clients.
