 Item 1.Business
 Overview
 Transocean Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries and predecessors, unless the context requires otherwise, “Transocean,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells.  As of February 19, 2018, we owned or had partial ownership interests in and operated 47 mobile offshore drilling units.  As of February 19, 2018, our fleet consisted of 27 ultra‑deepwater floaters, 12 harsh environment floaters, two deepwater floaters and six midwater floaters.  At February 19, 2018, we also had two ultra‑deepwater drillships under construction or under contract to be constructed.  Additionally, we operated two high‑specification jackups that were under contract when we sold the rigs, and we continue to operate such rigs until completion or novation of the respective drilling contracts.
 Our primary business is to contract our drilling rigs, related equipment and work crews predominantly on a dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells.  We specialize in technically demanding regions of the global offshore drilling business with a particular focus on ultra‑deepwater and harsh environment drilling services.  We believe our mobile offshore drilling fleet is one of the most versatile fleets in the world, consisting of drillship and semisubmersible floaters used in support of offshore drilling activities and offshore support services on a worldwide basis.
 Transocean Ltd. is a Swiss corporation with its registered office in Steinhausen, Canton of Zug and with principal executive offices located at Turmstrasse 30, 6312 Zug, Switzerland.  Our telephone number at that address is +41 41 749‑0500.  Our shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “RIG”.  For information about the revenues, operating income, assets and other information related to our business, our segments and the geographic areas in which we operate, see “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II. Item 8.

 Recent Developments
 Business combination—On August 13, 2017, we entered into the Transaction Agreement with Songa Offshore SE, a European public company limited by shares, or societas Europaea, existing under the laws of Cyprus (“Songa”).  On January 30, 2018, we completed our acquisition of an approximate 97.7 percent ownership interest in Songa.  By March 31, 2018, we expect to complete the acquisition of the remaining shares not owned by us through a compulsory acquisition, which is available to us under Cyprus law.  In connection with the acquisition, we acquired seven mobile offshore drillings units, including five harsh environment floaters and two midwater floaters.  In connection with the acquisition, we issued 66.9 million shares and an aggregate principal amount of $854 million of the 0.5% Exchangeable Senior Bonds due January 2023.  See “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and —Note 20—Subsequent Event.” Drilling Fleet
 Fleet overview—Our drilling fleet of floaters consists of drillships and semisubmersibles.  Most of our drilling equipment is suitable for both exploration and development, and we normally engage in both types of drilling activity.  All of our drilling rigs are mobile and can be moved to new locations in response to customer demand.  All of our mobile offshore drilling units are designed to operate in locations away from port for extended periods of time and have living quarters for the crews, a helicopter landing deck and storage space for drill pipe, riser and drilling supplies.
 Drillships are generally self‑propelled vessels, shaped like conventional ships, and are the most mobile of the major rig types.  All of our drillships are ultra‑deepwater capable and equipped with a computer‑controlled dynamic positioning thruster system, which allows them to maintain position without anchors through the use of their onboard propulsion and station‑keeping systems.  These rigs typically have greater deck load and storage capacity than early generation semisubmersible rigs, which provides logistical and resupply efficiency benefits for customers.  Drillships are generally better suited to operations in calmer sea conditions and typically do not operate in areas considered to be harsh environments.  We have 17 ultra‑deepwater drillships that are, and two ultra‑deepwater drillships under construction that will be, equipped with our patented dual‑activity technology.  Dual‑activity technology employs structures, equipment and techniques using two drilling stations within a dual derrick to allow these drillships to perform simultaneous drilling tasks in a parallel, rather than a sequential manner, which reduces critical path activity and improves efficiency in both exploration and development drilling.  In addition to dynamic positioning thruster systems, dual‑activity technology, industry‑leading hoisting capacity and a second blowout preventer system, our two newbuild drillships under construction will be outfitted to accommodate a future upgrade to a 20,000 pounds per square inch (“psi”) blowout preventer.
 Semisubmersibles are floating vessels that can be partially submerged by means of a water ballast system such that the lower column sections and pontoons are below the water surface during drilling operations.  These rigs are capable of maintaining their position over a well through the use of an anchoring system or a computer‑controlled dynamic positioning thruster system.  Although most semisubmersible rigs are relocated with the assistance of tugs, some units are self‑propelled and move between locations under their own power when afloat on pontoons.  Typically, semisubmersibles are capable of operating in rougher sea conditions than drillships.  We have two custom‑designed, high‑capacity, dual‑activity semisubmersible drilling rigs, equipped for year‑round operations in harsh environments,

including those of the Norwegian continental shelf and sub‑Arctic waters.  Five of our 24 semisubmersibles are equipped with our patented dual‑activity technology and also have mooring capability.
 Fleet categories—We further categorize the drilling units of our fleet as follows: (1) “ultra‑deepwater floaters,” (2) “harsh environment floaters,” (3) “deepwater floaters” and (4) “midwater floaters”.  Ultra‑deepwater floaters are equipped with high‑pressure mud pumps and are capable of drilling in water depths of 7,500 feet or greater.  Harsh environment floaters are capable of drilling in harsh environments in water depths between 1,500 and 10,000 feet and have greater displacement, which offers larger variable load capacity, more useable deck space and better motion characteristics.  Deepwater floaters are generally those other semisubmersible rigs and drillships capable of drilling in water depths between 4,500 and 7,500 feet.  Midwater floaters are generally comprised of those non‑high‑specification semisubmersibles that have a water depth capacity of less than 4,500 feet.
 As of February 19, 2018, we owned and operated a fleet of 47 rigs, including the seven rigs recently acquired in the Songa acquisition and excluding two newbuilds under construction, as follows:

§ | 27 ultra‑deepwater floaters;
--+-----------------------------


§ | 12 harsh environment floaters;
--+-------------------------------


§ | Two deepwater floaters; and
--+----------------------------


§ | Six midwater floaters.
--+-----------------------

 
Fleet status—Depending on market conditions, we may idle or stack non‑contracted rigs.  An idle rig is between drilling contracts, readily available for operations, and operating costs are typically at or near normal levels.  A stacked rig typically has reduced operating costs, is staffed by a reduced crew or has no crew and is (a) preparing for an extended period of inactivity, (b) expected to continue to be inactive for an extended period, or (c) completing a period of extended inactivity.  Stacked rigs will continue to incur operating costs at or above normal operating levels for approximately 30 days following initiation of stacking.  Some idle rigs and all stacked rigs require additional costs to return to service.  The actual cost to return to service, which in many instances could be significant and could fluctuate over time, depends upon various factors, including the availability and cost of shipyard facilities, cost of equipment and materials and the extent of repairs and maintenance that may ultimately be required.  We consider these factors, together with market conditions, length of contract, dayrate and other contract terms, when deciding whether to return a stacked rig to service.  We may, from time to time, consider marketing stacked rigs as accommodation units or for other alternative uses until drilling activity increases and we obtain drilling contracts for these units.  We may not return some stacked rigs to work for drilling services or for these alternative uses.
 Drilling units—The following tables, presented as of February 19, 2018, provide certain specifications for our rigs, including the seven rigs recently acquired in the Songa acquisition.  Unless otherwise noted, the stated location of each rig indicates either the current drilling location, if the rig is operating, or the next operating location, if the rig is in shipyard with a follow‑on contract.  The dates provided represent the expected time of completion, the year placed into service, and, if applicable, the year of the most recent upgrade.  As of February 19, 2018, we owned all of the drilling rigs in our fleet noted in the tables below, except for the following: (1) the ultra‑deepwater floater Petrobras 10000, which is subject to a capital lease through August 2029, and (2) the ultra‑deepwater floater Discoverer Luanda, which is owned through our 65 percent ownership interest in Angola Deepwater Drilling Company Ltd. (“ADDCL”).

 Markets
 Our operations are geographically dispersed in oil and gas exploration and development areas throughout the world.  We operate in a single, global offshore drilling market, as our drilling rigs are mobile assets and are able to be moved according to prevailing market conditions.  We may mobilize our drilling rigs between regions for a variety of reasons, including to respond to customer contracting requirements or capture demand in another locale.  Consequently, we cannot predict the percentage of our revenues that will be derived from particular geographic or political areas in future periods.
 As of February 19, 2018, our drilling fleet, including stacked and idle rigs, but excluding rigs under construction, was located in the Norwegian North Sea (ten units), the United States (“U.S.”) Gulf of Mexico (ten units), Trinidad (seven units), United Kingdom (“U.K.”) North Sea (five units), Malaysia (four units), India (three units), Canada (two units), Aruba (one unit), Australia (one unit), Brazil (one units), Ivory Coast (one unit), Myanmar (one unit), and Romania (one unit).
 We categorize the market sectors in which we operate as follows: (1) ultra-deepwater, (2) deepwater and (3) midwater.  The ultra‑deepwater, deepwater and midwater market sectors, collectively known as the floater market, are serviced by our drillships and semisubmersibles, 12 of which are suited to work in harsh environments.  We generally view the ultra-deepwater market sector as water depths beginning at 7,500 feet and extending to the maximum water depths in which rigs are capable of drilling, which is currently up to 12,000 feet.  The deepwater market sector services water depths beginning at approximately 4,500 feet to approximately 7,500 feet, and the midwater market sector services water depths from approximately 300 feet to approximately 4,500 feet.
 The market for offshore drilling rigs and related services reflects oil companies’ demand for equipment for drilling exploration, appraisal and development wells and for performing maintenance on existing production wells. Activity levels of exploration and production (“E&P”) companies and their associated capital expenditures are largely driven by the worldwide demand for energy, including crude oil and natural gas.  Worldwide energy supply and demand drives oil and natural gas prices, which, in turn, impact E&P companies’ ability to fund investments in exploration, development and production activities.
 The industry is continuing to experience a cyclical downturn.  A multi‑year weak commodity pricing environment has resulted in our customers delaying investment decisions and postponing exploration and production programs.  Relative to years prior to the downturn, we have experienced significantly reduced demand, resulting in a decline in the execution of drilling contracts for the global offshore drilling fleet and an unprecedented level of early terminations and cancellations of drilling contracts.  Over the past year, however, opportunities have increased for our drilling services.  In markets requiring harsh environment floating drilling rigs, such as the Norwegian North Sea and eastern Canada, the limited supply of these specialized rigs has improved fleet utilization, which is resulting in increased dayrates on high‑specification rigs being tendered for new work. Outside of harsh environment markets, the excess supply of ultra‑deepwater floaters relative to demand continues and has delayed improvement of dayrates.  However, as the hydrocarbon supply‑demand balance improves, we expect sustained improvement of oil prices, ultimately resulting in greater demand for ultra‑deepwater drilling rigs and improvement of dayrates.  In this environment, older and less capable assets are more likely to be permanently retired, ultimately reducing the available supply of drilling rigs.  During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we sold for scrap value three, 11 and 17 drilling units, respectively, and at December 31, 2017, we had five additional rigs classified as held for sale for scrap value.
 Longer term, our outlook for the offshore drilling sector remains positive, particularly for high‑specification assets.  Prior to the downturn, Brazil, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and West Africa emerged as key ultra‑deepwater market sectors, and licensing activity

demonstrated an increased interest in deepwater fields as E&P companies looked to explore new prospects.  We expect deepwater oil and gas production will continue to be a part of the long‑term strategy for E&P companies as they strive to replace reserves to meet global demand for hydrocarbons.  As commodity prices stabilize and confidence improves in the stability of such price levels, we anticipate additional projects will be approved.  Typically, these projects are technically demanding due to factors such as water depth, complex well designs, deeper drilling depth, high pressure and temperature, sub‑salt, harsh environments, and heightened regulatory standards; therefore, they require sophisticated drilling units.  Generally, ultra‑deepwater rigs are the most modern, technologically advanced class of the offshore fleet and have capabilities that are attractive to E&P companies operating in deeper water depths, other challenging environments or with complex well designs.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business.”

  Contract Drilling Services
 Our contracts to provide offshore drilling services are individually negotiated and vary in their terms and provisions.  We obtain most of our drilling contracts through competitive bidding against other contractors and direct negotiations with operators.  Drilling contracts generally provide for payment on a dayrate basis, with higher rates for periods while the drilling unit is operating and lower rates or zero rates for periods of mobilization or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse environmental conditions or other conditions beyond our control.
 A dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well or group of wells or covering a stated term.  At December 31, 2017, the contract backlog was approximately $9.5 billion, representing a decrease of 19 percent and 41 percent, respectively, compared to the contract backlog at December 31, 2016 and 2015, which was $11.7 billion and $16.0 billion, respectively.  See “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Outlook—Performance and Other Key Indicators.”
 Certain of our drilling contracts may be cancelable for the convenience of the customer upon payment of an early termination payment.  Such payments, however, may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract.  Contracts also customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer, typically without the payment of any termination fee, under various circumstances such as non‑performance, in the event of extended downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or operational issues, or periods of extended downtime due to force majeure events.  Many of these events are beyond our control.  The contract term in some instances may be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional term.  Our contracts also typically include a provision that allows the customer to extend the contract to finish drilling a well‑in‑progress.  During periods of depressed market conditions, our customers may seek to renegotiate firm drilling contracts to reduce the term of their obligations or the average dayrate through term extensions, or may seek to repudiate their contracts.  Suspension of drilling contracts will result in the reduction in or loss of dayrate for the period of the suspension.  If our customers cancel some of our contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated, it could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows.  See

“Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—Our drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events, and, during depressed market conditions, our customers may seek to repudiate or renegotiate their contracts.”
 Consistent with standard industry practice, our customers generally assume, and indemnify us against, well control and subsurface risks under dayrate drilling contracts.  Under all of our current drilling contracts, our customers, as the operators, indemnify us for pollution damages in connection with reservoir fluids stemming from operations under the contract and we indemnify the operator for pollution from substances in our control that originate from the rig, such as diesel used onboard the rig or other fluids stored onboard the rig and above the water surface.  Also, under all of our current drilling contracts, the operator indemnifies us against damage to the well or reservoir and loss of subsurface oil and gas and the cost of bringing the well under control.  However, our drilling contracts are individually negotiated, and the degree of indemnification we receive from the operator against the liabilities discussed above can vary from contract to contract, based on market conditions and customer requirements existing when the contract was negotiated.  In some instances, we have contractually agreed upon certain limits to our indemnification rights and can be responsible for damages up to a specified maximum dollar amount.  The nature of our liability and the prevailing market conditions, among other factors, can influence such contractual terms.  In most instances in which we are indemnified for damages to the well, we have the responsibility to redrill the well at a reduced dayrate.  Notwithstanding a contractual indemnity from a customer, there can be no assurance that our customers will be financially able to indemnify us or will otherwise honor their contractual indemnity obligations.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—Our business involves numerous operating hazards, and our insurance and indemnities from our customers may not be adequate to cover potential losses from our operations.”
 The interpretation and enforceability of a contractual indemnity depends upon the specific facts and circumstances involved, as governed by applicable laws, and may ultimately need to be decided by a court or other proceeding, which will need to consider the specific contract language, the facts and applicable laws.  The law generally considers contractual indemnity for criminal fines and penalties to be against public policy.  Courts also restrict indemnification for criminal fines and penalties.  The inability or other failure of our customers to fulfill their indemnification obligations, or unenforceability of our contractual protections could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  See “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies.”
 Significant Customers
 We engage in offshore drilling services for most of the leading international oil companies or their affiliates, as well as for many government‑controlled oil companies and independent oil companies.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, our most significant customers were Chevron Corporation (together with its affiliates, “Chevron”), Royal Dutch Shell plc (together with its affiliates, “Shell”) and Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (“Petrobras”), representing approximately 29 percent, 17 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues.  No other customers accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated operating revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017.  Additionally, as of February 19, 2018, the customers with the most significant aggregate amount of contract backlog associated with our drilling contracts were Shell, Statoil ASA (together with its affiliates, “Statoil”) and Chevron, representing approximately 52 percent, 31 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of our total contract backlog.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—We rely heavily on a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer or a dispute that leads to the loss of a customer could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.” Employees
 We require highly skilled personnel to operate our drilling units.  Consequently, we conduct extensive personnel recruiting, training and safety programs.  At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 4,900 employees, including approximately 400 persons engaged through contract labor providers.  Approximately 26 percent of our total workforce, working primarily in Brazil, Norway and the U.K. are represented by, and some of our contracted labor work is subject to, collective bargaining agreements, substantially all of which are subject to annual salary negotiation.  These negotiations could result in higher personnel expenses, other increased costs or increased operational restrictions, as the outcome of such negotiations affect the market for all offshore employees not just the union members.  Additionally, failure to reach agreement on certain key issues may result in strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages that may materially impact our operations. Joint Venture, Agency and Sponsorship Relationships and Other Investments
 In some areas of the world, local customs and practice or governmental requirements necessitate the formation of joint ventures with local participation.  We may or may not control these joint ventures.  We participate in several joint venture drilling companies, principally in Angola, Indonesia, Malaysia and Nigeria.  Local laws or customs in some areas of the world also effectively mandate the establishment of a relationship with a local agent or sponsor.  When appropriate in these areas, we enter into agency or sponsorship agreements.  At December 31, 2017, joint ventures in which we participate were as follows:
 We hold a 65 percent interest in ADDCL, a consolidated Cayman Islands joint venture company formed to own Discoverer Luanda.  Our local partner, Angco Cayman Limited, a Cayman Islands company, holds the remaining 35 percent interest in

ADDCL.  Angco Cayman Limited has the right to exchange its interest in the joint venture for cash at an amount based on an appraisal of the fair value of the drillship, subject to certain adjustments.
 We hold a 24 percent direct interest and a 36 percent indirect interest in Indigo Drilling Limited (“Indigo”), a consolidated Nigerian joint venture company formed to engage in drilling operations offshore Nigeria.  Our local partners, Mr. Fidelis Oditah and Mr. Chima Ibeneche, each hold a 12.5 percent direct interest, and our other partners, Mr. Joseph Obi and Mr. Ben Osuno, together own a 15 percent indirect interest, in Indigo.
 Additionally, we hold interests in certain joint venture companies in Angola, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and other countries that have been formed to perform certain management services and other onshore support services for our operations.
 Technological Innovation
 Since launching the offshore industry’s first jackup drilling rig in 1954, we have achieved a long history of technological innovations, including the first dynamically positioned drillship, the first rig to drill year‑round in the North Sea, the first 10,000‑ft. rated ultra‑deepwater drillship and the first semisubmersible rig for year‑round sub‑Arctic operations.  We have repeatedly achieved water depth world records in the past.  Twenty‑two drillships and semisubmersibles in our existing fleet are, and our two drillships that are under construction will be, equipped with our patented dual‑activity technology, which allows our rigs to perform simultaneous drilling tasks in a parallel rather than sequential manner and reduces critical path activity while improving efficiency in both exploration and development drilling.
 We continue to develop and deploy industry‑leading technology.  In addition to our patented dual‑activity drilling technology, two of our drillships under construction will include industry‑leading hookload capability, hybrid power systems for reduced fuel consumption and reduced emissions as well as advanced generator protection for power plant reliability.  We are focused on a breakthrough drilling innovation program that includes a fault‑resistant and fault‑tolerant blowout preventer control system.  Nine drillships in our existing fleet are, and our two drillships that are under construction will be, outfitted with two blowout preventers and triple liquid mud systems.  Five drillships in our existing fleet are, and our two drillships that are under construction will be, designed to accept 20,000 psi blowout preventers in the future.  Six of our harsh environment semi‑submersibles are designed and constructed specifically to provide highly efficient performance offshore Norway and in the Barents Sea.  We believe the continual improvement of, and effective use of, technology to meet or exceed our customers’ requirements is critical to maintain our competitive position within the contract drilling services industry.  Additionally, our digital transformation program delivers real‑time data feeds from equipment and processes, which is used to build machine health models.  These models allow us to systematically optimize equipment maintenance and achieve higher levels of operational efficiency.  This data‑driven approach, augmented by the size of our fleet, is helping us build a knowledge framework for sustainable process optimization.
 Environmental Compliance
 Our operations are subject to a variety of global environmental regulations.  We monitor our compliance with environmental regulation in each country of operation and, while we see an increase in general environmental regulation, we have made and will continue to make the required expenditures to comply with current and future environmental requirements.  We make expenditures to further our commitment to environmental improvement and the setting of a global environmental standard.  We assess the environmental impacts of our business, focusing on the areas of greenhouse gas emissions, climate change, discharges and waste management.  Our actions are designed to reduce risk in our current and future operations, to promote sound environmental management and to create a proactive environmental program.  To date, we have not incurred material costs in order to comply with recent environmental legislation, and we do not believe that our compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, consolidated results of operations or cash flows.  For a discussion of the effects of environmental regulation, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—Compliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly, expose us to liability and could limit our operations.” Available Information
