Item 1.  Business
Overview

We are one of the world’s leading global contract research organizations, or CROs, by revenue, providing outsourced clinical development and data solution services to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We believe we are one of a select group of CROs with the expertise and capability to conduct clinical trials across major therapeutic areas on a global basis. Our therapeutic expertise includes areas that are among the largest in pharmaceutical development, and we focus in particular on oncology, immunology, central nervous system, inflammation, respiratory, cardiometabolic and infectious diseases. We believe that we further differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our investments in medical informatics and clinical technologies designed to enhance efficiencies, improve study predictability and provide better transparency for our clients throughout their clinical development processes. Our Data Solutions segment allows us to better serve our clients across their entire product lifecycle by (i) improving clinical trial design, recruitment, and execution; (ii) creating real-world data solutions based on the use of medicines by actual patients in normal situations; and (iii) increasing the efficiency of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies' commercial organizations through enhanced analytics and outsourcing services.  

Our global clinical development platform includes more than 70 offices across North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America, South Africa, Australia and the Middle East and more than 16,400 employees worldwide. Since 2000, we have participated in more than 3,800 clinical trials worldwide, worked on marketed drugs across several therapeutic areas and conducted the pivotal or supportive trials that led to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or international regulatory approval of more than 85 drugs.

We offer flexible clinical development service offerings, which include embedded and functional outsourcing services in addition to traditional, project‑based clinical trial services. Our Strategic Solutions offerings provide Embedded Solutions™ and functional outsourcing services in which our teams are fully integrated within the client’s internal clinical development operations and are responsible for managing functions across the entire breadth of the client’s drug development pipeline. We believe that our Strategic Solutions offerings represent an innovative alternative to the traditional, project‑based approach and allow our clients to maintain greater control over their clinical development processes. Our flexible clinical development service offerings expand our addressable market beyond the traditional outsourced clinical development market to include the clinical development spending that biopharmaceutical companies historically have retained in‑house.
Over the past 30 years, we have developed strong client relationships and have performed services for more than 300 biotechnology and pharmaceutical clients. Our Strategic Solutions offerings have significantly expanded our relationships with large pharmaceutical companies in recent years, which has allowed us to pursue strategic alliances with these companies due to our global presence, broad therapeutic expertise and flexible clinical development service offerings. Additionally, we believe that we have built a reputation as a strategic partner of choice for biotechnology and small‑ to mid‑sized pharmaceutical companies as a result of our competitively-differentiated platform and our long‑term track record of serving these companies. 

CRO Industry

CROs provide drug development services, regulatory and scientific support, and infrastructure and staffing support to provide their clients with the flexibility to supplement their in‑house capabilities or to provide a fully outsourced solution. The CRO industry has grown from providing limited clinical trial services in the 1970s to a full-service industry characterized by broad relationships with clients and by service offerings that encompass the entire drug development process. Today, CROs provide a comprehensive range of clinical services, including protocol design and management and monitoring of Phase I through Phase IV clinical trials, data management, laboratory testing, medical and safety reviews and statistical analysis. In addition, CROs provide services that generate high quality and timely data in support of applications for regulatory approval of new drugs or reformulations of existing drugs as well as new and existing marketing claims. CROs leverage selected information technologies and procedures to efficiently capture, manage and analyze the large streams of data generated during a clinical trial.

Drug development processes

Discovering and developing new drugs is an expensive and time‑consuming process and is highly regulated and monitored through approval processes that vary by region. Before a new prescription drug reaches commercialization, it must undergo extensive pre‑clinical and clinical testing and regulatory review, to verify that the drug is safe and effective.

A drug is first tested in pre‑clinical studies, which can take several years to complete. When a new molecule is synthesized or discovered, it is tested for therapeutic value using various animal and tissue models. If the drug warrants further development, additional studies are completed and an investigational new drug application, or IND, is submitted to the FDA. Once the IND becomes effective, the drug may proceed to the human clinical trial phase which generally consists of the following interrelated phases, which may overlap:

Stages of Clinical Development


Market trends

Industry Standard Research, or ISR, a market research firm, estimated in its “2018 CRO Market Size Projections 2017-2022” report, or ISR 2018 Market Report, that the size of the worldwide CRO market was approximately $34 billion in 2017 and will grow at a 7.5% CAGR to $49 billion in 2022. This growth will be driven by an increase in the amount of research and development expenditure and levels of clinical development outsourcing by biopharmaceutical companies.

Increased R&D spending

ISR estimates in its 2018 Market Report that research and development, or R&D, expenditures by biopharmaceutical companies were approximately $293 billion in 2017 and will grow approximately 3% per year through 2022. Of this amount, approximately $121 billion was spent on development, including $86 billion on Phase I through IV clinical development. Growth drivers of R&D spending among biopharmaceutical companies include the need to replenish lost revenues resulting from the patent expirations of a large number of high‑profile drugs in recent years which has resulted in the need for biopharmaceutical companies to increase their R&D expenditures to eventually fill this revenue void with new drug approvals, and a healthy capital-raising environment among biotechnology companies in recent years. We believe biotechnology companies primarily use the capital to fund clinical trials, and due to the general lack of existing infrastructure, these trials are often contracted to CROs. 
Higher outsourcing penetration

ISR estimates in its 2018 Market Report that approximately 40% of Phase I through IV of clinical development spend is outsourced to CROs, and the levels of penetration are expected to increase to approximately 47% by 2022. We believe this increase in outsourcing is due to several factors, including the need to maximize R&D productively, the increasing burden of clinical trial complexity, and the desire to pursue simultaneous registration in multiple countries.


• | Maximizing Productivity and Reducing Cost—Productivity within the biopharmaceutical industry has declined over the past several years and the cost of developing a new drug has significantly increased. The combined impact of declining R&D productivity and increased development costs has translated into significant pressure on margins and short‑term earnings for biopharmaceutical companies. We believe that the need for these companies to maximize

productivity and lower costs will lead them to partner increasingly with CROs that can improve efficiency, and increase flexibility and speed across their clinical operations. 

• | Increasing Clinical Trial Complexity—Over the last decade, the burden of clinical trial complexity has been increasingly difficult to manage due to requirements from regulatory authorities worldwide for greater amounts of clinical trial and safety data to support the approval of new drugs, and requirements for adherence to increasingly complex and diverse regulations and guidelines. In an effort to minimize potential risks, these regulatory agencies also typically require a greater amount of post‑approval information and monitoring of drugs on the market. To balance the conflicting demands of a growing market with the need to control R&D expenses, biopharmaceutical companies partner with CROs that can provide services designed to generate high-quality and timely data in support of regulatory approvals of new drugs or the reformulations of existing drugs, as well as support of post‑approval regulatory requirements.


• | Simultaneous Multi‑Country Registration—Given their desire to maximize efficiency and global market penetration to achieve higher potential returns on their R&D expenditures, biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly pursuing simultaneous, rather than sequential, regulatory new drug submissions and approvals in multiple countries. However, most biotechnology and small‑ to mid‑sized pharmaceutical companies do not possess the capability or capacity to simultaneously conduct large‑scale clinical trials in more than one country. In addition, establishing and maintaining internal global infrastructure to pursue multiple regulatory approvals in different therapeutic categories and jurisdictions can be costly.

Early Development Services

Our Early Development Services, or EDS, offerings include a full range of services for Phase I and Phase IIa studies as well as bioanalytical analysis. We have conducted studies for major pharmaceutical companies in Europe, the United States and Japan, as well as for many smaller and emerging biotechnology companies. We have also built direct relationships with a large base of available subjects, including healthy volunteers and patient populations with specific medical conditions.

Acquisitions in recent years have allowed us to significantly expand our Phase I to Phase II services. This includes offerings focused on the conduct and design of early stage patient population studies, and therapeutically focused in human abuse liability, or HAL, addiction, pain, psychiatric, neurological, pediatric and infectious disease services. We are one of the largest providers of patient population for Phase I and confined Phase II to Phase III services in the United States, and are one of only a few CROs in the world that has the ability to design and conduct HAL studies, a regulatory‑required study for central nervous system compounds. We believe this enables us to provide our clients with a full range of Phase I to Phase II clinical research services in specialized patient populations for both inpatient and outpatient settings.

EDS also supports a variety of additional services, ranging from protocol development to data management and pharmacy services, including manufacturing of investigational medicinal products. Our state‑of‑the‑art laboratories provide pharmacokinetics, the branch of pharmacology concerned with the movement of drugs within the body, and pharmacodynamics, the branch of pharmacology concerned with the effects of drugs and the mechanism of their action analyses, including biomarkers, as needed. Our safety laboratory supports our own clinics and also acts as a central lab for medium sized Phase II trials. We also provide clinical study reports, statistical analysis, medical writing and regulatory support.

We focus on high‑end Phase I studies and specialize in more complex types of studies in which safety, intelligent design, and a wide range of pharmacodynamics assessments are critical factors. We believe our Phase I team is a leader in new developments, such as microdosing studies, pain models, HAL studies and multi‑purpose protocols with adaptive designs. We have developed extensive methodologies enabling us to conduct studies with pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics objectives.

We have more than 1,200 early development specialists working in five clinical pharmacology units located across four different countries, including the United States, the Netherlands and countries in Central and Eastern Europe. We are equipped with the technologies and infrastructure for high‑quality, efficient studies on a wide range of drugs and indications. Over the past five years, we have conducted more than 700 high‑level, complex early development clinical trials and more than 250 bioanalytical studies per year over the previous five years.

Phase I through IIa Studies—For in‑house Phase I studies, we offer more than 420 beds worldwide and accommodate volunteers in our state‑of‑the‑art clinical pharmacology units, some of which are hospital-based. At these centers, volunteers are under constant medical supervision by a team of highly experienced medical professionals. We have a pool of more than 100,000 study participants (both healthy volunteers and various specific patient populations).
In addition to in‑house studies, we use an innovative “unit‑on‑demand” business model that brings a Phase I center to patients. This model establishes a Phase I study environment in central medical facilities that specialize in the treatment of the target patient population. Physicians can recruit high volumes of patients using extensive networks of referring specialists and general practitioners. The studies occur in single center and multi‑national settings. We have also built an extensive patient network and database in areas including depression, schizophrenia, diabetes and hepatitis C. In addition to conducting Phase I and IIa studies in subjects, these sites act as investigative sites in Phase IIb and III trials.

We also offer full pharmacy capabilities and we operate a manufacturing site that complies with applicable current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and is designed for fast and flexible manufacturing of small batches of investigational medicinal product for studies. In addition, dedicated data management professionals who can process clinical data into specific deliverables are integrated in each clinical pharmacology unit.

Since a large proportion of drug compounds do not succeed in Phase I, we utilize IND trials that include “microdose” or “low‑dose” studies to screen multiple candidates at an early stage and minimize the number of failing clinical product candidates. We have been closely involved in the field of microdose studies over the past ten years and have conducted more than 30 microdose studies.

Bioanalytical Laboratory—We offer clients two state‑of‑the‑art bioanalytical laboratories located in Assen, the Netherlands, and Lenexa, Kansas, United States. These bioanalytical laboratories have been harmonized with respect to standard operating procedures, work instructions and equipment. This provides a high level of consistency, continuity and efficiency. It also provides our clients with the ability to run studies in either laboratory, depending on the requirements of the study, and ensures that they will receive the same high level of service. Both bioanalytical laboratories are located within close proximity to their respective Phase I clinical pharmacology unit, ensuring rapid sample processing for critical dose escalation decision making involving pharmacokinetic assays. Both facilities include laboratories for mass spectrometry and ultra‑ performance liquid chromatography, typically applied to small molecule analysis. For large molecules, such as biologicals and biomarkers, our laboratories operate a wide variety of specialized assays, including ligand binding assays with a variety of detection methodologies and immunogenicity. In our fully licensed isotope laboratory, bioanalytical support is provided for mass balance and microdosing studies. The laboratories, combined with expert and highly educated staff, provide a full range of analytical services throughout the development process.
Data Solutions
Our Data Solutions segment provides data, analytics, technology, and consulting solutions to the life sciences market. We have proprietary sources of data about pharmaceutical transactions that we purchase from pharmaceutical retailers, prescribers, payers and institutional users. The data is anonymized and includes details on the patient, the location where they purchased the drug or therapy, and the payer. The details on the patient, although anonymous, are tracked in such a way as to allow analysis of therapies and purchasing over a long term. They also include demographic data such as age, gender, race and diagnoses. The data is refreshed monthly.
The core service offerings of our Data Solutions segment include:

Clients and Suppliers

We serve a wide range of client types, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. We have developed numerous strategic relationships in the last five years. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we derived 48% of our revenue from large pharmaceutical companies, 16% of our revenue from small‑ to mid‑sized pharmaceutical companies, 18% of our revenue from large biotechnology companies, 17% of our revenue from all other biotechnology companies and 1% of our revenue from non-pharmaceutical companies. In 2018 our top five clients represented approximately 36% of revenue; this revenue was derived from a combination of fixed‑fee contracts, fee‑for‑service contracts and time and materials contracts. No individual client or project accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.

We utilize a number of suppliers in our business, including data suppliers, central laboratory services, drug storage and shipping, foreign language translation services and information technology. In 2018, our largest individual supplier was paid $23.3 million. In addition, our top 10 suppliers together received payments during 2018 of approximately $137.1 million. We believe that we will continue to be able to meet our current and future supply needs.

Sales and Marketing

We have a proven sales team with the ability to build relationships with new clients and to grow within existing clients. Critical to our sales process is the involvement of our operations and global scientific and medical affairs teams who contribute their knowledge to project implementation strategies presented in client proposals. These teams also work closely with the sales team to build long‑term relationships with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Our therapeutic expertise team supports the sales effort by developing robust service offerings in its core therapeutic areas, which link our organization to key clinical opinion leaders, global investigator networks and best‑in‑class vendors. We rely heavily on our past project performance, qualified teams, medical informatics data and therapeutic expertise in winning new business.

Our approach to proposal development, led by seasoned proposal developers in conjunction with insight from our drug development experts, allows us to submit proposals that address client requirements in a creative and tailored manner. Proposal teams conduct research on competing drugs and conduct feasibility studies among potential investigators to assess their interest and patient availability for proposals and presentations. Our proprietary, automated estimation system allows for rapid and accurate creation of project budgets, which forms the initial basis for business management of budgets subsequent to award of the study.

Competition

Our Clinical Research business competes primarily with other full‑service CROs and in‑house research and development departments of pharmaceutical and established biotech companies. Our principal traditional CRO competitors are ICON plc, IQVIA Holdings Inc., Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, PAREXEL International Corporation, Pharmaceutical Product Development LLC, and Syneos Health, Inc.

CROs compete on the basis of a number of factors, including reliability, past performance, expertise and experience in specific therapeutic areas, scope of service offerings, strengths in various geographic markets, technological capabilities, ability to manage large scale global clinical trials, and price.

The CRO industry remains highly fragmented, with several hundred smaller, limited service providers and a small number of full‑service companies with global capabilities. We believe there are significant barriers to becoming a global provider offering a broad range of services and products. These barriers include:

• | the cost and experience necessary to develop broad therapeutic expertise;


• | the ability to manage large, complex international clinical programs;


• | the ability to deliver high‑quality services consistently for large drug development projects;


• | the experience to prepare regulatory submissions on a global basis; and


• | the infrastructure and knowledge to respond to the global needs of clients.


Our Data Solutions business competes with a diverse set of businesses. We generally compete with other information, analytics, technology, services and consulting companies, as well as with government agencies, private payers and other healthcare companies that provide their data directly to others. Our offerings compete with a number of firms, including IQVIA Inc., OptumHealth, Cognizant Technology Solutions, and ZS Associates. 
Backlog

Our studies and projects are performed over varying durations, ranging from several months to several years. Backlog represents anticipated service revenue from contracted new business awards that either have not started or are in process but have not been completed for our Clinical Research segment. Canceled contracts and scope reductions are removed from backlog as they occur. Our backlog at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $4.2 billion, $3.5 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. Cancellations totaled $378.8 million, $366.0 million and $290.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

We believe our backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons. First, studies vary in duration. For instance, some studies that are included in our backlog may be completed in 2019, while others may be completed in later years. Second, the scope of studies may change, which may either increase or decrease the amount of backlog. Third, studies may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities. Delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue, modify or cancel the study is made.
We had $2,644.8 million, $2,413.7 million and $2,076.5 million in net new business awards for our Clinical Research segment in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Net new business represents gross new business awards less cancellations for the period.
We exclude our Data Solutions segment from backlog and new business awards due to the short term nature of its contracts.
For more details regarding risks related to our backlog, see “Risk Factors—Our backlog may not convert to service revenue at the historical conversion rate.”

Intellectual Property

We develop and use proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies and other intellectual property throughout our business, including a number of patents as well as other proprietary information regarding our methodologies, technologies, systems and analytics. We rely upon a combination of legal, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect our proprietary and confidential information and trade secrets, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights. We also hold various federal trademark registrations and pending applications in the United States and other jurisdictions, including PRA Health Sciences, Nextrials, Parallel 6, and Symphony Health. Trademarks and service marks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and so long as they have not been found to have become generic. The technology and other intellectual property rights owned and licensed by us are important to our business, although our management believes that our business, as a whole, is not dependent upon any one intellectual property or group of such properties. 
Government Regulation

In the United States, the FDA governs the conduct of clinical trials of drug products in human subjects, the form and content of regulatory applications, including, but not limited to, IND applications for human clinical testing, and the development, approval, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, and marketing of drug products. The FDA has similar authority and similar requirements with respect to the clinical testing of biological products and medical devices. In the European Union, or EU, similar laws and regulations apply which may vary slightly from one member state to another and are enforced by the European Medicines Agency or respective national member states’ authorities, depending on the case.
 Governmental regulation directly affects our business. Increased regulation leads to more complex clinical trials and an increase in potential business for us. Conversely, a relaxation in the scope of regulatory requirements, such as the introduction of simplified marketing applications for pharmaceutical and biological products, could decrease the business opportunities available to us.

We must perform our clinical drug and biologic services in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including “Good Clinical Practices,” or GCP, which govern, among other things, the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials. Before a human clinical trial may begin, the manufacturer or sponsor of the clinical product candidate must file an IND with the FDA, which contains, among other things, the results of preclinical tests, manufacturer information, and other analytical data. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Each clinical trial must be conducted in accordance with an effective IND. In addition, under GCP, each human clinical trial we conduct is subject to the oversight of an independent institutional review board, or IRB, which is an independent committee that has the regulatory authority to review, approve and monitor a clinical trial. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. In the EU, we must perform our clinical drug services in compliance with similar laws and regulations.

In order to comply with GCP and other regulations, we must, among other things:

• | comply with specific requirements governing the selection of qualified investigators;


• | obtain specific written commitments from the investigators;


• | obtain IRB review and approval of the clinical trial;


• | verify that appropriate patient informed consent is obtained before the patient participates in a clinical trial;


• | ensure adverse drug reactions resulting from the administration of a drug or biologic during a clinical trial are medically evaluated and reported in a timely manner;


• | monitor the validity and accuracy of data;


• | verify drug or biologic accountability;


• | instruct investigators and study staff to maintain records and reports; and


• | permit appropriate governmental authorities access to data for review.


We must also maintain reports in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements for each study for auditing by the client and regulatory authorities.

A failure to comply with applicable regulations relating to the conduct of clinical trials or the preparation of marketing applications could lead to a variety of sanctions. For example, violations of GCP could result, depending on the nature of the violation and the type of product involved, in the issuance of a warning letter, suspension or termination of a clinical study, refusal of the FDA to approve clinical trial or marketing applications or withdrawal of such applications, injunction, seizure of investigational products, civil penalties, criminal prosecutions, or debarment from assisting in the submission of new drug applications.

We monitor our clinical trials to test for compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the United States and the non‑U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. We have adopted standard operating procedures that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements and serve as a mechanism for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials. In the United States, our procedures were developed to ensure compliance with GCP and associated guidelines. Within Europe, all work is carried out in accordance with the Guideline for Good Clinical Practice ICH E6 (R2) adopted by the European Medicines Agency as EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/95. In order to facilitate global clinical trials, we have implemented common standard operating procedures across our regions to assure consistency whenever feasible.

The Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, or the Privacy Rule, and the Security Rule, issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH, Act of 2009, collectively HIPAA, as well as applicable state privacy and security laws and regulations, restrict the use and disclosure of certain protected health information, or PHI, and establish standards to protect individuals’ electronic PHI that is created, received, used or maintained by certain entities. Under the Privacy Rule, “covered entities” may not use or disclose PHI without the authorization of the individual who is the subject of the PHI, unless such use or disclosure is specifically permitted by the Privacy Rule or required by law.

We are not a covered entity under HIPAA. However, in connection with our clinical development activities, we do receive PHI from covered entities subject to HIPAA. In order for those covered entities to disclose PHI to us, the covered entity must obtain an authorization from the research subject that meets the Privacy Rule requirements, or make such disclosure pursuant to an exception to the Privacy Rule’s authorization requirement. We are both directly and indirectly affected by the privacy provisions surrounding individual authorizations because many investigators with whom we are involved in clinical trials are directly subject to them as a HIPAA “covered entity” and because we obtain identifiable health information from third parties that are subject to such regulations. Because of amendments to the HIPAA data security and privacy rules, there are some instances where we may be a HIPAA “business associate” of a “covered entity,” meaning that we may be directly liable for any breaches in PHI and other HIPAA violations. As part of our research activities, we require covered entities that perform research activities on our behalf to comply with HIPAA, including the Privacy Rule’s authorization requirement, and applicable state privacy and security laws and regulations.

In Europe, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or the EU GDPR, requires organizations working with the personal data of EU citizens to have established processes related to its collection and use. Organizations must have objective evidence of compliance (Principle of Accountability) with the EU GDPR. The penalties for non-compliance are significant, including up to four percent of an organization's global annual revenue. There are also administrative penalties where transfers of personal data may be stopped. As PRA is a global organization, such a disruption in data transfers could pose significant operational challenges. 
We maintain applicable registrations with the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, that enable us to use controlled substances in connection with our research services. Controlled substances are those drugs and drug products that appear on one of five schedules promulgated and administered by DEA under the Controlled Substances Act. This act governs, among other things, the distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security, and disposal of controlled substances. Our DEA registrations authorize us to receive, conduct testing on, and distribute controlled substances in Schedules II through V. A failure to comply with the DEA’s regulations governing these activities could lead to a variety of sanctions, including the revocation or the denial of a renewal of our DEA registration, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.

Environmental Regulation and Liability

We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety in the countries in which we do business, including laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. Our operations include the use, generation, and disposal of hazardous materials and medical wastes. We may, in the future, incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations for contamination of sites we own or operate (including contamination caused by prior owners or operators of such sites), the off‑site disposal of hazardous substances and for personal injuries or property damage arising from exposure to hazardous materials from our operations. We believe that we have been and are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and that we currently have no liabilities under such environmental requirements that could reasonably be expected to materially harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Liability and Insurance

We may be liable to our clients for any failure to conduct their studies properly according to the agreed‑upon protocol and contract. If we fail to conduct a study properly in accordance with the agreed‑upon procedures, we may have to repeat a study or a particular portion of the services at our expense, reimburse the client for the cost of the services and/or pay additional damages.

At our clinical pharmacology units, we study the effects of drugs on healthy volunteers. In addition, in our clinical business we, on behalf of our clients, contract with physicians who render professional services, including the administration of the substance being tested, to participants in clinical trials, many of whom are seriously ill and are at great risk of further illness or death as a result of factors other than their participation in a trial. As a result, we could be held liable for bodily injury, death, pain and suffering, loss of consortium, or other personal injury claims and medical expenses arising from a clinical trial. In addition, we sometimes engage the services of vendors necessary for the conduct of a clinical trial, such as laboratories or medical diagnostic specialists. Because these vendors are engaged as subcontractors, we are responsible for their performance and may be held liable for damages if the subcontractors fail to perform in the manner specified in their contract.

To reduce our potential liability, and as a requirement of the GCP regulations, informed consent is required from each volunteer and patient. In addition, our clients provide us with contractual indemnification for all of our service related contracts. These indemnities generally do not, however, protect us against certain of our own actions such as those involving negligence or misconduct. Our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed if we were required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with a claim that is not indemnified, that is outside the scope of an indemnity or where the indemnity, although applicable, is not honored in accordance with its terms.

We maintain errors, omissions, and professional liability insurance in amounts we believe to be appropriate. This insurance provides coverage for vicarious liability due to negligence of the investigators who contract with us, as well as claims by our clients that a clinical trial was compromised due to an error or omission by us. If our insurance coverage is not adequate, or if insurance coverage does not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially harmed.

Seasonality
Although our business is not generally seasonal, our Clinical Research segment typically experiences a slight decrease in its revenue growth rate during the fourth quarter due to holiday vacations and a similar decrease in new business awards in the first quarter due to our clients’ budgetary cycles and vacations during the year‑end holiday period. Our Data Solutions segment usually experiences an increase in revenue during the fourth quarter as many pharmaceutical companies use a portion of funds remaining in their annual budgets to purchase its data offerings.
Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had over 16,400 employees, of which approximately 43% were in the United States, approximately 34% were in Europe, approximately 3% were in Canada, and approximately 20% were in Africa, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. Some of our employees located outside of the United States are represented by workers council or labor unions. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory. Approximately 40% of employees hold a Master’s level degree or higher. We have approximately 1,800 employees that hold a Ph.D, M.D. or other doctorate level degrees.
