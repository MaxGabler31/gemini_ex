Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of liver and cardio-metabolic diseases. Our lead product candidate, pegozafermin (previously BIO89-100), a specifically engineered glycoPEGylated analog of fibroblast growth factor 21 (“FGF21”), is currently being developed for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) and for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia (“SHTG”). NASH is a severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”), characterized by inflammation and fibrosis in the liver that can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”) and death. There are currently no approved products for the treatment of NASH. In January 2022, we announced positive topline results from an expansion cohort (cohort 7) of the Phase 1b/2a trial of pegozafermin in NASH after announcing positive topline data from cohorts 1 through 6 in September 2020. We also initiated a Phase 2b trial (ENLIVEN) evaluating pegozafermin in fibrosis stage 2 or 3 NASH patients in June 2021. Patients will receive weekly doses or a every two-week dose of pegozafermin or placebo for 24 weeks followed by a blinded extension phase of an additional 24 weeks for a total treatment period of 48 weeks. We are making good progress in ENLIVEN and expect to report topline data from this trial in the first half of 2023. Based on learnings from our recent cohort, developments in the field, and feedback from our steering committee, we are working on steps to optimize the ENLIVEN trial. In 2021, we completed a pharmacokinetic study of pegozafermin in NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis (fibrosis stage F4) demonstrating that pegozafermin 30 mg has similar single-dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in F4 as it does in non-cirrhotic NASH. We are currently evaluating the potential opportunity for pegozafermin in these fibrosis stage F4 patients. SHTG is a condition identified by severely elevated levels of triglycerides (≥500 mg/dL), which is associated with an increased risk of NASH, cardiovascular events and acute pancreatitis. We initiated our Phase 2 trial (ENTRIGUE) in SHTG patients in the third quarter of 2020 and expect to report topline data in the second quarter of 2022. We closed enrollment in this trial in February 2022 with 85 patients enrolled.
 FGF21 is a metabolic hormone that regulates energy expenditure and glucose and lipid metabolism. FGF21 analogs represent a promising class of drugs to treat NASH, because they not only address the liver manifestations, but also have an effect on the multiple co-morbidities that worsen NASH. FGF21 is a clinically validated mechanism that has been shown in humans to reduce steatosis, improve the histological features of NASH and address cardio-metabolic dysregulation. It is thought to exert effects on liver fibrosis by improving metabolic regulation, which reduces ongoing liver injury thus giving the liver time to heal. FGF21 also generates an on-target effect to increase adiponectin, a hormone released from adipose tissue that, among other functions, can suppress development and progression of hepatic fibrosis. However, FGF21 in its native form suffers from a short half-life and a tendency to aggregate in solution, both of which impact its suitability as a viable drug. To address these challenges, we have specifically engineered pegozafermin to extend the half-life of the molecule while maintaining potency and thereby the clinical benefits of FGF21.
 Pegozafermin may be a differentiated FGF21 therapy based on its robust and durable biological effects, a favorable tolerability profile and its potential for every two-week dosing. Given its ability to address the key liver pathologies in NASH, as well as the underlying metabolic dysregulation in NASH patients, pegozafermin has the potential to become a backbone of treatment in NASH. Pegozafermin is the only FGF21 analog being developed for the treatment of SHTG and its broad metabolic effects could potentially differentiate it from competitors in this market. Pegozafermin has a long half-life which allows convenient weekly or every-two-week dosing and is currently the only FGF21 analog being tested for every-two-week dosing. The convenient dosing regimen may support adoption and compliance amongst patients living with these chronic and generally asymptomatic diseases. Pegozafermin is self-administered by patents subcutaneously in a liquid formulation.
 In September 2020 and January 2022, we presented positive topline results from cohorts 1 through 6 and cohort 7 respectively in our Phase 1b/2a trial in NASH patients which has informed the advancement of our clinical 
 5


strategy in NASH. The 13-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose-ranging portion of the trial enrolled a total of 81 patients in cohorts 1 through 6 with biopsy-confirmed NASH and phenotypic NASH (“PNASH”). All dose groups demonstrated statistically significant reductions in liver fat at week 13, with relative reduction of up to 60% versus baseline, and up to 70% versus placebo, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging—proton density fat factor (“MRI-PDFF”). A majority of patients achieved a greater than or equal to 30% (up to 88%) or a greater than or equal to 50% (up to 71%) reduction in liver fat from baseline. ALT, a liver enzyme, was significantly reduced (up to 44%) in these patients and key lipid markers like triglycerides, LDL, and non-HDL were also significantly improved. Cohort 7 in the Phase 1b/2a trial was a single-arm cohort that enrolled 20 patients with biopsy-confirmed fibrosis stage F2 and F3 NASH who were treated once weekly for 20 weeks with 27 mg of pegozafermin. Cohort 7 data was consistent with previous findings and validate pegozafermin’s effect on histology. Meaningful changes were observed on key histology endpoints with a greater than or equal to 2-point improvement in NAS and no worsening of fibrosis, NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis, and improvement in at least one stage of fibrosis without worsening NAS. Clinically meaningful and significant changes were observed across key non-invasive tests (NITs) associated with fibrosis, risk of fibrosis, or NASH resolution suggesting pegozafermin is improving total liver health. In addition to significant improvement in liver health, treatment with pegozafermin also had significant positive effects on glycemic control, lipids, adiponectin, and body weight. In 83 patients treated with pegozafermin across the full Phase 1b/2a study in cohorts 1 through 7, pegozafermin was generally well tolerated with a favorable safety profile. There were no drug-related serious adverse events and only one treatment-related discontinuation. Pooled pegozafermin treatment related adverse events in greater than or equal to 10% of patients were increased appetite (13% vs 0% placebo), diarrhea (13% vs 11% placebo), and nausea (12% vs 11% placebo). Most of the GI adverse events were mild and of short duration. A few mild injection site reactions were reported and there were no tremors and no hypersensitivity adverse events observed. Pegozafermin had no adverse effects on blood pressure or heart rate.
 Given the potential of FGF21 to meaningfully reduce triglycerides and provide other metabolic benefits, and the established regulatory path for approval, we are developing pegozafermin for the treatment of SHTG. We initiated our Phase 2 trial (ENTRIGUE) in SHTG patients in the third quarter of 2020 and have closed enrollment with 85 patients either on stable background treatment with statins and/or prescription fish oil and/or fibrates or not on any background therapy. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients receive pegozafermin administered weekly (9 mg, 18 mg or 27 mg) or every two weeks (36 mg) or placebo over an eight-week treatment period. The primary endpoint is the percentage change in fasting triglyceride levels from baseline. Key secondary endpoints include other lipid and metabolic markers and a sub-study evaluating change in liver fat measured by MRI-PDFF. Screening in the fibrate cohort was stopped with the main study and will be analyzed as part of main ENTRIGUE trial. Topline data from ENTRIGUE is expected in the second quarter of 2022.
 Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business and delay our development timeline. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our future operating results and financial condition is uncertain. We initiated our Phase 2 trial (ENTRIGUE) in SHTG patients in the third quarter of 2020 and our Phase 2b trial in NASH patients in the middle of 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted execution and enrollment of these trials. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays that may affect our clinical trials, which could prevent or delay us from obtaining approval for pegozafermin. Given the surges in cases of COVID-19 experienced previously and uncertainty regarding other variants, we cannot predict how our ongoing trials may be impacted. For more information regarding risks related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, please see the risk factor entitled “The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted and may in the future result in significant disruptions to our clinical trials or other business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,” in Part I. Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth under “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Strategy
 Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of liver and cardio-metabolic diseases. The key components of our strategy are to:

• | Rapidly advance pegozafermin through clinical development for the treatment of NASH. We believe pegozafermin may be a differentiated FGF21 therapy based on its robust and durable biological effects, a favorable tolerability profile and its potential for every two-week dosing. We reported positive topline results in September 2020 and January 2022 from our Phase 1b/2a trial in NASH patients and have initiated a Phase 2b trial (ENLIVEN) in NASH patients with F2 and F3 fibrosis that is expected to report topline data in the first half of 2023. We are also evaluating the potential opportunity for pegozafermin in NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue SHTG as a second indication with pegozafermin given its unique profile and its potential for a quicker path to market. Pegozafermin’s mechanism of action supports its potential to become a differentiated treatment for SHTG patients with other metabolic co-morbidities. We expect to report topline data from the Phase 2 ENTRIGUE trial in the second quarter of 2022. We believe that a combination of smaller clinical trials and shorter development timelines could mean that SHTG potentially represents a quicker path to market for pegozafermin.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scale-up and optimize the manufacturing of pegozafermin. We currently use an external contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”) to manufacture pegozafermin for our ongoing and planned clinical trials. While these trials are ongoing, we plan to work with our CMO to optimize and scale-up the manufacturing process for pegozafermin to support the increased production that will be needed for later-stage clinical trials and commercialization, if pegozafermin is approved.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish a commercial infrastructure in key geographies. We have worldwide rights to pegozafermin and intend to develop the sales infrastructure required for commercialization in the United States. We also plan to evaluate options, including strategic collaborations, for commercializing pegozafermin, if approved, in other key markets, such as Europe and China.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build a diversified multi-asset pipeline of novel therapies. We intend to employ a value-driven strategy to identify, acquire, develop and commercialize product candidates for liver and cardio-metabolic diseases. We intend to focus on product candidates that we believe have attractive profiles and address a clear unmet medical need and can advance quickly and efficiently into late-stage development.

 Our Focus on Liver and Cardio-Metabolic Disease
 We are focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic interventions that have a clinically meaningful impact on patients with liver and cardio-metabolic diseases. These diseases, including NASH and SHTG, represent leading global causes of morbidity and mortality. Despite a wave of public health campaigns to promote better diet and exercise habits and a range of treatment options available for many of these diseases, there is a significant unmet medical need for more effective therapies to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden on global healthcare systems.
 We are currently developing our lead product candidate, pegozafermin, a specifically engineered glycoPEGylated analog of FGF21, for the treatment of NASH and SHTG. We believe pegozafermin is an ideal candidate for the treatment of NASH based on its ability to address the key liver pathologies in NASH, its ability to address the underlying metabolic dysregulation in NASH patients, its favorable tolerability profile, and its potential for a longer dosing interval. Multiple epidemiological studies have linked NAFLD to increased cardiovascular disease, concluding that the majority of deaths among NAFLD patients are attributable to cardiovascular disease. As a result, we believe it is important that new therapeutics options for NASH address the underlying cardiovascular and metabolic dysregulations in these patients.
 Given the potential of pegozafermin to meaningfully reduce triglycerides, we are also developing pegozafermin for the treatment of SHTG. Pegozafermin may have a competitive differentiation from approved therapies and other molecules in development based on its impact on improving liver fat and other metabolic 
 7


markers in addition to triglyceride reduction. There is regulatory precedence for the approval of therapies for the treatment of SHTG in the United States based on the percent reduction in triglycerides from baseline as the primary endpoint for full approval. Based on the regulatory path followed by other companies that have successfully developed SHTG therapies, we believe that a combination of smaller clinical trials and shorter development timelines could mean that SHTG potentially represents a quicker path to market for pegozafermin.
Disease Overview - NASH
 NASH, a severe form of NAFLD, is characterized histologically by the additional presence of inflammation and hepatocellular injury such as visible ballooning and has a significantly worse prognosis, with the potential to progress to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis or HCC. 
 NASH represents a large and rapidly growing problem in the United States and worldwide. Diagnoses have been on the rise and are expected to increase dramatically in the next decade. The prevalence of NAFLD, which affects approximately 25% of the global population, and NASH, which develops in approximately 20% to 25% of NAFLD patients, is driven primarily by the worldwide obesity epidemic. As a result, the prevalence of NASH has increased significantly in recent decades, paralleling similar trends in the prevalence of obesity, insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of these conditions is expected to increase further in view of the unhealthy nutrition habits, such as consumption of a diet high in fructose, sucrose and saturated fats, and sedentary behavior that characterize modern lifestyle. 
 The critical pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the development and progression of NASH include reduced ability to handle lipids, increased insulin resistance, injury to hepatocytes and liver fibrosis in response to hepatocyte injury. NASH patients have an excessive accumulation of fat in the liver resulting primarily from a caloric intake above and beyond energy needs. A healthy liver contains less than 5% fat, but a liver in someone with NASH can contain more than 20% fat. This abnormal liver fat contributes to the progression to NASH, a liver necro-inflammatory state, that can lead to scarring, also known as fibrosis, and, for some, can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure—cirrhosis develops in approximately 20% to 45% of patients. In some cases, cirrhosis progresses to decompensated cirrhosis, which results in permanent liver damage that can lead to liver failure. In addition, it is estimated that 8% of patients with advanced fibrosis will develop HCC. NASH is a complex, multifaceted disease that doesn’t just affect the liver. Patients with NASH frequently have other significant metabolic co-morbidities such as obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and systemic hypertension (a constellation of which is commonly referred to as metabolic syndrome) and these further contribute to the risk of cardiovascular disease. 
 Disease Overview - SHTG
 We are also developing pegozafermin for the treatment of SHTG. Hypertriglyceridemia (“HTG”) is characterized by elevated fasting plasma triglyceride levels >200 mg/dL and SHTG is typically defined as triglyceride levels of ≥500 mg/dL. SHTG is associated with an increased risk of NAFLD, NASH and cardiovascular diseases, as well as acute pancreatitis, accounting for up to 10% of all acute pancreatitis episodes. A third-party study utilizing an omega-3 fatty acid (“omega-3 FA”) demonstrated the linkage between a reduction in triglycerides and favorable cardiovascular clinical outcomes. Additionally, SHTG increases the risk of developing NAFLD, NASH and cardiovascular disease. 
 It is estimated that there are 4 million patients in the United States with triglyceride levels of ≥500 mg/dL. Of these patients, it is estimated that up to 100% of patients have clinically meaningful hepatic fat (MRI-PDFF ≥5%; baseline data from the sub-study in ENTRIGUE; n=14), up to 70% have Type 2 diabetes, and up to 65% have high LDL. This patient population is expected to increase due to the triple epidemic of obesity, metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes. In addition, the addressable market has the potential to expand as a result of increasing awareness of the importance of treating elevated triglyceride levels, similar to the focus today of physicians on managing LDL levels, as well as due to third party commercial efforts expected to promote triglyceride reduction. 
 The treatment regimen for SHTG includes dietary restrictions and lipid-lowering drug treatment such as fibrates, omega-3 fish oils and niacin. Some statins are indicated in HTG but do not have an indication for use in SHTG. Despite multiple agents approved for the treatment of SHTG, these agents have limitations that may not make them ideal for all patients. For example, fibrates have demonstrated reductions in triglycerides of up to 
 8


approximately 55% at 12 weeks of treatment. However, they have also shown increases in LDL-C (up to 45%), a detrimental effect in this patient population, risk of drug-drug interactions and increases in transaminases, as well as tolerability issues including myopathy. Omega 3 fish oils have shown more modest benefits in reduction of triglycerides from baseline of approximately 25% to 45%. Some fish oils have also showed major increases in LDL-C (up to 45%). Fish oils also have a significant pill burden given the high daily doses required. In addition, these agents fail to meaningfully address the related co-morbidities of SHTG, including liver fat reduction and glycemic control, which, when left untreated, may further exacerbate the condition. In third-party studies, up to 50% of treated SHTG patients were unable to reduce their triglyceride levels to < 500 mg/dL despite using approved drugs and are considered refractory patients. These refractory patients have substantial unmet medical need and represent a significant market opportunity for pegozafermin as an add-on therapy along with the opportunity for pegozafermin to be used in patients not on any background therapy. Given the continuing unmet need in SHTG and limitations of current treatments, there are several agents in development for the treatment of SHTG, including a fibrate, and novel drugs targeting aspects of HTG and SHTG, including ANGPTL3 and APOC3 inhibitors. 
 Etiology of NASH
 Understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to NASH has evolved in recent years. Excessive caloric overload, metabolic dysregulation, cardio-metabolic co-morbidities and genetic risk factors increase the likelihood of developing NASH, with a multitude of potential mechanistic contributors to pathophysiology. In NASH, the liver’s capacity to handle the primary metabolic energy substrates, carbohydrates and fatty acids, is overwhelmed. This occurs when there is an excess of free fatty acids deposited in the liver or their disposal from the liver is impaired. The accumulation of surplus free fatty acids leads to the formation of toxic lipid species. These toxic lipids then induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress and an inflammatory response, which can result in hepatocellular injury and death. This may lead to fibrosis and genomic instability, which may worsen over time to cirrhosis and HCC, respectively.
 The critical pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying development and progression of NASH include (1) reduced ability to handle lipids, (2) increased insulin resistance, (3) injury to hepatocytes and (4) development and progression of liver fibrosis in response to hepatocyte injury.
 
Reduced Ability to Handle Lipids
 Excess consumption of calories, poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle, each often associated with obesity, can burden the body with a surplus of carbohydrates and lipids. This burden can be progressively more difficult for the liver to handle thereby resulting in steatosis in the liver. The problem is compounded further as insulin resistance develops.
 Free fatty acids (“FFA”) accumulate in the liver primarily from three sources, namely, through (1) the transfer from peripheral adipose tissues where triglycerides are mobilized, (2) de-novo lipogenesis (“DNL”), and (3) direct dietary intake. The FFA that lead to NASH are believed to arise primarily from the peripheral tissue pool and secondarily through DNL. The increase in the influx of FFA to the liver from the peripheral tissues is driven by excessive caloric intake greater than the body’s demand and increased insulin resistance resulting in deposition of fat to the liver for processing. DNL is a distinct process in the liver by which hepatocytes convert excess carbohydrates, especially fructose, to fatty acids.
 The three main fates of fatty acids in the liver are (1) mitochondrial beta-oxidation (to release ATP, or energy), (2) re-esterification to form triglyceride, which can then be exported into the blood as very low density lipoproteins, or (3) stored in lipid droplets, resulting in liver steatosis and ultimately NASH. Adiponectin, a hormone derived from adipose tissue, appears to have a pivotal role in improving fatty acid oxidation and decreasing fatty acid synthesis, components of lipid handling.
 An increase in cholesterol accumulation in the liver can also contribute to NASH, though its role is not as clearly defined as in the case of triglycerides. The dysregulation of the cholesterol pathway can result in an increase in the cholesterol levels in the liver. The increased cholesterol can accumulate in the liver cell membranes and 
 9


activate Kupffer cells (activated stellate macrophages), thereby triggering inflammatory pathways and resulting in the progression of NASH.
 Increased Insulin Resistance
 Insulin resistance, which typically develops in obese individuals, is considered to be a fundamental underlying mechanism in the majority of NASH patients. Fatty acids are primarily delivered to the liver from blood following lipolysis of triglycerides in adipose tissue, a process that is regulated by the actions of insulin on adipocytes. Insulin resistance in adipose tissue manifests as dysregulated lipolysis resulting in excessive delivery of FFA to the liver. The liver tries to cope with the large influx of FFA; however, the build-up of metabolic intermediates interferes with signaling, resulting in hepatic insulin resistance and the inability of the liver to process this excess FFA influx. The state of hepatic insulin resistance further exacerbates the problem by triggering DNL and the build-up of excess fat in the liver.
Injury to Hepatocytes
 When the disposal of fatty acids through beta-oxidation or the formation of triglycerides is chronically overwhelmed, fatty acids can form lipotoxic species that lead to stress on the endoplasmic reticulum, oxidative stress and inflammation, all of which are pivotal processes in the development of NASH. Liver inflammation may be an important link between the initial metabolic stress and subsequent hepatocyte death and stimulation of fibrogenesis in NASH by promotion of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and of apoptosis (cell death). These processes are core to the steatohepatitis that gives NASH its name. For example, hepatocyte apoptosis results in the ballooning of cells, a classic pathological feature of NASH. While hepatocytes are the primary and major target of toxic lipids, other cells such as Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells are also affected by lipotoxicity and contribute to the development of NASH pathology.
 Additional factors, including dysregulation of cytokines and adipokines, energy depletion, anti-oxidant deficiencies, products of the gut microbiome and iron load may modulate hepatocyte vulnerability to the development of lipotoxic stress, injury and inflammation.
 Development and Progression of Liver Fibrosis in Response to Hepatocyte Injury
 Signaling from stressed or injured hepatocytes and Kupffer cells leads to activation of quiescent hepatic stellate cells. Upon activation, hepatic stellate cells release collagen and other factors. When the production of collagen and matrix proteins is faster than their degradation, accumulation of these proteins in the extracellular matrix can lead to progressive fibrosis. As the lipotoxicity and inflammation continue to damage the liver, the hepatic stellate cells continue to be activated resulting in greater collagen deposition that ultimately leads to fibrosis and cirrhosis.
Diagnosis
 Most people with NASH are asymptomatic and their disease is often discovered incidentally following a liver imaging procedure, such as an ultrasound, prescribed for other reasons or as part of an investigation for elevated liver enzymes. Once suspected clinically, a liver biopsy is required to definitively diagnose NASH, which necessitates the joint presence of steatosis, ballooning and lobular inflammation. Once pathologically confirmed, the severity of NAFLD and NASH is determined using the histologically validated NAS, which grades disease activity on a scale of 0 to 8. The NAS is the sum of the individual scores for steatosis (0 to 3), lobular inflammation (0 to 3), and hepatocellular ballooning (0 to 2) but does not include a score for fibrosis. Fibrosis staging (F0-F4) relies on the Kleiner classification (F0 = no fibrosis; F1 = perisinusoidal or periportal fibrosis (not both); F2 = both perisinusoidal and periportal fibrosis; F3 = bridging fibrosis; F4 = cirrhosis).
 Histological diagnosis remains the gold standard for assessment of NASH and fibrosis. However, given that liver biopsy is associated with risks of pain, bleeding and other morbidity, as well as significant cost, the procedure is not practical for general patient screening. Additionally, histology diagnosis is confounded by evaluation of a small sliver of a large heterogenous organ that may not represent the full organ, and significant variability in reading 
 10


of slides including inter- and intra-reader variability. Several non-invasive tools such as clinical risk scores, serum markers and imaging techniques are increasingly used to assess NASH patients. Non-invasive tests (“NITs”) such as the Fibroscan-AST (“FAST”) score, Fibrosis-4 index, the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis score and vibration-controlled transient elastography, (“VCTE”), have been validated and are increasingly used. These NITs have an excellent negative predictive value and an acceptable positive predictive value for detection of advanced (≥ F3) fibrosis and are increasingly used in clinical settings. Additionally, evidence is emerging that shows a correlation between reduction in steatosis as measured by MRI-PDFF and reduction in ALT  ≥17 U/L and histologic improvement on liver biopsy. In draft guidance, the FDA encouraged sponsors to identify biochemical or noninvasive imaging biomarkers that, once characterized and agreed by the FDA, could replace liver biopsies for patient selection and efficacy assessment in clinical trials.
 We expect that the validation and subsequent adoption of these NITs will result in an increase in the diagnosis and treatment rates for NASH in the future.
 FGF21 Overview
 Fibroblast growth factors (“FGFs”), including FGF21 and FGF19, are a large family of cell-signaling proteins involved in the regulation of many processes within the body. FGF21 is an endogenous metabolic hormone that regulates energy homeostasis, glucose-lipid-protein metabolism and insulin sensitivity, and modulates the pathways that mitigate against intracellular stress. FGF21 is secreted primarily by the liver but is also secreted by the white adipose tissue (“WAT”), skeletal muscle and the pancreas. FGF21 exerts its biological benefits through the activation of three fibroblast growth factor receptors (“FGFRs”), FGFR1c, FGFR2c and FGFR3c, and requires co-activation of the transmembrane protein cofactor beta Klotho (“ß-Klotho”). FGF21 is not believed to activate FGFR4, which has been associated with adverse effects. FGF21 can act directly or indirectly on target organs by mediating downstream regulators, such as adiponectin, and upstream regulators that induce FGF21, such as nutritional stress or transcription factors. 
Biological Effects of FGF21: 
 Reducing Liver Steatosis by Improving Lipid Handling and Insulin Sensitivity
 FGF21 has been clinically shown to reduce liver steatosis. FGF21 reduces liver steatosis by (1) increasing fatty acid oxidation in the liver, (2) reducing the deposition of free fatty acids from peripheral tissue to the liver and (3) reducing DNL in the liver. FGF21 exerts its systemic effects by reducing the serum levels of lipids (e.g., triglycerides, LDL cholesterol) and increasing insulin sensitivity. Increasing insulin sensitivity reduces lipolysis and can also reduce serum levels of lipids. In particular, FGF21 has been demonstrated to reduce liver fat in patients with NASH in multiple clinical trials.
Improving Liver Inflammation and Fibrosis
 FGF21 is also believed to reduce liver fibrosis, the pathological change mostly clearly linked to liver-related morbidity in NASH patients via two potential pathways. One pathway is through the metabolic benefits of FGF21 described above. Long-term improvements in metabolic regulation reduce the ongoing liver injury that drives fibrosis and thus allows the liver time to heal. The other pathway is a direct anti-fibrotic effect mediated via adiponectin, an adipokine that is upregulated by FGF21. Increased adiponectin downregulates the hepatic stellate cells that are activated upon hepatic injury and responsible for collagen deposition and subsequent fibrosis. FGF21 demonstrated an improvement in liver fibrosis in patients in NASH in a clinical trial.
 11


FGF21 Signaling
 As noted above, FGF21 exerts its biological benefits through the co-activation of FGFRs and ß-Klotho. FGFRs are expressed widely throughout the body whereas ß-Klotho is primarily expressed in metabolic tissues such as adipose tissue, liver, and pancreas, thereby providing organ specificity to FGF21. The binding of FGF21 is a two-step process. The C-terminus of FGF21 initially binds to ß-Klotho enabling the N-terminus to form an expanded complex with one of the FGFRs. Once the co-receptor complex has formed with ß-Klotho and one of the FGFRs, a series of intracellular signaling cascades is initiated. These signaling cascades enable FGF21 to exert its biological functions.
 FGF21 activates three specific FGFRs (FGFR1c, FGFR2c and FGFR3c), which based on nonclinical studies and clinical trials, appear to be responsible for mediating the desired therapeutic actions of FGF21 in NASH. FGF21 is not believed to activate FGFR4. Activation of FGFR4 results in an increase in LDL cholesterol and has been implicated in the etiology or progression of HCC. 
 Pegozafermin
 Overview
 We are developing pegozafermin, a specifically engineered glycoPEGylated analog of FGF21, for the treatment of NASH and SHTG. Pegozafermin has been specifically engineered to retain the activity of native FGF21 while extending its half-life. Specifically, it has been engineered to: (1) protect against proteolysis and reduce renal clearance, (2) have an extended half-life, (3) minimize susceptibility to aggregate in solution and (4) optimize its potency, enabling the potential use of lower dosage/doses. Additionally, we believe that pegozafermin may enhance binding affinity for ß-Klotho, by altering the conformation of the C-terminus which could have a positive impact on efficacy.
 Primary Structure and Protein Engineering of Pegozafermin
 Pegozafermin has been optimally constructed with two mutations via substitutions with natural amino acids at site-specific positions (173 and 176) toward the C-terminus end of the hormone. The mutations were incorporated into the FGF21 sequence after existing proline to create a consensus sequence for glycosylation. Subsequently, the glycosyl linker and a single 20 kDa glycoPEG moiety were enzymatically introduced at the O-linked glycosylation consensus site (position 173) via the proprietary glycoPEGylation technology. Our glycoPEG moiety is an activated form of the PEG molecule with the use of Sialic Acid, CMP-SA-PEG. The proximity of the mutations ensures consistent and efficient attachment of the glycoPEG moiety.
 Pegozafermin has two modified natural amino acid residues:
  
• | S173T: Serine modified to Threonine at position 173; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | R176A: Arginine modified to Alanine at position 176.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 In addition, a Methionine residue was introduced at the N-terminus which acts as the translation initiation signal. Figure 1 below shows the structure of pegozafermin.

Figure 1: Structure of Pegozafermin
 

The increase in the size of the molecule from 19.4 kDa to 40 kDa together with the site-specific mutations adjacent to the primary cleavage site of FGF21 (by the FAP enzyme between positions 171 and 172 on the native amino acid chain, which would be represented by positions 172 and 173 in our molecule starting with Methionine in position 1) are designed to prolong the half-life of the molecule. Additionally, we believe that the use of glycoPEGylation technology produces a comparatively stronger and more flexible structure, which aids in the development of a stable formulation. PEGylation technology has been used successfully in many pharmaceutical products including products that have been marketed for more than 10 years.
 Pegozafermin uses a proprietary glycoPEGylation technology that has been previously validated by a third party, as this technology is incorporated in another pharmaceutical product (Lonquex® by Teva) that has received regulatory approval and is currently commercialized in the European Union.
 Figure 2: Summary of Pegozafermin Attributes and Benefits
 
 
Features | Description | Potential Benefit 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------
Use of PEG (via glycoPEGylation) | ▪ Increases protein size and hydrodynamic volume that reduces renal filtration ▪ Prevents degradation by endocytosis and proteolytic enzymes | ▪ Prolongs half-life 
▪ Protects antigenic sites present on the protein surface (i.e. antigenic epitopes) | ▪ Reduces immunogenicity 
▪ Steric repulsion between the PEGylated surfaces increases water solubility and reduces aggregates | ▪ Results in more stable formulation 
Site-Specific Mutations | ▪ Mutation at position 173 is immediately adjacent to the primary cleavage (FAP enzyme) site of FGF21 | ▪ Prolongs half-life 
GlycoPEGylation Technology | ▪ Allows site specific linkage (glycoPEG moiety to position 173) ▪ Proximity of the glycoPEG moiety to the C-terminus induces conformational changes to the molecule | ▪ Retains potency against receptor to improve efficacy 
▪ Provides a strong and flexible glycosyl bond that helps the glycoPEG moiety remain intact, further reducing degradation | ▪ Further enhances half-life

Therapeutic Potential of Pegozafermin Supported by Preclinical Animal Models of NASH, Diabetes and Obesity
 Pegozafermin has been evaluated in three animal models of direct relevance to NASH. These included: (1) Stelic Animal Model, (“STAM”), (2) Diet-induced NASH (“DIN”) model and (3) spontaneous diabetic obese cynomolgus monkey model. Additional studies done in diabetes mouse model and diet induced obesity mouse model showed benefits in key markers of relevance in NASH.
 A wide range of doses were tested in these studies as well as weekly and once every two-week dosing regimen was tested in a cynomolgus monkey study. The key outcomes of these studies are summarized in Figure 3 below.

 Pegozafermin Clinical Development in NASH
 Phase 1a Clinical Trial of Single-Dose of Pegozafermin in Healthy Volunteers
 
We conducted a Phase 1a clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of pegozafermin in 58 healthy volunteers. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1a, first-in-human, SAD clinical trial the PK profile of pegozafermin was generally dose-proportional or slightly more than dose-proportional with a half-life of approximately 55 to 100 hours. At single doses of 9.1 mg and higher, significant improvements were observed in key lipid parameters measured at Day 8 and Day 15 after dosing on Day 1. The mean changes versus baseline include significant reductions in triglycerides (up to 51%) and LDL-C (up to 37%) and increase in HDL-C (up to 36%) despite the baseline values being in the normal range. Pegozafermin demonstrated rapid (starting from Day 2), sustained and durable improvements on lipid parameters for two weeks or more after single-dose administration. Pegozafermin was well tolerated across the dose range and there were no deaths, serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events. The most commonly observed treatment-related adverse events, occurring in at least two subjects in the pooled pegozafermin group, were injection site reactions and headache, all of which were reported as mild. No clinically meaningful trends were observed in gastrointestinal events, laboratories or vital signs including blood pressure or heart rate changes. 
 Phase 1b/2a Proof of Concept Clinical Trial in NASH Patients
 In September 2020 and January 2022, we presented positive topline results from cohorts 1 to 6 and cohort 7 respectively in our Phase 1b/2a trial in NASH patients which has informed the advancement of our clinical strategy in NASH. The phase 1b/2a trial for cohorts 1 to 6 was multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose-ranging and enrolled a total of 81 patients to receive weekly (3mg/9mg/18mg/27mg) or every two-week (18mg/36mg) dosing of pegozafermin or placebo for up to 12 weeks. Key endpoints assessed were safety, tolerability, and PK of pegozafermin as well as change in liver fat measured by MRI-PDFF and other metabolic markers. The trial design is shown in Figure 4 below. 
 14


Figure 4: Phase 1b/2a Trial Design
 

As shown in Figure 5 below, all dose groups in cohorts 1 to 6 demonstrated significant reductions in liver fat at week 13, with relative reductions up to 60% versus baseline and up to 70% versus placebo, as measured by MRI-PDFF. 43% of the patients at the highest dose achieved normal liver fat content of < 5%. A significant proportion of patients responded to therapy with up to 88% and 71% of patients achieving a ≥30% or a ≥50% reduction in liver fat versus baseline, respectively.
Figure 5: Relative Reduction in Liver Fat vs. Placebo at Week 13
 


As shown in Figure 6 below for cohorts 1 to 6, treatment with pegozafermin also resulted in significant improvements in liver transaminases, with up to a 44% reduction in ALT and a 35 U/L decrease in ALT in patients with elevated baseline levels. Treatment with pegozafermin resulted in significant reductions in triglycerides (up to 28%; p <0.05), non-HDL (up to 16%; p<0.01) and LDL-C (up to 16%; p<0.05). Triglycerides were reduced to a greater extent in patients with elevated triglycerides at baseline (TG ≥200 mg/dL), and 53% of the pegozafermin patients in this group normalized triglyceride levels versus 0% in the placebo group. Pegozafermin also demonstrated significant increases in the insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin (up to 61%; p<0.001). Improvements were also noted across the spectrum of metabolic marker data vs. placebo for the 27mg QW dose group including HOMA-IR, glucose, HbA1c, and body weight (p<0.05). 
 15


Figure 6: Clinically Meaningful ALT Reduction; Greater Reduction in Patients with High ALT
 

Additional analyses presented at the Endocrine Society’s annual meeting in March 2021 demonstrated that pegozafermin treatment resulted in significant reductions in liver volume of up to 15% and liver fat volume of up to 65% in treated patients at 13 weeks compared to baseline, as measured by MRI-PDFF. A post-hoc analysis presented at The Liver Meeting of AASLD in November 2021 assessed the effect of pegozafermin on spleen volume (SV) in NASH patients without advanced fibrosis. SV was evaluated by MRI in all eligible patients on pegozafermin 27mg every week dose (n=8), pegozafermin 36mg every two-week dose (n=8) and 16 patients on placebo. At baseline, it was observed that SV was correlated with liver volume, vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) score and body mass index (BMI), and negatively correlated with platelet count. Findings at study Day 50 and Day 92 demonstrated that treatment with pegozafermin led to a progressive and significant decrease in SV compared to placebo (on Day 50, treated patients saw an average 7.4% decrease in SV and by Day 92 patients saw an average 11.8% decrease in SV).
Paired-biopsy, Open-label Histology Cohort (Cohort 7)
 Cohort 7 in the Phase 1b/2a trial was a single-arm cohort that enrolled 20 patients with biopsy-confirmed fibrosis stage F2 and F3 NASH who were treated once weekly for 20 weeks with 27 mg of pegozafermin. 19 of 20 patents received an end of treatment biopsy and one patient withdrew consent. A greater than or equal to 2-point improvement in NAS (with 1-point from either ballooning or inflammation) and no worsening of fibrosis was the nominal primary endpoint. Key secondary endpoints included response rates on NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis, improvement in at least one stage of fibrosis without worsening NAS and safety/tolerability. Patients had a mean BMI of 37 and type 2 diabetes was prevalent in most patients. 65% had fibrosis stage F3 NASH and 35% had fibrosis stage F2 NASH, a higher proportion of F3 patients than is typical for most proof-of-concept NASH studies. The baseline values for VCTE, ProC3, and transaminases were consistent with a more advanced population.
 74% of patients achieved a greater than or equal to 2-point improvement in NAS with at least a 1-point improvement in ballooning or inflammation. Substantial reductions were observed across all 3 NAS components (≥1 point change) – ballooning (79%), inflammation (47%), and steatosis (74%). All patients had improvement or no change in ballooning and inflammation. The histology results demonstrate proof-of-concept for the translation of pegozafermin’s effects on liver fat, ALT, and other relevant non-invasive measures into histological improvement.

≥2-point improvement in NAS without worsening of fibrosis1 (primary endpoint) | 63% 
≥2-point improvement in NAS1 | 74% 
NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis | 32%; 95% CI: 13%-57%
One-stage improvement of fibrosis without worsening of NASH | 26%; 95% CI: 9%-51% 
NASH resolution or fibrosis improvement | 47% 

 NAS = NAFLD Activity Score
 1A 2-point improvement in NAS score required a 1-point improvement in either ballooning or inflammation
 Data from a new analysis of the same histology slides by a panel of an additional three expert liver pathologists resulted in a wide range of response rates, with rates of NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis up to 47% and rates of ≥ 1-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH up to 42% as shown in Figure 8 below.
 
Figure 8: New Analysis of Cohort 7 Histology Slides By a Panel of Three Experts

To assess pegozafermin’s effect on the whole liver, a number of NITs including imaging, serum biomarkers, and risk stratification scores were built into the study. Clinically meaningful and significant changes were observed across these key NITs associated with fibrosis, risk of fibrosis, or NASH resolution. The consistency of data across all these endpoints and the magnitude of changes observed in these NITs suggest that pegozafermin is improving total liver health.

 In 83 patients treated with pegozafermin across the full Phase 1b/2a study in cohorts 1 to 7, pegozafermin continues to be generally well tolerated with a favorable safety profile. There have been no drug-related serious adverse events and only one treatment-related discontinuation. Pooled pegozafermin treatment related adverse events in greater than or equal to 10% of patients were increased appetite (13% vs 0% placebo), diarrhea (13% vs 11% placebo), and nausea (12% vs 11% placebo). Most of the GI adverse events were mild and of short duration. A few mild injection site reactions were reported and there were no tremors and no hypersensitivity adverse events observed. Pegozafermin had no adverse effects on blood pressure or heart rate. 
 
Phase 2b (ENLIVEN) Trial in Fibrosis Stage 2 or 3 NASH Patients 
 
The ENLIVEN trial is planned to enroll NASH patients with fibrosis stage 2 or 3 and NAS ≥4. These patients will receive either 15 mg or 30 mg weekly doses or 44 mg every two-week dose of pegozafermin or placebo for 24 weeks followed by a blinded extension phase of an additional 24 weeks for a total treatment period of 48 weeks. We expect to report topline data in the first half of 2023. Based on learnings from our recent cohort, developments in the field, and feedback from our steering committee, we are working on steps to optimize the ENLIVEN trial.
 Pegozafermin Clinical Development in SHTG
 Pegozafermin has demonstrated significant reduction in triglyceride levels across all our preclinical and clinical studies. In our Phase 1b/2a trial, treatment with pegozafermin in cohorts 1 to 6 (mean baseline TG=174 mg/dL) and cohort 7 (mean baseline TG=170 mg/dL) resulted in significant reductions in triglycerides (up to 28% and 26% respectively) Triglycerides were reduced to a greater extent in patients with elevated levels at baseline across cohorts 1 to 6 (TG ≥ 200mg/mL) and cohort 7 (TG ≥ 150mg/mL) of 37% and 32%, respectively. While 
 18


currently approved SHTG therapies decrease triglyceride levels, they generally do not have broader metabolic benefits such as reduction in liver fat content, reduction in transaminases, and improvement in glycemic control. We presented data at the National Lipid Association meeting in 2021 that demonstrated a mean liver fat content of 20% at baseline in the first 14 patients in the MRI-PDFF sub-study of the ENTRIGUE trial. 
 We initiated the ENTRIGUE trial in SHTG patients in the third quarter of 2020 and have closed enrollment with 85 patients either on background lipid treatment with statins and/or prescription fish oil and/or fibrates or not on any background therapy. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients receive pegozafermin administered weekly (9 mg, 18 mg or 27 mg) or every two weeks (36 mg) or placebo over an eight-week treatment period. The primary endpoint is the percentage change in fasting triglyceride levels from baseline. Key secondary endpoints include other lipids and metabolic markers and a sub-study evaluating change in liver fat measured by MRI-PDFF. Screening in the fibrate cohort was stopped with the main study and will be analyzed as part of main ENTRIGUE trial. Topline data from ENTRIGUE is expected in the second quarter of 2022.
 There is regulatory precedence for the approval of therapies for the treatment of SHTG in the United States based on the reduction in triglycerides from baseline as the primary endpoint for full approval. The FDA surrogate endpoint table for drug approval lists a reduction in triglycerides from baseline as the endpoint for full approval of a therapy in SHTG. A clinical outcome study was not required for certain third-party approvals in SHTG or as a post-marketing commitment. The SHTG Phase 3 trial for some of these products consisted of a single study of 75 to 100 patients per treatment group with a 12-week duration. Based on the regulatory path followed by other companies that have successfully developed SHTG therapies, we believe that a combination of smaller clinical trials and shorter development timelines could mean that SHTG potentially represents a quicker path to market for pegozafermin. The Phase 3 trial could potentially evaluate pegozafermin as an add-on therapy in refractory patients or patients not on background therapy with a primary endpoint of percentage change in fasting triglyceride levels from baseline at 12-24 weeks. The key secondary endpoints could include an assessment of liver fat reduction, glycemic control, weight, and other lipids. The safety database could potentially include trials in other hypertriglyceridemia patient populations.

Agreements with Teva
 Agreements Relating to FGF21 Program
 In April 2018, we entered into an Asset Transfer and License Agreement (the “FGF21 Agreement”) with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (“Teva”), under which we acquired certain patents, intellectual property and other assets relating to Teva’s glycoPEGylated FGF21 program. Under this agreement, Teva also granted a perpetual, non-exclusive (but exclusive as to pegozafermin), non-transferable, worldwide license to patents and know-how related to glycoPEGylation technology for use in the research, development, manufacture and commercialization of the compound pegozafermin and products containing pegozafermin. In addition, we entered into a Sublicense Agreement with ratiopharm (the “ratiopharm Sublicense”), under which we were granted a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide sublicense to patents and know-how related to glycoPEGylation technology used in the development, manufacture and commercialization of pegozafermin and products containing pegozafermin.
 Under the FGF21 Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize pegozafermin in each of the United States and five major European countries. We have the right to sublicense all rights licensed to us by Teva under the FGF21 Agreement.
 Pursuant to the FGF21 Agreement and the FASN Agreement (as defined and described below), we paid Teva a nonrefundable upfront payment of $6.0 million. In addition, under the FGF21 Agreement, we are required to make certain payments to Teva totaling $2.5 million for the achievement of certain clinical development milestones, and additional payments totaling up to $65.0 million upon achievement of certain commercial milestones. We are also obligated to pay Teva tiered royalties at percentages in the low-to-mid single-digits on worldwide net sales of products containing pegozafermin. Our royalty obligations will terminate, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, at the later of: (1) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim in the assigned patents that covers pegozafermin in such country, (2) the expiration of data or regulatory exclusivity for pegozafermin in such country and (3) 10 years from the first commercial sale of pegozafermin in such country. We are not required to make any payments to ratiopharm pursuant to the ratiopharm Sublicense.
 The term of the FGF21 Agreement will continue, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the royalty term with respect to pegozafermin in such country expires. The ratiopharm Sublicense will continue until terminated in accordance with its terms. We may terminate the FGF21 Agreement and the ratiopharm Sublicense for any reason. Either party may terminate the FGF21 Agreement for cause for the other party’s uncured material breach. ratiopharm may terminate the ratiopharm Sublicense for certain material breaches by us. Either party may terminate the FGF21 Agreement or the ratiopharm Sublicense in the event of bankruptcy of the other party. Teva may terminate the FGF21 Agreement if we challenge the validity of any patent licensed to us under the FGF21 Agreement. Termination of the FGF21 Agreement or the ratiopharm Sublicense will impact our rights under the intellectual property licensed to us by Teva and ratiopharm, respectively, but will not affect our rights under the assets assigned to us.
 In April 2018, we also entered into a Reagent Supply and Technology Transfer Agreement, under which Teva will supply us with certain reagents required for the glycoPEGylation process that are necessary for our development and commercialization of pegozafermin, and transfer to us certain know-how required for the production of such reagents. The term of this agreement was extended by mutual agreement until December 31, 2022.
 FASN Agreements
 In April 2018, we entered into an Asset Transfer and License Agreement with Teva under which we acquired from Teva patents, intellectual property and other assets relating to Teva’s development program of small molecule inhibitors of FASN (the “FASN Agreement”). Under the FASN Agreement we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize FASN in the United States and five major European countries. We have the right to sublicense all rights licensed to us by Teva under the FASN Agreement.
 Pursuant to the FASN Agreement and the FGF21 Agreement (as described above), we paid Teva a nonrefundable upfront payment of $6.0 million. In addition, under the FASN Agreement, we are required to make certain payments to Teva totaling $2.5 million for the achievement of certain clinical development milestones, and 
 20


additional payments totaling up to $65.0 million upon achievement of certain commercial milestones. We are also obligated to pay Teva tiered royalties at percentages in the low-to-mid single-digits on worldwide net sales of products arising from the FASN program. Our royalty obligations will terminate, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, at the later of: (1) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim in the assigned patents that covers FASN in such country, (2) the expiration of data or regulatory exclusivity for such product arising from the FASN program in such country and (3) 10 years from the first commercial sale of a product arising from the FASN program in such country.
 The term of the FASN Agreement will continue, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the royalty term with respect to the product arising from the FASN program in such country expires. We may terminate the FASN Agreement for any reason. Either party may terminate the agreement for cause for the other party’s uncured material breach, or in the event of bankruptcy of the other party.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics, such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates.
 The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States is expensive and time-consuming. Generally, this process involves completing pre-clinical laboratory studies before the FDA will allow human clinical trials to commence. We are then required to complete human clinical trials to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective. Following the completion of these clinical trials, we are required to prepare and submit a biologics license (“BLA”) application, which presents the FDA with detailed clinical and safety data, as well as manufacturing data. As part of the review of a BLA, the FDA may inspect manufacturing facilities to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and may also inspect selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with current Good Clinical Practices (“cGCP”). This process takes many years from inception through filing of a BLA application and the likelihood of success is highly uncertain.
 Preclinical and Clinical Development
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an investigational new drug (“IND”) application to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. Submission of an IND may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Furthermore, an independent review board (“IRB”) for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. 
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
  
• | Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21


 
absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. 
 BLA Submission and Review
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
 Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts necessary inspections, the FDA may either issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted 
 22


distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions
 The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval. These programs can significantly reduce the time it takes for the FDA to review a BLA, but they do not guarantee that a product will receive FDA approval. Even if a product qualifies initially, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review will not be shortened.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon companies and third-party manufacturers. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program, among other potential consequences. 
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.

Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”) includes a provision called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. 
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), the federal False Claims Act, HIPAA and similar foreign, federal and state fraud, abuse and transparency laws.
 The federal AKS prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The AKS has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand, and prescribers and purchasers on the other. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the AKS. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 The federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act (“FCA”), which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of federal government funds, including federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for engaging in a variety of different types of conduct that caused the submission of false claims to federal healthcare programs. Under the AKS, for example, a claim resulting from a violation of the AKS is deemed to be a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The FCA imposes mandatory treble damages and per-violation civil penalties up to approximately $23,000.
 24


HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate the statute in order to have committed a violation.
 Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 The U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, such reporting obligations will be expanded to include payments and other transfers of value provided in 2021 to certain other healthcare professionals.
 Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a difficult and costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Data Privacy and Security
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA or other laws may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations. Further, entities that knowingly obtain, use, or disclose certain individually identifiable health information in an improper fashion may be subject to criminal penalties.
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance.
 25


Decisions regarding whether to cover any of our product candidates, if approved, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
 For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics.
 In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 For example, the Affordable Care Act has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. The Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, among other things, revised the methodology for calculating rebates for covered outpatient drugs and certain biologics owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and expanded programs designed to test innovative payment models, service delivery models, or value-based arrangements, and fund comparative effectiveness research.
 There remain legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. In December 2018, a United States District Court judge in Texas ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress in 2017. The decision was appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which overturned it on the basis that the plaintiffs lacked standing. The Supreme Court’s decision did not address the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, and left open the opportunity for additional challenges to the Affordable Care Act. It is unclear how such litigation and other efforts to repeal, replace or otherwise modify the Affordable Care Act will impact reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biological products.
 26


We anticipate that the Affordable Care Act, if substantially maintained in its current form, will continue to result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
 In addition, further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. 
 There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. In October 2020, the FDA issued guidance describing procedures for manufacturers to facilitate the importation of FDA-approved biologics manufactured abroad and originally intended for sale in a foreign country into the United States. Previously, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint,” or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contained proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers.
 Although the Biden administration has stayed the effective dates of some last-minute drug price regulations issued by the Trump administration, Congress and the Biden administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.
 Additional Regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, local, state and federal laws, including in the United States and Israel, regarding such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous or biohazardous substances, we could be liable for damages, environmental remediation, and/or governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid innovation and significant technological advancements. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of pegozafermin and any future product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price, the level of generic competition and reimbursement. Our competitors include multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions. A number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are pursuing the development or marketing of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases that we are targeting. Smaller or earlier-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Given the high incidence of NASH, it is likely that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of liver and cardio-metabolic diseases, such as NASH, will increase.
 27


If pegozafermin is approved for the treatment of NASH, future competition could also arise from select products currently in development, including: Firsocostat/GS-0976, an ACC inhibitor, and Cilofexor/GS-9674, an FXR agonist, from Gilead Sciences, Inc.; Clesacostat/PF-05221304, an ACC inhibitor, and PF-06835919, a KHK inhibitor, from Pfizer Inc.; Ocaliva, an FXR agonist from Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Resmetirom, a beta-thyroid hormone receptor agonist from Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; VK2809, a beta-thyroid hormone receptor agonist from Viking Therapeutics, Inc.; Aldafermin, an FGF19 analog from NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.; MK-3655, an FGFR1c/KLB agonist antibody from Merck & Co., Inc.; Efruxifermin, a FGF21 fusion protein from Akero Therapeutics, Inc.; Belapectin, a Galectin-3 inhibitor from Galectin Therapeutics Inc.; Aramchol, a synthetic conjugate of cholic acid and arachidic acid from Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd.; Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist from Novo Nordisk A/S; Pemvidutide/ALT-801, a dual GLP-1/glucagon agonist from Altimmune; Tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist from Eli Lilly and Company; and Lanifibranor, a PPAR alpha/delta/gamma agonist from Inventiva; NNC0194-0499, an FGF21 analog from Novo Nordisk; BOS-580, an FGF21 analog from Boston Pharmaceuticals; and BFKB8488A, an FGFR1/KLB agonist antibody from Genentech. 
 If pegozafermin is approved for the treatment of SHTG, we would face competition from currently approved and marketed products, including statins, fibrates, Vascepa (Pure EPA), and Lovaza (EPA and DHA), as well as generic products. Further competition could arise from products currently in development, including: Olezarsen/AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, an APOC3 inhibitor from Ionis; Evinacumab, an Anti-ANGPTL3 from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Pemafibrate, a PPAR alpha agonist from Kowa Research Institute, Inc.; and ARO-APOC3, an ApoC-III inhibitor from Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market technologically superior products. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly longer operating histories and greater experience than we have in undertaking nonclinical studies and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products and in obtaining regulatory approvals of human therapeutic products. Many of our competitors have established distribution channels for the commercialization of their products, whereas we have no such channel or capabilities. In addition, many competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive collaborative relationships. As a result, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidate or any future product candidates. Our competitors may also develop and succeed in obtaining approval for drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than we are in manufacturing and marketing their products. If we are unable to compete effectively against these companies, then we may not be able to commercialize our product candidate or any future product candidates or achieve a competitive position in the market. This would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue. Our competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling patients for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of pegozafermin, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if pegozafermin or any future product candidate receives marketing approval.
 Pegozafermin drug substance is manufactured by fermentation of a recombinant strain of the bacterium E. coli. Product accumulates as insoluble particles (inclusion bodies) within the cells and is recovered by cell disruption, followed by solubilization of the inclusion bodies, protein refolding and purification with two chromatographic separation columns. Purified material is glycoPEGylated in a 2-step enzymatic reaction where a 20kDa linear glycoPEG moiety is attached to the protein through GalNAc and Sialic Acid linkers.
 GlycoPEGylated protein is purified with two chromatographic columns to yield product with target quality attributes. Purified glycoPEGylated protein is concentrated and then formulated to a target concentration with formulation buffer as drug product.
 28


Northway Biotechpharma (“BTPH”) is our sole source supplier for pegozafermin. Any reduction or halt in supply of drug product from BTPH could limit our ability to develop pegozafermin until a replacement contract manufacturer is found and qualified. 
 We are working with BTPH and a second vendor on process optimization to support large-scale production for future trials and commercialization. We have successfully developed a new refrigerated liquid formulation. This formulation is approved by the FDA and is currently in use in our trials. We are currently developing an additional liquid formulation at various concentrations. In parallel, we have entered into a contract with a vendor for Pre-Filled Syringe (“PFS”) development and commercial fill.
 BTPH Agreement
 In May 2018, we entered into a master services agreement with BTPH, under which BTPH agreed to provide us certain services, including development, manufacturing, and storing of pegozafermin, under statements of work for such services to be agreed by the parties from time to time. The master services agreement will continue for the duration of time that BTPH is providing services to us, unless earlier terminated by either party upon its terms. We may terminate the agreement at any time after a specified notice period and subject to the payment of certain agreed upon fees where such termination results in cancellation of manufacturing scheduled within a certain period. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement for cause for the other party’s uncured material breach, in the event of bankruptcy of the other party, in the event of the commission of fraud by the other party or in the event of a force majeure.
 Sales and Marketing
 We currently have no marketing, sales or distribution capabilities. In order to commercialize any products that are approved for commercial sale, we must either develop a sales and marketing infrastructure or collaborate with third parties that have sales and marketing experience.
 We may elect to establish our own sales force to market and sell a product for which we obtain regulatory approval if we expect that the geographic market for a product we develop on our own is limited or that the prescriptions for the product will be written principally by a relatively small number of physicians. If we decide to market and sell any products ourselves, we do not expect to establish direct sales capability until shortly before the products are approved for commercial sale.
 We plan to seek third-party support from established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for those products that would benefit from the promotional support of a large sales and marketing force. In these cases, we might seek to promote our products in collaboration with marketing partners or rely on relationships with one or more companies with large established sales forces and distribution systems.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements. Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it through a variety of approaches, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, novel biological discoveries, new targets and applications, and other inventions that are important to our business. For our product candidates, we generally intend to pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter, methods of making and methods of use. As we continue the development of our product candidates, we plan to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including pursuit of claims directed to new therapeutic indications.

FGF21 Patents
 Our FGF21 patent portfolio includes four families:
 The first family is entitled “Remodeling and GlycoPEGylation of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)”. This patent family provides granted patent protection in 39 countries around the globe, including the United States (U.S. Patent Number 9,200,049, expiry date: June 25, 2028; and U.S. Patent No. 10,874,714, expiry date: October 10, 2028), Canada, Europe (broadly), and Japan (latter three expire October 31, 2025) for FGF21 conjugates comprising a variety of modifying groups that can be attached at several different amino acid positions. GlycoPEGylated FGF21 is specifically claimed. The granted claims broadly protect our lead drug candidate pegozafermin and pharmaceutical compositions thereof, as well as methods for making and using pegozafermin to treat FGF21 deficiency in a patient in need thereof. One U.S. application is pending in this family.
 The second family is entitled “Mutant FGF-21 Peptide Conjugate and Uses Thereof” and is specifically directed to pegozafermin. The PCT Patent Application for this family was filed on September 4, 2018 (PCT/IB2018/00112). A U.S. Prioritized Examination Continuation Patent Application (Application Serial No. 16/225,640) was filed on December 19, 2018 as a continuation of PCT/IB2018/0112 and from which U.S. Patent Number 10,407,479 was issued on September 10, 2019. The term of the U.S. Patent Number 10,407,479 is September 4, 2038. The issued claims are directed to pegozafermin and a defined genus specifically encompassing pegozafermin and compositions thereof (including site-specific mutations at positions 173 and 176), as well as methods for making and using pegozafermin for a variety of therapeutic indications. Such indications include methods for treating NASH or metabolic syndrome. Subjects where there is a need to reduce blood glucose or to reduce HbA1C include those afflicted with diabetes Type 2, NASH and metabolic syndrome. The claims encompass different therapeutic regimens for administering pegozafermin (e.g., once a week or once every two weeks), which regimens are based on pegozafermin’s surprisingly long half-life in vivo. One U.S. application is pending in this family. National phase entry of this PCT Application has been initiated in Australia (granted), Korea (granted), Europe, China (allowed), Hong Kong, Japan (granted), Canada and Israel to pursue global protection of specific mutant FGF21 peptide conjugates, and particularly pegozafermin, in these jurisdictions. Australian patent No. 2018322943 was granted on September 17, 2020 (expiry date: September 4, 2038). Korean patent No. 10-2229037 was granted on March 11, 2021 (expiry date: September 4, 2038). Japan patent No. 6852939 was granted on March 15, 2021 (expiry date: September 4, 2038). 
 The third family is entitled “Methods Of Treatment Using Mutant FGF-21 Peptide Conjugates”. A U.S. patent application was filed on May 28, 2020 (US Serial Number 16/885,353). This patent application is not published. 
 The fourth family is entitled “Methods for promoting weight loss”. A PCT application was filed January 29, 2021 (PCT/IB2021/000044) with claims directed towards method to reduce total body weight, body fat content and/or BMI. National phase entry of this application is due by July 31, 2022. 
 We will continue to file patent applications to cover various formulations of FGF21. We have filed a provisional application on March 11, 2021 on stable liquid formulation of FGF21. A PCT patent application claiming the benefit and priority to the provisional application will be filed by the March 11, 2022 deadline.
 FASN Patents
 Our FASN patent portfolio currently consists of three patent families, including patents and/or patent applications in the United States, the European Patent Convention, Canada, Mexico, Israel, China and Japan.
 The first patent family, directed to TEV-48317, which we acquired from Teva under the FASN Agreement, and other 1,4-substituted piperidine-based FASN inhibitors, is currently protected by three granted U.S. patents that cover these compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, and/or methods of treating FASN-mediated disorders using these compounds. The non-extended term for these patents would expire on June 17, 2036. A pending U.S. application has also been filed. The first patent family also includes twelve foreign patents and two foreign patent applications. The second patent family is directed to other 1,4-substituted piperidine-based FASN inhibitors, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of treating FASN-mediated disorders. The second patent family includes one granted U.S. patent, one U.S. patent application, nine foreign patents, and two foreign patent applications. The third patent family is directed to spiropiperidine FASN inhibitors, pharmaceutical 
 30


compositions containing these compounds, and methods of treating FASN-mediated disorders using these compounds. The third patent family includes one granted U.S. patent, one U.S. patent application and five foreign patent applications.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 41 full-time employees, of which 28 employees are engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Corporate Information
 We were incorporated in January 2018 in Israel under the name 89Bio Ltd. 89bio, Inc., the registrant whose name appears on the cover page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, was incorporated in June 2019 for the purpose of an internal reorganization transaction. In September 2019, all of the equity holders of 89Bio Ltd. exchanged 100% of the equity of 89Bio Ltd. for 100% of the equity of 89bio, Inc. Following this exchange, 89Bio Ltd. became a wholly owned subsidiary of 89bio, Inc. 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 142 Sansome Street, San Francisco, California 94104 and our telephone number is (415) 432-9270. Our website is www.89bio.com. Information contained on or accessible through our website is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the inclusion of our website address in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is an inactive textual reference only.
 We file electronically with the SEC our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We make available on our website at www.89bio.com, under “Investors,” free of charge, copies of these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after filing or furnishing these reports with the SEC.
 Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and a Smaller Reporting Company
 We are an “emerging growth company”, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including relief from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, less extensive disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our registration statements, periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation, and exemptions from stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may also elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information that they may deem important and the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than, and not comparable to, information presented by other public reporting companies. We could remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering (“IPO”), (2) the last day of the year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (3) the last day of the year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
 31


In addition, the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company may therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, as a result, will not be subject to the same implementation timing for new or revised accounting standards as are required of other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, which may make comparison of our consolidated financial information to those of other public companies more difficult.
 We are also a smaller reporting company, as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as (i) our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.
