 Item 1. Business
 Zix Corporation (“Zix®,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a leader in email security. Trusted by the nation’s most influential institutions in healthcare, finance, and government, Zix delivers a superior experience and easy-to-use solutions for email encryption, data loss prevention (“DLP”), advanced threat protection, archiving, and bring your own device (“BYOD”) mobile security. Focusing on the protection of business communication, Zix enables its customers to better secure data and meet compliance needs. We primarily serve organizations in the healthcare, financial services, insurance and government sectors, including U.S. federal financial regulators, such as members of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”), divisions of the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), more than 30% of U.S. banks, more than 30% of Blue Cross Blue Shield plans and more than 1,200 U.S. hospitals. 
 ZixEncryptSM (formerly ZixGateway® and ZixQuarantine®) bundles email encryption and DLP capabilities to enable the secure exchange of email that includes sensitive information. Through a comprehensive secure messaging service, ZixEncrypt allows an enterprise to use policy-driven rules to determine which email messages should be sent securely or quarantined for review to comply with regulations or company-defined policies. 
 The main differentiation for Zix Encrypt in the marketplace is our exceptional ease of use. The best example of this is our ability to provide transparent delivery of encrypted email. Most email encryption solutions are focused on the sender. They typically introduce an added burden on recipients, often requiring additional user authentication with creation of new user identity and password. We designed our solution to alleviate the recipient’s burden by enabling the delivery of encrypted email automatically and transparently. Zix enables transparent delivery by (1) ZixDirectory®, the world’s largest email encryption community, which is designed to share identities of our tens of millions of members (growing by approximately 160,000 members per week), (2) Zix’s patented Best Method of Delivery®, which is designed to deliver email in the most secure, most convenient method possible for the recipient, and (3) ZixEncrypt, which automatically encrypts and decrypts messages with sensitive content. The result is secure, transparent encrypted email, such that secure email can be exchanged without any impact to administrators or extra steps for both senders and recipients. Zix delivers more than 1.5 million encrypted messages on a typical business day. Of those, approximately 70% are exchanged transparently between senders and recipients.
 ZixEncrypt also addresses a business’s greatest source of data loss – corporate email – with an easy straightforward DLP approach. By focusing strictly on the risks of email, ZixEncrypt simplifies DLP in comparison to other DLP solutions by decreasing complexity and costs, reducing deployment time from months to hours and minimizing impact on customer resources and workflow. In addition, Zix offers a convenient experience for both employees interacting with our solution and administrators managing the system.
 ZixEncrypt enables DLP capabilities for email by combining proven policy and content scanning capabilities with quarantine functionality. The quarantine system and its intuitive interface allows administrators to (1) easily define policies and create custom lexicons for quarantining email messages, (2) conveniently manage quarantined messages using flexible searching and filtering options, (3) release or delete individual or multiple quarantined messages with one click, (4) review reports that monitor quarantine activities and trends and (5) automate custom notifications informing employees of quarantined messages.
 ZixEncrypt also provides greater visibility into an organization’s data risks in email by capturing data in outbound emails and highlighting violations that trigger policy filters to encrypt or quarantine. Through our interactive, real-time interface, companies can monitor their greatest vulnerabilities, generate reports for business executives and train employees about the sensitivity of their company’s data. 
 ZixEncrypt is available as a hosted solution, as a multi-tenant cloud solution, or as a physical or virtual on-premises appliance.
 In March 2017, Zix acquired Greenview Data Inc. (“Greenview”), an email security company. Zix’s acquisition of Greenview addresses increasing buyer demand for email security bundles by adding advanced threat protection, antivirus, anti-spam and archiving capabilities to its industry-leading email encryption. Greenview is a good fit for Zix’s business based on its employees’ expertise in email security and its emphasis on customer success, which align with Zix’s reputation for delivering industry-leading solutions and a superior experience.
 Through the acquisition of Greenview, Zix launched two new solutions in April 2017 – ZixProtect and ZixArchive.  ZixProtect defends organizations from zero-day malware, ransomware, phishing, CEO fraud, W-2 phishing attacks, spam and viruses in email with multi-layer filtering techniques. Accuracy in protecting organizations from email threats is increased further with automated traffic analysis, machine learning and real-time threat analysis.

ZixProtect is available as a cloud-based service in three bundles. ZixProtect Essentials includes email threat protection, impersonation defense, 0-hour malware filtering, and business email continuity to enable access to emails during service disruption; ZixProtect Plus adds policy based Content Disarm and Reconstruction with on-demand sandboxing, as well as time-of-click link defense, to provide enhanced protection against sophisticated, targeted threats; and ZixProtect Premium delivers a comprehensive email security solution by including our leading email encryption and data loss prevention with our threat protection capabilities.
 ZixArchive is a low-cost, cloud-based email retention solution that easily enables user retrieval, compliance and eDiscovery. Available as a standalone or add-on solution for ZixEncrypt or ZixProtect bundles, ZixArchive includes policy-based retention, automatic indexing and flexible search capabilities for audit and legal requirements. With on-demand access through the cloud, organizations can conveniently share messages with employees, auditors and outside consultants or legal counsel, as well as revoke access when needed. 
 In April 2018, Zix acquired CM2.COM, Inc., d/b/a Erado (“Erado”), a unified archiving company. Erado strengthens Zix’s comprehensive archiving solutions with unified archiving, supervision, security, and messaging solutions for customers that demand bundled services. Erado’s long standing focus on helping its customers comply with FINRA and SEC regulations helps further strengthen Zix’s offerings for customers with compliance requirements. This acquisition also expands Zix’s cloud-based email archiving capabilities into more than 50 content channels, including social medial, instant message, mobile, web, audio, and video.
 ZixOne® is a unique mobile email app that solves the key IT challenge created by the BYOD trend in the workplace. BYOD describes employee’s use of personal devices to conduct work. ZixOne provides mobile access to corporate email while never allowing that data to be persistently stored on an employee’s device where it is vulnerable to loss or theft. If the device is lost or stolen, an administrator can simply disable access to corporate email from that device through ZixOne.
 ZixOne is available as a standalone solution and easily integrates with ZixEncrypt as an add-on solution. One feature of ZixOne is the ability to encrypt an email from your mobile device with the simple slide of an “Encrypt” button, ensuring that sensitive information is secured either by the user or through automatic policies of ZixEncrypt.
 Unlike other BYOD solutions, ZixOne meets employee desire for convenience, control and privacy while giving companies the ability to secure corporate data and meet compliance needs. With seamless access to work email in a secure, simple-to-use environment, employees can stay productive while preserving device independence. A BYOD solution that is acceptable to employees and yet provides strong data protection for corporate data solves one of today’s greatest IT management challenges.
 Our business operations and service offerings are supported by the ZixData CenterTM, which is PCI DSS 3.2 certified for applicable services, SOC2 accredited, and SOC3 certified. The operations of the ZixData Center are independently audited annually to maintain AICPA SOC3 certification in the areas of security, confidentiality, integrity and availability. Auditors also produce a SOC2 report on the effectiveness of operational controls used over the audit period. The ZixData Center is staffed 24 hours a day and has a track record that exceeds 99.99% availability.
 On February 20, 2019, Zix completed its acquisition of AppRiver, LLC (“AppRiver”), a channel-first provider of cloud-based cyber security and productivity services, offering web protection, email encryption, secure archiving, and email continuity solutions. AppRiver is a channel-first provider of cloud-based cyber security and productivity services, offering web protection, email encryption, secure archiving, and email continuity solutions. AppRiver also provides Microsoft Office 365 and Secure Hosted Exchange services, which serve as an effective lead generation tool for the company’s solutions. The acquisition of AppRiver can accelerate our offerings into the cloud at the point of initial cloud application purchase. Because AppRiver currently services over 60,000 worldwide customers using a network of 4,500 Managed Service Providers, this acquisition also helps us expand our customer base.
 Our company was incorporated in Texas in 1988. Originally named Amtech Corporation, we changed our name to ZixIt® Corporation in 1999 when we entered the encrypted email market. In 2002, we became Zix Corporation, and in 2017, the Company rebranded to Zix. Our executive offices are located at 2711 North Haskell Avenue, Suite 2200, LB 36, Dallas, Texas 75204-2960, (214) 370-2000.
 Overview
 Email is a mission-critical means of communication for enterprises. However, if email leaves a secure network environment in clear text, it can be intercepted along the path between a sender and a recipient, which permits theft, redirection, manipulation or exposure to unauthorized parties. Failure to control and manage such risks can result in enforcement penalties for noncompliance under numerous regulations, in addition to damaged reputation, competitive disadvantage, a loss of intellectual property or other corporate assets, exposure to negligence or liability claims, and diversion of resources to repair such damage. For example, healthcare organizations, business associates and sub-contractors are subject to the Privacy, Security, and Enforcement Rules of the Health

Information Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”). Financial institutions are subject to data privacy laws including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”). These federal laws help drive the use of encrypted email. In addition, individual states such as Massachusetts and Nevada have enacted privacy laws requiring the safeguard of personal data, and almost all states encourage email encryption by allowing exemptions from data breach notification laws.
 Corporations require easy to use, cost-effective email protection that can be used on an enterprise-wide basis. They need it to be quickly deployed and regularly updated to evolve with innovative technology practices and meet changing regulatory standards. To satisfy these needs, our Email Encryption Service provides a comprehensive solution that analyzes and encrypts email communications.
 Our Email Encryption Service allows a user to send encrypted email to any email user anywhere and on any Internet-enabled device. Encrypted email is delivered through the patented Best Method of Delivery protocol which automatically determines the most direct and appropriate means of delivery, based on the sender’s and recipient’s communications environment and preferences. The protocol supports a number of encrypted email delivery mechanisms, including S/MIME, Transport Layer Security (“TLS”), Open Pretty Good Privacy (“PGP”), “push” delivery and secure portal “pull” delivery. These last two mechanisms enable users to send messages securely to anyone with an email address, including those who do not have an encryption tool. Our Best Method of Delivery makes the technology simple for end users and provides flexibility and ease of implementation for information technology professionals. We believe the ability to send messages through different modes of delivery is one of many differentiators that makes our Email Encryption Service superior to competitive offerings.
 The deployment of our Email Encryption Service at the periphery of the customer’s network means our Email Encryption Service encrypts outbound email for an enterprise without the need to create, deploy or manage end user encryption keys or deploy desktop software. Our technology solutions are easy to use, easy to deploy, and can be made operational quickly.
 Our service has an integrated policy management capability. This policy engine can inspect the contents of emails and apply policies matching specific industry criteria such as HIPAA, the HITECH Act and GLBA. Customers can also build their own custom policies. This policy driven email encryption for regulatory compliance means customers can reduce the training required of their staff and significantly reduce the risk of inadvertently sending sensitive content by controlling the method of delivery through preset policies.
 Email is the number one communication tool for businesses and it is also one of the top vectors for cyberattacks. Attacks can jeopardize a company through malware, phishing, ransomware, business email compromise, viruses and other threats. Our advanced threat protection solution uses a multi-layer approach to accurately identify email threats and defend against email-borne attacks. Our threat filters first analyze IP addresses and URLs then examine content for targeted phrases, campaign patterns and both known and zero-hour malware attacks. Accuracy is increased further with real-time threat analysts, automated traffic analysis and machine learning.
 To safeguard against increasingly targeted and sophisticated attacks, our advanced threat protection can also leverage attachment assurance and time-of-click link defense to provide enhanced protection. Attachment assurance offers quarantine and sandbox inspection of emails to perform forensic analysis of attachments in our secure, cloud-based sandbox environment. Testing efficiently handles evasive attacker techniques while fully examining files for suspicious and malicious activity. Time-of-click link defense reduces the risk of users clicking links in emails and inadvertently visiting malicious or compromised websites. This feature re-writes all full, shortened, or obfuscated links to safe versions and performs time-of-click analysis on the destination address, including IP address and domain blacklists, domain age and reputation, and other checks.
 By combining our email encryption and advanced threat protection solutions, Zix meets customers’ increasing desire for a bundled solution that protects inbound and outbound email with leading email security.
 Competition
 The most significant differentiators for Zix as compared with our competition is ease of use and exceptional support. The best example of our unequalled ease of use is transparent delivery of encrypted email messages. We are able to deliver transparent email encryption as a result of our ZixDirectory, Best Method of Delivery and ZixEncrypt. The most critical and highly differentiated component of our solution is the ZixDirectory which provides the ability to share user identities for encryption, and in turn provides frictionless interoperability between users in a community of interest such as healthcare, finance or government.

Our capability to offer interoperability is particularly important when it is necessary to communicate with external networks, as is the case with the healthcare and financial services markets. Our customers become part of the ZixDirectory, a global “white pages” enabling transparent secure communications with other ZixEncrypt customers using our centralized key management system and overall unique approach to implementing encrypted email. We enable secure communications with other users via TLS, Open PGP, “push” delivery and secure portal “pull” delivery mechanisms. However, we believe our unique transparent delivery is the more preferred delivery model.
 Our exceptional support allows customers to reach Zix via phone or email 24/7/365 to address any questions or concerns. With the increasing cost and sophistication of email attacks, convenient access to our threat analysts at any time of the day provides our customers with unmatched peace of mind.
 We view our primary competitors in the email security space to be Proofpoint Inc., Mimecast, and Barracuda Networks. Technically, while these companies offer advanced threat protection against email attacks and “send-to-anyone” encrypted email, we believe that Zix offers superior customer service and unparalleled benefits that come from access to the ZixDirectory, use of our Best Method of Delivery protocol, and the industry’s only transparent email encryption. Nevertheless, some of these competitors are large enterprises with substantial financial and technical resources that exceed those we possess.
 Regulatory Drivers
 We have been successful in securing market penetration in our target vertical markets of healthcare, finance services and government primarily due to regulations that address the need for data privacy and security.
 In addition to the need to protect personal data and sensitive business communication, demand for email security in the healthcare sector, including business associates of healthcare providers, is augmented by regulatory requirements under HIPAA and HITECH Act. The Privacy and Security rules under those acts provide severe penalties for violations, include strict breach notification requirements, and allow states to pursue HIPAA violations. In the financial services industry, financial institutions and their service providers are subject to the GLBA, which is enforced by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). The FTC has issued guidance saying that businesses that transmit sensitive data by email should be sure to encrypt the data.
 In choosing an email security provider, companies are influenced by the solutions chosen by their regulators. Our customers include all of the federal regulators that comprise the FFIEC as well as the state banking regulators in more than twenty states. Our service is also a recommended solution of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, whose members regulate the more than 4,600 state-chartered banks in the U.S.
 Additionally, state data breach laws and privacy regulations, along with highly publicized breaches, have enhanced security awareness in vertical markets outside of healthcare and financial services and have prompted affected organizations to consider adopting systems that ensure data security and privacy. Even where there are no specific regulations, businesses may require email protection to adhere to evolving industry best practices for protecting sensitive information.
 Sales and Marketing
 We sell our Zix Email Encryption, ZixProtect, ZixArchive, Zix DLP, and ZixOne Services through a direct sales force that focuses on larger businesses and a telesales force that focuses on small to medium-sized accounts. We also use a network of resellers and other distribution partners, including other service providers seeking an email encryption offering in an original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”)-like relationship. New first year orders (“NFYOs”), defined as the twelve-month value of orders received from both new customers and from our existing customers ordering additional products or features, derived from our value-added resellers, OEM and third party distribution channels for 2018 were 43% of the total new first year orders compared to 56% in 2017. The reduction in orders received from our OEM channels was due in part to a migration of customers from our Google relationship into a direct relationship with Zix. In both years, the balance of our NFYOs were originated by our telesales and direct sales forces. As of December 31, 2018, we had 157 value-added resellers and 97 managed security service providers across the U.S. 
Employees
 We had 265 employees as of December 31, 2018. The majority of our employees are located in Dallas, Texas. We also have a sales office in Burlington, Massachusetts; an office in Ann Arbor, Michigan supporting ZixProtect and ZixArchive services; and smaller offices located in Renton, Washington, and in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Research and Development 
 We incurred research and development (“R&D”) expenses of $11.3 million, $11.0 million, and $9.6 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
 Over the course of 2018 we continued to make investments toward strengthening and expanding our service portfolio while aligning with customer trends toward simplification of infrastructure management through the use of cloud technologies. A new cloud platform was delivered which allows Managed Service Providers to provision and handle traffic on infrastructure run and managed by Zix. The new services and infrastructure were also extended to become the foundation for new security and compliance bundles for direct and alternative channels which include enhanced variants of core Threat Protection, Encryption, Continuity and Archiving Technologies. 
 In delivering new security and compliance bundles, the R&D organization materially enhanced and integrated the subsystem platforms obtained by way of acquisitions in 2017 and 2018.  Web technology implementations associated with Threat Protection/Continuity and Multimedia Archive/Compliance platforms, obtained by way of acquisitions of Greenview Data and Erado respectively, were restructured to align to a new unified user experience model as were legacy Encryption subsystems and associated reporting and management capabilities.  Most related services were enhanced with technologies to enable automation of customer-driven provisioning.  We also completed branding and mobile-first modernization of the web interface for the encryption appliance software we acquired from Entrust Datacard and are now in the process of binding it into our Encryption Best-Method-of-Delivery framework, thus enabling on-premises message delivery portal options for our customers. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We depend upon our ability to develop, maintain and protect our proprietary technology and our related intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology and related property rights and to defend against infringement and/or misappropriation claims from others. We own 25 U.S. patents with expiration dates ranging from 2019 through 2036, and 10 pending U.S. Applications. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents and trademarks in the United States and in specific foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. While intellectual property rights are generally important to our business, we do not believe that our business is dependent on any single item of intellectual property, or that any single item of intellectual property is material to the operation of our business. Rather, we believe that our intellectual property rights provide us with a competitive advantage, and from time to time we have taken steps to enforce our intellectual property rights as a means of protecting that competitive advantage.
 Our Company and certain of our subsidiaries are the owners of trademarks and service marks registered with the United States Patent & Trademark Office. These marks are renewable indefinitely, contingent upon continued use and payment of applicable renewal fees. Additionally, our Company and certain of our subsidiaries own several pending trademark applications with the United States Patent & Trademark Office as well as a number of United States common law trademarks and several service marks and trademarks and service marks registered in foreign countries. We consider our trademark and service marks as valuable assets of the Company due to their recognition by our customers. We are not aware of any valid claims of infringement or challenges to our right to use any of our trademarks or service marks in the United States.
 Please see generally the risks that are more fully disclosed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for risks related to our intellectual property. 
 Compliance with Environmental Regulations
 We have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, any material expenditures or obligations related to environmental compliance issues.
 Governmental Contracts
 We have contracts with many local, state and federal agencies and regulators, which in the aggregate contributed approximately 7% of our annual revenue in 2018.
 Significant Customers

Backlog
 Our backlog is comprised of contractual commitments that we expect to recognize as revenue in the future. Our backlog was $73.0 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $72.6 million at December 31, 2017.
 As of December 31, 2018, our backlog is comprised of the following elements: $32.1 million of deferred revenue that has been billed and paid, $10.7 million billed but unpaid, and approximately $30.2 million of unbilled contracts.
 The backlog is recognized into revenue ratably as the services are performed. Approximately 65% of our total backlog at December 31, 2018, is expected to be recognized as revenue during the next twelve months.
 Seasonality
 The Company typically experiences lower NFYO’s in the first quarter of the calendar year. Our budget anticipates fewer NFYO’s in the first quarter, but historically this has not resulted in a material impact to our revenue or earnings on a seasonal basis.
Geographic Information
 Our operations are primarily based in the U.S., with approximately 4% of our employees located in Canada. Except for a United Kingdom based data center, we did not operate in, or have dependencies on, any other foreign countries as of December 31, 2018. Our revenues and orders to-date are almost entirely sourced in the U.S. and all significant corporate assets at December 31, 2018, were located in the U.S.
Financial Information About Industry Segments
 We have one reportable segment consisting of email encryption and security solutions. We internally evaluate all of our product offerings and other sources of revenue as one industry segment, and, accordingly, do not report segment information.
