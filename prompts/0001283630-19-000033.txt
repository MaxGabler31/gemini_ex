Item 1.  Business
Overview

American Campus Communities, Inc. (“ACC”) is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that commenced operations effective with the completion of an initial public offering (“IPO”) on August 17, 2004. Through ACC’s controlling interest in American Campus Communities Operating Partnership, L.P. (“ACCOP”), ACC is the largest owner, manager and developer of high quality student housing properties in the United States in terms of beds owned and under management. ACC is a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered equity REIT with expertise in the acquisition, design, financing, development, construction management, leasing and management of student housing properties. ACC’s common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “ACC.”

The general partner of ACCOP is American Campus Communities Holdings, LLC (“ACC Holdings”), an entity that is wholly-owned by ACC. As of December 31, 2018, ACC Holdings held an ownership interest in ACCOP of less than 1%. The limited partners of ACCOP are ACC and other limited partners consisting of current and former members of management and nonaffiliated third parties.  As of December 31, 2018, ACC owned an approximate 99.5% limited partnership interest in ACCOP.  As the sole member of the general partner of ACCOP, ACC has exclusive control of ACCOP’s day-to-day management.  Management operates ACC and ACCOP as one business.  The management of ACC consists of the same members as the management of ACCOP.  ACC consolidates ACCOP for financial reporting purposes, and ACC does not have significant assets other than its investment in ACCOP.  Therefore, the assets and liabilities of ACC and ACCOP are the same on their respective financial statements. References to the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” mean collectively ACC, ACCOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by ACC and/or ACCOP.  References to the “Operating Partnership” mean collectively ACCOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by ACCOP.

As of December 31, 2018, our total owned and third-party managed portfolio included 204 properties with approximately 133,900 beds.

Business Objectives, Investment Strategies, and Operating Segments

Business Objectives

Our primary business objectives are to create long-term stockholder value by deploying capital to develop, redevelop, acquire and operate student housing communities, and to sell communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy and when market conditions are favorable.  We believe we can achieve these objectives by continuing to implement our investment strategies and successfully manage our operating segments, which are described in more detail below.
Investment Strategies
We seek to own high quality, well designed and well located student housing properties. We seek to acquire or develop properties in markets that have stable or increasing student populations, are in submarkets with barriers to entry and provide opportunities for economic growth as a result of their product position and/or differentiated design and close proximity to campuses, or through our superior operational capabilities. We believe that our reputation and established relationships with universities give us an advantage in sourcing acquisitions and developments and obtaining municipal approvals and community support for our development projects.
Development
Our experienced development staff intends to continue to identify and acquire land parcels in close proximity to colleges and universities that offer location advantages or that allow for the development of unique products that offer a competitive advantage.  We expect to continue to benefit from opportunities derived from our extensive network with colleges and universities as well as our relationship with certain developers with whom we have previously developed student housing properties.

(1) | The Disney College Program project will be delivered in multiple phases over several years with initial deliveries expected to occur in 2020 and full development completion in 2021. All phases are counted as one property.

Presale Development Projects:
Under the terms of a presale transaction, the Company is obligated to purchase the property as long as certain construction completion deadlines and other closing conditions are met. As a part of the presale agreements, the Company has the option to elect not to purchase the asset, which would result in the Company paying a significant penalty if the developer is not in default under the terms of the presale agreement. The Company is responsible for leasing, management, and initial operations of the project while the third-party developer retains development risk during the construction period. In accordance with accounting guidance, the Company includes presale properties in its consolidated financial statements upon execution of the presale agreement with the developer.

Operating Segments

We define business segments by their distinct customer base and service provided.  We have identified four reportable segments: Owned Properties, On-Campus Participating Properties, Development Services and Property Management Services.  For a detailed financial analysis of our segments’ results of operations and financial position, please refer to Note 17 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.
Property Operations

Unique Leasing Characteristics:  Student housing properties are typically leased by the bed on an individual lease liability basis, unlike multifamily housing where leasing is by the unit.  Individual lease liability limits each resident’s liability to his or her own rent without liability for a roommate’s rent.  A parent or guardian is generally required to execute each lease as a guarantor unless the resident provides adequate proof of income or financial aid.  The number of lease contracts that we administer is therefore approximately equivalent to the number of beds occupied and not the number of units. Leases at our off-campus properties typically require 12 monthly rental installments, whereas leases for our residence hall properties typically correspond to the university’s academic year and require ten monthly rental installments.  Please refer to the property table contained in Item 2 – Properties for a listing of the typical rent payment terms at our properties.  As an example, in the case of our typical off-campus leases, the commencement date coincides with the commencement of the respective university’s Fall academic term and the termination date is the last day of the subsequent summer school session.  As such, we must re-lease each property in its entirety each year.

Management Philosophy:  Our management philosophy is based upon meeting the following objectives:

• | Satisfying the specialized needs of residents by providing the highest levels of customer service;


• | Developing and maintaining an academically oriented environment via a premier residence life/student development program;


• | Maintaining each project’s physical plant in top condition;


• | Maximizing revenue through the development and implementation of a strategic annual marketing plan and leasing administration program; and


• | Maximizing cash flow through maximizing revenue coupled with prudent control of expenses.

3


LAMS:  We believe we have developed the industry’s only specialized, fully integrated leasing administration and marketing software program, which we call LAMS. We utilize LAMS to maximize our revenue and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our marketing and lease administration process. Through LAMS, each of our properties’ ongoing marketing and leasing efforts are supervised at the corporate office on a real time basis. Among other things, LAMS provides:

• | a fully integrated prospect tracking and follow-up system;


• | a built-in marketing effectiveness program to measure the success of our marketing efforts on a real time basis;


• | a real-time monitor of lease closings and leasing terms;


• | an automated lease generation system;


• | the generation of future period rent rolls to aid in budgeting and forecasting; and


• | a customized report writer.


Owned Properties:  Off-campus properties are generally located in close proximity to the school campus, generally with pedestrian, bicycle, or university shuttle access.  Off-campus housing tends to offer more relaxed rules and regulations than on-campus housing, resulting in off-campus housing being generally more appealing to upper-classmen.  We believe that the support of colleges and universities can be beneficial to the success of our owned properties.  We actively seek to have these institutions recommend our facilities to their students or to provide us with mailing lists so that we may directly market to students and parents.  In some cases, the institutions actually promote our off-campus facilities in their recruiting and admissions literature.  In cases where the educational institutions do not provide mailing lists or recommendations for off-campus housing, most provide comprehensive lists of suitable properties to their students, and we continually work to ensure that our properties are on these lists in each of the markets that we serve.

Off-campus housing is subject to competition for tenants with on-campus housing owned by colleges and universities, and vice versa.  Colleges and universities can generally avoid real estate taxes and borrow funds at lower interest rates than us (and other private sector operators), thereby decreasing their operating costs.  Residence halls owned and operated by the primary colleges and universities in the markets of our off-campus properties may charge lower rental rates, but typically offer fewer amenities than we offer at our properties.  Additionally, most universities are only able to house a small percentage of their overall enrollment, and are therefore highly dependent upon the off-campus market to provide housing for their students.  High-quality, well run off-campus student housing can be a critical component to an institution’s ability to attract and retain students.  Therefore, developing and maintaining good relationships with educational institutions can result in a privately owned off-campus facility becoming, in effect, an extension of the institution’s housing program, with the institution providing highly valued references and recommendations to students and parents.

This segment also competes with national and regional owner-operators of off-campus student housing in a number of markets as well as with smaller local owner-operators.  Therefore, the performance of this segment could be affected by the construction of new on-campus or off-campus residences, increases or decreases in the general levels of rents for housing in competing communities, increases or decreases in the number of students enrolled at one or more of the colleges or universities in the market of a property, and other general economic conditions.

American Campus Equity ("ACE®"):  Included in our owned properties segment and branded and marketed to colleges and universities as the ACE program, this transaction structure provides us with what we believe is a lower-risk opportunity compared to other off-campus projects, as our ACE projects have premier on-campus locations with marketing and operational assistance from the university.  The subject university substantially benefits by increasing its housing capacity with modern, well-amenitized student housing with no or minimal impacts to its own credit ratios, preserving the university’s credit capacity to fund academic and research facilities.
In 2018, we expanded our ACE program and executed an agreement to develop a ten-phase purpose-built housing project serving student interns participating in the highly competitive Disney College Program.  This project offers natural synergies with our other ACE projects and exploits our core competency of housing college students.  The project will serve the highly competitive student internship program, which has been part of Walt Disney World® Resort for almost 40-years. The $614.6 million living-learning community will include ACC-designed units offering a variety of configurations and price points providing privacy and individuality for college student participants. The development will also include a centralized 25,000-square-foot Disney Education Center located on site, offering college accredited coursework allowing participants to earn credit hours transferrable to their respective universities.

On-Campus Participating Properties:  Our On-Campus Participating Properties segment includes five on-campus properties that are operated under long-term ground/facility leases with three university systems. Under our ground/facility leases, we receive an annual distribution representing 50% of these properties’ net cash flows, as defined in the ground/facility lease agreements.  We also manage these properties under long-term management agreements and are paid management fees equal to a percentage of defined gross receipts.  Refer to Note 8 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 herein for a more detailed description of these properties.
Our on-campus participating properties are susceptible to some of the same risks as our owned properties, including: (i) seasonality in rents; (ii) annual re-leasing that is highly dependent on marketing and university admission policies; and (iii) competition for tenants from other on-campus housing operated by educational institutions or other off-campus properties.

Third-Party Services

Our third-party services consist of development services and management services and are typically provided to university and college clients.  Many of our third-party management services are provided to clients for whom we also provide development services.  While management evaluates the operational performance of our third-party services based on the distinct segments identified below, at times we also evaluate these segments on a combined basis.

Development Services:  Our Development Services segment consists of development and construction management services that we provide through one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”) for third-party owners.  These services range from short-term consulting projects to long-term full-scale development and construction projects.  We typically provide these services to colleges and universities seeking to modernize their on-campus student housing properties.  They look to us to bring our student housing experience and expertise to ensure they develop marketable, functional and financially sustainable facilities.  Educational institutions usually seek to build housing that will enhance their recruitment and retention of students while facilitating their academic objectives.  Most of these development service contracts are awarded via a competitive request for proposal (“RFP”) process that qualifies developers based on their overall capability to provide specialized student housing design, development, construction management, financial structuring and property management services.  Our development services typically include pre-development, design and financial structuring services.  Our pre-development services typically include feasibility studies for third-party owners and design services.  Feasibility studies include an initial feasibility analysis, review of conceptual design and assistance with master planning.  Some of the documents produced in this process include the conceptual design documents, preliminary development and operating budgets, cash flow projections and a preliminary market assessment.  Our design services include coordination with the architect and other members of the design team, review of construction plans and assistance with project due diligence and project budgets.

Construction management services typically consist of hiring project professionals and a general contractor, coordinating and supervising the construction, equipping and furnishing the property, site visits, and full coordination and administration of all activities necessary for project completion in accordance with plans and specifications and with verification of adequate insurance.

Our Development Services activities benefit our primary goal of owning and operating student housing properties in a number of ways.  By providing these services to others, we are able to expand and refine our unit plan and community design, the operational efficiency of our material specifications and our ability to determine market acceptance of unit and community amenities.  Our development and construction management personnel enable us to establish relationships with general contractors, architects and project professionals throughout the nation.  Through these services, we gain experience and expertise in residential and commercial construction methodologies under various labor conditions, including right-to-work labor markets, markets subject to prevailing wage requirements and fully unionized environments.  This segment is subject to competition from other specialized student housing development companies as well as from national real estate development companies.

Property Management Services:  Our Property Management Services segment includes revenues generated from third-party management contracts in which we are typically responsible for all aspects of operations, including marketing, leasing administration, facilities maintenance, business administration, accounts payable, accounts receivable, financial reporting, capital projects and residence life student development.  We provide these services pursuant to management agreements that have initial terms that range from one to five years.

There are several housing options that compete with our third-party managed properties including, but not limited to, multifamily housing, for-rent single family dwellings, other off-campus specialized student housing and the aforementioned on-campus participating properties. We also compete with other regional and national providers of third-party management services.

Americans with Disabilities Act and Federal Fair Housing Act

Many laws and governmental regulations are applicable to our properties and changes in the laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently.  Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA.  The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable.  We believe that the existing properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA.  However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we intend to continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Under the federal and state fair housing laws, discrimination on the basis of certain protected classes is prohibited.  Violation of these laws can result in significant damage awards to victims.
Environmental Matters

Under various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, an owner of real estate may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in its property.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was responsible for, or even knew of, the presence of such substances.  The presence of such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to rent or sell the property or use the property as collateral.  Independent environmental consultants conducted environmental site assessments on all acquired or developed owned properties and on-campus participating properties in our existing portfolio.  We are not aware of any environmental conditions that management believes would have a material adverse effect on the Company.  There is no assurance, however, that environmental site assessments or other investigations would reveal all environmental conditions or that environmental conditions not known to us may exist now or in the future which would result in liability to the Company for remediation or fines, either under existing laws and regulations or future changes to such requirements.

From time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, designates certain sites affected by hazardous substances as “Superfund” sites pursuant to CERCLA.  Superfund sites can cover large areas, affecting many different parcels of land.  Although CERCLA imposes joint and several liability for contamination on property owners and operators regardless of fault, the EPA may choose to pursue potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) based on their actual contribution to the contamination.  PRPs are liable for the costs of responding to the hazardous substances.  Each of Villas on Apache (disposed of in April 2011), The Village on University (disposed of in December 2006) and University Village at San Bernardino (disposed of in January 2005) are located within federal Superfund sites.  The EPA designated these areas as Superfund sites because groundwater underneath these areas is contaminated.  We have not been named, and do not expect to be named, as a PRP with respect to these sites.  However, there can be no assurance regarding potential future developments concerning such sites.

Insurance

Our primary lines of insurance coverage are property, liability and workers’ compensation.  We believe that our insurance coverages are of the type and amount customarily obtained on real property assets.  We intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire in the future.  However, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from floods or earthquakes, which may be subject to limitations in certain areas.  When not otherwise contractually stipulated, we exercise our judgment in determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibles, in an effort to maintain appropriate levels of insurance on our investments.  If we suffer a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient due to market conditions at the time or other unforeseen factors.  Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed.
