ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report, references to “Q2Earth,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us” and words of similar import refer to Q2Earth, Inc., the Registrant, a Delaware corporation. References to “Q2P” or the “Subsidiary” refer to Q2Power Corp., a Delaware corporation, our subsidiary and former operating company.
 
Organizational History and Merger with Q2P
 
The Company, formerly known as Anpath Group, Inc. (“Anpath”), was organized pursuant of the laws of the State of Delaware on August 26, 2004. On November 12, 2015, the Company, its newly formed and wholly-owned subsidiary, AnPath Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Subsidiary”), and Q2P consummated an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), resulting in the Merger Subsidiary merging with and into Q2P. As a result, Q2P was the surviving company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of AnPath (the “Merger”).
 
As a result of the Merger, all outstanding shares of Q2P were exchanged for approximately 24 million shares of the Company’s common stock, and the Company assumed both the Q2P 2014 Founders Stock Option Plan and the 2014 Employees Stock Option Plan (the “Option Plans”). Also pursuant to the Merger, the officers and directors of Q2P took over the management and Board of Directors of the Company. In connection with the Merger, the Company sold the former operating entity of Anpath, ESI, to three former officers and shareholders of Anpath in exchange for the return of 470,560 shares of common stock of the Company and ESI retaining all of the old liabilities of ESI including a litigation judgment.
 
In December 2015, the Company officially changed its name to Q2Power Technologies, Inc. to reflect the new business direction of the Company after the Merger – that of Q2P, namely the development of waste-to-power systems. In February 2016, the Company changed its fiscal year end from March 31 to December 31 to reflect the year-end of its operating Subsidiary, and up-listed its common stock to the OTCQB. The financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements reflect this change of fiscal year end.
 
In August 2017, the Company sold its waste-to-power technology to a licensee and re-focused its efforts and resources to the pursuit of acquisitions and management of companies and assets in the business of compost and soil manufacturing. This business model arose from the work the Company was doing with wastewater treatment plants through Q2P and other external factors which led our Board to believe such opportunities would present the most beneficial path forward for the Company and its shareholders. In June 2017, the Company changed its name to Q2Earth, Inc. to better reflect its new business model.
 
Prior Waste-to-Power Business
 
Q2P was originally formed as a Florida limited liability company by Cyclone Power Technologies, Inc. (“Cyclone”) to pursue development and commercialization of its patented waste heat recovery engine. In July 2014, Q2P commenced operations as an independent company after receiving its initial round of funding and signing a formal Separation Agreement with Cyclone. From then until the end of 2016, the business of the Company was the development of waste-to-power systems based on technology licensed from Cyclone.
 
Q2P’s prime target market for its waste-to-power technology (the “Q2P Technology”) was small-scale Waste Water Treatment Plants (“WWTPs”), whereby the Q2P Technology could capture methane produced from the WWTPs and convert it into power and usable heat. The Q2P Technology was comprised of our unique external heat engine (the “Q2P Engine”) as well as waste fuel burners, controls and other subcomponents (collectively with the Q2P Engine, referred to as a “CHP System”). We developed the CHP System from proof-of-concept to a working “pilot stage” product between 2014 and 2015.

Our pilot program operated in central Ohio for approximately six months, during which time we collected significant information about the technology itself, and the operations and cost structures of WWTPs generally. A large portion of a WWTP’s operating expenditures are spent removing the residual sludge (called “biosolids”) from digesters, the vast portion of which is either combusted, landfilled or applied directly to the land. Technologies and processes that can convert biosolids to other useful products such as compost and engineered soils, we determined, could provide additional value to agricultural and construction sector customers and new revenue streams for this waste value chain. In mid-2016, along with the addition of two new Board of Director members with vast experience in the waste water, biosolids and waste recycling sectors, the Company started pursuing synergistic alliances with companies that have assets, technology and business networks for the manufacturing and sale of such beneficial re-use products. This led us to the composting industry.
 
Current Business Model: Compost and Engineered Soils
 
Overview. According to the U.S Composting Council (the “USCC”), one-third of the world’s arable land has been lost to soil erosion. In the United States, 99 million acres (28% of all cropland) are eroding above soil tolerance rates, meaning the long-term productivity of the soil cannot be maintained and new soil is not adequately replacing the lost soil. This erosion reduces the ability of the soil to support plant growth and store water, making food production more difficult, reducing the earth’s ability to filter out carbon and produce oxygen, and adding significant pressure on water resources.
 
Management believes that soil health may be one of the most important issues facing our planet, affecting the food we eat, water we drink, and air we breathe. Composting is a critical process for recycling organic wastes for beneficial uses to replenish top soil, conserve water and reduce pollution. According to the USCC, composting further protects our climate by sequestering carbon in the soil and reducing methane production from landfills by reducing the volume of organic wastes disposed in this manner.
 
The composting industry is highly fragmented, comprised of over 5,000 facilities throughout the United States, most of which are small in size and supply varying product qualities. An estimated $5.6 billion in compost is sold annually in the United States, according to the USCC, but less than 10% of farms nationwide currently utilize compost to supplement top soil and reduce chemical and water requirements. New applications for compost such as engineered soils used in general construction, infrastructure projects, land reclamation, sod and turf farms and other green landscape projects are creating additional business opportunities globally.
 
One of the most compelling business aspects of the compost industry in management’s opinion is the trend among certain facilities to view their business less as simply a waste management solution (making money through “tipping fees” – i.e., the fees paid to take waste), and more as a manufacturing process to produce higher end compost and soil products that can be sold at higher margins and have greater beneficial uses for our planet.
 
We also believe that the composting industry in the United States is prime for consolidation, operational and technological efficiency improvements, and comprehensive sales and marketing strategies to increase demand and usage. We have a plan in place to build the Company over the next years by acquiring or overseeing the acquisition and management of strategic compost facilities, developing new distribution channels and product brands, investing in science and technology that support the industry and lead to more widespread usage, and implementing best operating practices and efficiency programs to foster growth and create value.
 
Acquisition and Funding Structure. Our business involves acquiring or overseeing the acquisition of companies in the compost and soils sector, as well as the operational management of those assets. This acquisition strategy, as well as the funding required to consummate these transactions, is currently being conducted through Earth Property Holdings, LLC (“EPH”), a Delaware limited liability company in which we hold a minority equity interest and an eight-year agreement to oversee and manage all of its operations. See “Management Agreement” below.
 
Through EPH we have completed two acquisitions to date: George B. Wittmer Associates Inc. (“GBWA”), based in Jacksonville, Florida in November 2018, and Employee Owned Nursery Enterprises Ltd., d/b/a Organics by Gosh (“OBG”), based in Austin, Texas in January 2019. See “Acquired Facilities” below.
 
Management Agreement. Our agreement to manage the operations of EPH (the “Management Agreement”) provides an eight-year term and an annual fee starting at $200,000; however, upon the closing of the GBWA and OBG acquisitions, we received a total of $700,000 in management fees in 2018 and January 2019 which will be earned by us over the 2019 fiscal year. We expect fees to increase as we have more assets under management, but such increase is not guaranteed. The Management Agreement can be terminated by the board of directors of EPH which is controlled by the Class A Unit holders, the equity investors in EPH. If we are terminated by EPH without cause, we would receive a severance payment equal to one-year of management fees plus any accrued management fees to the date of termination. If we are terminated by EPH with cause, we would receive any accrued management fees only.

The Management Agreement provides EPH with a first right of refusal for prospective acquisitions of compost manufacturing companies and facilities; but allows us to pursue such deals if rejected by EPH’s board. Further the agreement allows us to pursue independently agreements, licenses or acquisitions related to soil marketing and distribution outside the geographic markets of EPH facilities, new product and brand development, and soil science research (the “Q2 Activities”). Management believes these Q2 Activities can be supportive of the EPH facilities we manage as well as provide additional revenue streams at the Company level and value creation for our shareholders. To date, we have not yet commenced any material Q2 Activities, but plan to start building this side of our business in 2019.
 
LLC Agreement. EPH is governed by a Limited Liability Company Agreement (the “LLC Agreement”), which sets forth the relative rights of its members. Most importantly, EPH has two outstanding classes of membership units: Class A Units, which provide its holders with an 8% preferred annual distribution; and Class B Units, which share in the profits and liquidation value of EPH after the Class A Unit holders have received a return of their preferred distributions and capital investments. The Class A Unit holders have the right to nominate two of three EPH Board of Director members, who have ultimate authority over material decisions effecting that company. The LLC Agreement also provides restrictions on transfer of units, drag-along/tag-along rights, pre-emptive rights for new issuances, and other terms and rights that are fairly standard in agreements of this nature.
 
There are currently 715,909 Class A Units outstanding held by four investors representing 80.1% of the voting power of EPH, and 178,969 Class B Units outstanding all held by the Company and representing 19.9% of the voting power of EPH. There are also 100,000 Class C Units authorized but not issued. These Class C Units are non-voting, but allow the holders to share in profit distributions and liquidation value on par with the Class B Units. Two EPH equity members who are affiliated with each other also have warrants to acquire up to 14,610 additional Class A Units in EPH before March 2025 for $0.01 per Unit.
 
Equity Funding. In connection with the closing of the GBWA acquisition, EPH issued 500,000 Class A Units to one institutional investor for $4,400,000. Concurrently, EPH issued to the Company 124,999 Class B Units for $50,000 and the transfer to EPH of the GBWA agreement and future compost facility acquisition rights under a Transfer Agreement. In connection with the closing of OBG, EPH issued an additional 215,909 Class A Units to the same institutional investor and three other investors for $1,900,000, and the Company acquired 53,970 more Class B Units for $21,588.
 
Debt Funding. In connection with the OBG transaction, EPH closed a $6 million mezzanine debt facility (the “Mezzanine Debt”), under which it drew down $3 million and reserved $3 million for future acquisitions. The Company is neither a borrower nor guarantor under the Mezzanine Debt agreements.
 
Bridge Financing. The Company issued a total of $2,821,908 in Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Bridge Notes”) during 2017 and 2018 (the “Bridge Offering”). Proceeds from the Bridge Notes were used to diligence, negotiate and secure the initial compost acquisitions, as well as for operational expenses and legacy debt repayment. The Bridge Notes convert at a 50% discount to the post-funding valuation of the Company at the closing of its next offering in the minimum amount of $5,000,000 (the “Equity Offering”). The conversion valuation has a ceiling of $12,000,000, and a “floor” company value of $6,000,000 in the event there is no Equity Offering before the Bridge Notes are able to be converted. The Bridge Notes convert into common stock, or preferred stock if received by investors in the Equity Offering, commencing on the soonest of the Equity Offering closing or December 31, 2017, at the discretion of the holder. $50,000 of the Bridge Notes were converted to common stock in 2018. Maturity is 36 months from issuance (except for certain Bridge Notes issued in 2018, which have a 24-month term) with 15% annual compounded interest which is capitalized each year into the principal of the Notes and paid in kind. There are no warrants issued in connection with the Bridge Offering.


Future Financing. Management is currently working on securing the next round of funding for EPH needed to close future acquisitions. We are also considering capital raises for the Company, which would allow us to better pursue Q2 Activities such as soil brand acquisition, distribution channels, soil science and technology, and other similar value creation opportunities. Management can make no guaranty that such financing can be completed on terms acceptable to either EPH or the Company if at all, or that such Q2 Activities leading to additional value creation for Company shareholders can be consummated.

Acquired Facilities
 
In November 2018 and January 2019 respectively, the Company through EPH completed two acquisitions in the compost and environmental services space. EPH is an unconsolidated equity method investment for the Company; and therefore, the results of operations, balance sheets, and other material aspects of the business of EPH and the acquired companies are not presented in our financial statements or included in current reports or exhibits thereto. The following are summaries of the business of GBWA and OBG.


GBWA, based in Callahan, FL, recycles hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of industrial discard streams and supplies millions of pounds of compost, soil amendments, soil blends, and potting soil materials to the agriculture and horticulture markets annually. Through long term environmental management contracts with large papermills in Florida, Georgia and Alabama, GBWA recovers, reconditions, processes and ships residual streams such as wood ash, precipitated carbonates, flume grit, wood yard waste, off-specification boiler fuel solids, stockpiled bark, and other materials previously landfilled. GBWA eliminates waste stream management, handling, storage and liability by transforming industrial residual streams into commodities for use by other industries.
 
OBG, based in Austin, Texas, is a leading organics recycler and compost manufacturer, receiving yard trimmings and wasted food from over half of the homes and almost a third of the restaurants and commercial food preparers in the Austin area. The company produces high quality compost, blended soils and other products, which they sell in over a million bags per year through major retailers and in bulk to landscapers and contractors throughout central Texas.
 
Through our Management Agreement, we oversee all of the operations of GBWA and OBG, including sales, manufacturing, permitting and legal, accounting, staffing, business development and other areas of their respective businesses. We believe that we can implement processes, practices and systems that can make the operations of these companies more efficient and profitable; and pursue strategies to expand their business within and beyond their current territories. Through EPH, we are also seeking additional acquisition opportunities in Florida, Texas, Georgia, North Carolina and other areas throughout the Southeast and Southwest.
 
Business of Compost and Soils
 
Tipping Fees. The business of composting has historically been driven by tipping fees – the amount paid to the compost facility to haul and/or receive waste products. In the case of biosolids received from WWTPs, tipping fees can range from $35 to $80 per ton or more based on location and hauling distance. In the case of yard or “green” waste, these fees are significantly less, ranging from $4 per ton to $8 per ton, but also vary based on location, hauling distance, type of plant waste, and other factors. Food waste tipping fees are usually higher than green waste and less than biosolids. A medium to large compost facility may accept between 50,000 and 200,000 tons of waste per year.
 
Manufacturing. There are several processes for manufacturing compost that are accepted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and state regulators. The two most common are “static pile” and “windrowing”. Using the static pile method, ground-up feedstock is formed into large piles and “cured” for periods of at least 12 months (which can be accelerated by different forced air procedures). During this process, the waste materials breakdown in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The windrowing process involves positioning ground-up feedstock into long rows that are mechanically turned every few days and can produce a final product in as little as one to three months. In both static pile and windrowing, there are time and temperature thresholds to create an EPA approved compost.
 
The compost manufacturing method employed by different facilities depends on may factors such as feedstock used, space requirements, environmental conditions, and desired end product. Both GBWA and OBG currently use a static pile method, but we may consider windrowing in future applications which can allow for greater inventory turn-over and more consistent end-products, but requires additional equipment and space.

Manufacturing compost is a capital intensive process, requiring equipment such as grinders, screeners, turners, excavators and other heavy machinery. Maintaining equipment in good working condition is critical to proper operations, and equipment downtime can materially affect financial performance.
 
Product Sales. For many compost facilities, margins made on tipping fees drive their business model and little effort or expense is incurred on producing a quality, consistent end product. For these facilities, limited additional revenue and margin is made on the back end – at times only about 10% to 20% of their revenue is from soil sales. Such facilities may even give away product to landfills for daily cover or sell it to farmers at prices that cover transportation costs.
 
As mentioned above, one of the most compelling aspects of the compost industry is the trend among certain facilities to view their business less as a waste management solution and more as a manufacturing process to produce higher end compost and soil products. Management believes this is a fundamental transition in thinking about operations, procedures and priorities. Those facilities that have made the transition to focus on end product may have higher production costs to assure consistency of feedstock, better manufacturing procedures, and greater marketing costs, but the financial benefits can be material. Whereas average lower quality compost may sell for $4/cubic yard, high quality products can fetch much higher prices – between $12/cubic yard and $80/cubic yard for the top-end blended soil products.


Compost can be sold as a stand-alone product or used a base material for soil blends. For instance, potting soil purchased in a nursery or “big box” retailers may contain 20% to 30% compost blended with other materials such as top soil, bark or peat. Compost is also used as a base material for “engineered” soils in large landscaping and construction projects. In these applications, compost manufacturers will blend their compost to meet specifications of the contractor that include organic content, weight, water retention, compactibility and other necessary qualities. Such soil blends can sell for the higher range in the market.
 
The market for compost and soils is localized, limited in large part by the cost of transporting materials. Typically, shipping material over 100 miles from its place of manufacturing becomes less economical. As a result, the larger compost manufacturers will create a dominant presence in their community, and expand their business by offering a broader range of products, better service to both inbound and outbound customers, and identifiable brands that can then be scaled to other markets.
 
Business Plan and Value Appreciation Strategy
 
Our business involves acquiring or overseeing the acquisition of compost and soil manufacturing facilities through EPH, and managing those facilities through a long-term agreement. We believe that by creating a regional or, ultimately, nationwide footprint of composting facilities that can produce consistent, quality products, combined with strong sales, marketing/branding and scientific research, we can create substantial added value from these acquired assets.
 
Through this strategy, value to the Company’s shareholders can be achieved in several ways. Most directly, both acquisitions and organic growth at the EPH level can lead to higher fees paid to us through our Management Agreement and equity appreciation from our investment in EPH. Possibly more importantly, however, the intellectual property that we develop through these managerial activities – understanding, creating and scaling the best operating practices, systems and processes for compost and soil manufacturing – has potential to generate revenue and fees for the Company beyond just EPH owned facilities. Further, investment or acquisitions at the Company level in brands and new product development, non-traditional sales and marketing channels, and soil science research, may provide “asset and capital light” opportunities to expand our reach nationally and internationally.
 
Product Focus. As discussed above, we plan to achieve growth for the facilities we manage by maximizing sales of high-end compost and soils through a network of traditional and new distribution channels. Part of this strategy would include transitioning facilities that are more reliant on tipping fees to better manufacturing processes that can achieve higher quality products. For those facilities that already have these procedures in place, we plan to introduce into their regional markets new branded and blended soil products that command higher prices and margins and are supported by sound scientific research. Such product and brand development and scientific studies may be provided through the Q2 Activities, created and controlled directly by the Company.

Sales Channels/Distribution. We will seek to develop nationwide marketing and sales channels with large corporate customers, government agencies, and other groups. Marketing is a major component of compost sales that seems to be lacking in the industry, but can result in product differentiation, consumer identification and value creation by opening new customer bases. The engineered soils market is generally in its early growth stages. We believe there are substantial opportunities to promote these products for construction, federal/municipal infrastructure programs, and land reclamation/mining projects. We plan to invest in sales and marketing at the Company level to attract nationwide customers that can benefit from and place large orders for compost and engineered soils both from EPH owned facilities and other facilities with which the Company may partner in the future.
 
Efficiencies. We expect that consolidating composting companies can lead to better operational and sales efficiencies. Activities such as safety, accounting, legal, advertising, government outreach, training and others can be done at the corporate level, thus reducing overlapping personnel and efforts. Under our Management Agreement with EPH, these are the duties of the Company. We believe that the proprietary knowledge and intellectual property that we develop in this management role can also be applied to facilities not owned by EPH. In this respect, the Company can develop a management system of controls, procedures and other best operating practices that can be licensed or contracted by other companies.
 
Moving forward, we intend to pursue these and other opportunities based on the overall mission of doing good for our planet by reducing waste, toxic chemical usage and pollution, while supporting food supply and security.
 
Composting Industry
 
Size and Composition. According to research conducted by the USCC, there are approximately 5,000 commercial composters in the United States diverting an estimated 19.4 million tons of organics from landfills. These organic waste streams primarily consist of yard trimmings, food scraps, biosolids (from waste water treatment plants) and some agricultural waste streams, including manure.
 
Of the approximately 5,000 composting sites in the U.S., most are small producers generating under $1 million per year in revenue. Less than 400 composters in the U.S., by the Company’s count based on industry data, generate more than $5 million in revenue per year, and even fewer over $10 million.
 
Compost manufacturers can also be segmented by the types of waste they collect for processing. The three main feedstocks are biosolids from WWTPs, yard (or “green”) waste from commercial or municipal waste collection firms, and pre or post-consumer food waste. The largest number of composters utilize green waste, however, the largest volume of compost in the U.S. comes from biosolids.
 
Applications/Sectors for Compost Sales. The applications for compost and engineered soils are wide and growing. Engineered soils (sometimes called manufactured soils) are blends of soil, soil components and soil-like material used in horticulture, landscape, construction and site restoration applications. Using engineered soils allows for “tailoring” of soil properties to specific needs. Soil blending is performed at a production scale across the U.S., generating millions of cubic yards of product annually. Compost is a primary component of engineered soils, typically comprising 1/3 of its volume.
 
The largest segments for the application of compost and engineered soils include the following:
 
Agriculture. Making farmland more productive and sustainable is the largest application of compost. Compost improves infiltration rates, water holding capacity and soil tilth; and fertilizes the soil to supplement nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Use of compost can save farmers money by decreasing water, chemical fertilizer and pesticide uses by up to 80%. Despite the utilization of compost on farmland being an age-old practice, the market for this in the U.S. is still largely untapped, estimated at only a 10% utilization rate relative to all farmable land, according to the USCC.
 
Horticulture. The next largest segment of the market is landscaping and gardening (horticulture), which includes customers ranging from commercial landscapers who buy compost, soil and mulch products in bulk, to the home gardener who buys these products in bags at nurseries and big box retailers. The home gardener is a very interesting segment of this group. Concerns surrounding the use of synthetic chemicals on lawns, gardens and the food we eat are creating a growing demand for environmentally friendly, organic based products to replace fertilizers and pesticides. Compost is a natural alternative to synthetic chemicals, and we believe as more consumers are educated about the benefits of using compost, demand for these products will grow.

Construction: For both traditional construction and LEED certified projects, use of engineered soils for control of erosion, water retention, sedimentation and pollution can result in cost savings and easier compliance with permitting. Further, Low Impact Development (LID) approaches – maintaining and enhancing pre-development watershed regimes – have become critically important, especially in urban settings. Engineered soils play a major role in green roofs, bio-retention cells, rain gardens, infiltration trenches and open grid pavement systems. The goals of these systems are to reduce the flow rate, volume and contaminant level of storm water runoff (compost can retain 20X its weight in water).
 
Silviculture and Land Reclamation (Mining): Engineered soils are being used to repopulate forests (silviculture) and other land where heavy use, industry or other activities such as mining have decimated the vegetation. This is an important area to help control water conservation and climate change.
 
Sod and Turf: Engineered soils are being used to improve sod and turf quality, produce a lighter material, and enhance growth efficiency. They are being used for college and high school athletic fields (especially to replace synthetic turf fields), and for golf course construction and maintenance.
 
Competition
 
The composting industry is highly fragmented with no clear leader on a national basis. As composting is very much a localized business constrained by the costs of transporting soils over long distances, each region or community that we may enter will likely have a dominant market player. We view these local leaders as potential acquisition targets or partners; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire or build a dominant business in each location we choose to enter.
 
Large waste companies own compost facilities in their respective portfolios. Waste Management in particular owns over 40 compost facilities, typically connected to a landfill property. We believe that compost sites like these are under-utilized and not geared to creating the highest value end-products for sale into multiple markets. As a result, we believe there is an opportunity to work with large waste companies to help them expand their sales and marketing operations.
 
The largest buyers of compost and soil products nationwide are aggregators such as Scotts Miracle-Gro and Old Castle. These companies typically purchase material from companies like those we manage, bag and brand the material, and sell it through big box retailers including Home Depot and Lowe’s. These aggregators are both customers and competitors of our current and future facilities, as they control important distribution channels and consumer identifiable brands. These companies also have far greater resources that we do.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Compost. With respect to the Company’s composting business model, we do not hold any specific intellectual property; however, certain of the companies acquired through EPH, or identified for future acquisition or partnership, do have trade secrets in soil formulas, manufacturing processes, and patentable compost additives, all of which could be valuable for our on-going growth strategy. The companies that we manage have certain local or industry-specific product brands and service marks that have value. We will seek to protect and further monetize this intellectual property on behalf of EPH under our Management Agreement.
 
Engine Development. On August 8, 2017, the Company sold the intellectual property developed in connection with the Q2P Engine and the CHP System to Phoenix Power Group. This intellectual property consisted of designs, drawings, manufacturing processes, and potentially patentable technology, as well as a license agreement with Cyclone Power Technologies.
 
Patents. The Company currently does not hold any patents.

Trade Secrets. With respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on among other things, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests. We also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans.
 
Trademarks. We have received approval from the USPTO for use of our Q2P and Q2Power trademarks. We acquired from Cyclone the U.S. trademarks for “WHE”, WHE Generation” and “Generation WHE” in connection with our Separation Agreement. The Company is not currently using any of these marks.
 
Government Regulation
 
Generally, individual states determine the regulatory process for composting operations and oversee the permitting, siting, design and operations requirements. Federal regulations through the EPA generally apply for facilities handling biosolids, and in some states, animal manures. In cases where the state has not established requirements specifically for composting source separated organics or other mixed feedstocks, the state may defer back to the federal biosolids regulations. Typically, the pollutant limits and pathogen and vector attraction reduction processes are utilized.
 
Even with regulations in place at the state level, local planning and zoning requirements are important for composting facilities as well. These requirements are often cumbersome to navigate due to outdated laws, lack of familiarity with composting processes and conflicting community priorities. Facilities often must meet local requirements before receiving a permit to operate from the state.
 
Composting is often not recognized as a traditional land use designation and may be classified as an industrial, rather than an agricultural, activity. This designation can burden composters with excessive regulations. Local land use rules may also require compliance with criteria that is already covered by state rules. This creates both a financial and regulatory burden to the processor.
 
Composting regulations typically address concerns over litter, leachate, odor, vectors, dust, noise, security against illegal dumping, protection of surface and groundwater, neighborhood compatibility and pathogen and metal levels in the finished product. Requirements for yard waste composting tend to be much more lenient than those for food waste because of the reduced risk of leachate, odors, vectors and pathogens, generally leading to decreased feelings of “Not In My Back Yard” (NIMBYism). Some state regulations facilitate composting of source separated organics (SSO), based on type (e.g., vegetative only with no meat, preconsumer) and quantity (e.g., <500 cy at any one time). In these cases, less onerous and less costly permits may be available. Typically, composting facilities seeking to process larger quantities and/or a wide range of types of SSO (e.g., vegetative and meat/dairy as well as postconsumer, such as plate scrapings) need to apply for a more complex and costly permit.
 
In addition to governmental oversight of compost operations, certain self-governed organizations such as the US Composting Council through its Seal of Testing Assurance Program (“STA”) and OMRI, which certifies organic products, may apply to our products. STA, for instance, is a compost testing, labeling and information disclosure program created in 2000 through the consensus of leading compost research scientists in the United States. STA is not mandatory in the industry, but if a facility chooses to work within its standards, it requires continuous third-party lab testing and reporting of compost samples which can be costly. The benefits of this program include differentiation of qualifying compost in the marketplace.
 
Exchange Act
 
We are subject to the following regulations of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and applicable securities laws, rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act by the SEC. Compliance with these requirements of the Exchange Act increases our legal and accounting costs.

Smaller Reporting Company
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act, and subject to the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K of the SEC, as a “smaller reporting company.” That designation will relieve us of some of the informational requirements of Regulation S-K.

We are also an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or “JOBS Act.” As long as we remain an “emerging growth company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not an “emerging growth company,” like those applicable to a “smaller reporting company,” including, but not limited to, a scaled down description of our business in SEC filings; no requirements to include risk factors in Exchange Act filings; no requirement to include certain selected financial data and supplementary financial information in SEC filings; not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements that we file under the Exchange Act; no requirement for Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b) auditor attestations of internal control over financial reporting; and exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and seeking nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We are also only required to file audited financial statements for the previous two fiscal years when filing registration statements, together with reviewed financial statements of any applicable subsequent quarter.
 
We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” We can remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years. We would cease to be an “emerging growth company” prior to such time if we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more and when we become a “larger accelerated filer,” have a public float of $700 million or more or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.
 
Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 
Sarbanes/Oxley Act
 
Except for the limitations excluded by the JOBS Act discussed under the preceding heading “Emerging Growth Company,” we are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes/Oxley Act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthens auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; management assessment of our internal controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes/Oxley Act will substantially increase our legal and accounting costs.
 
Exchange Act Reporting Requirements
 
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, like we are, to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to shareholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our shareholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A (where proxies are solicited) or 14C (where consents in writing to the action have already been received or anticipated to be received) of Regulation 14, as applicable; and preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to our shareholders.
 
We are also required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and will be required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
