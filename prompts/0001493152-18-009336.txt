ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW 
 
The Singing Machine Company, Inc., (“Company,” “Singing Machine,” “we,” “us,” or, “our”) is engaged in the development, production, marketing and distribution of consumer karaoke audio equipment, toy products, accessories, music, and audio consumer electronic products. We contract for the manufacturing of all our electronic equipment products with factories located in China. We have also collaborated with a music content service provider that allows the Company to offer karaoke downloads, and streaming subscription services. This collaboration provides the Company with a distribution platform for digital music sales and subscriptions and furthermore it opens up the Company’s music sales to customers who purchase our competitors’ karaoke machines as well. The capabilities of the Company’s music distribution system include the ability to download or stream selections from this content library, creating the opportunity to open new revenue sources through the sale of subscriptions.

We were incorporated in California in 1982. We originally sold our products exclusively to professional and semi-professional singers. In 1988, we began marketing karaoke equipment for home use. We believe we are the first company to introduce the home karaoke products to the United States (“U.S.”). In May 1994, we merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in Delaware with the same name. As a result of that merger the Delaware corporation became the successor to the business and operations of the California corporation and retained the name The Singing Machine Company, Inc. (“SMC”). In December 2005, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary SMC (Comercial Offshore De Macau) Limitada in Macau, China (“SMC Macau” or “Macau subsidiary”), to provide sales, financing, shipping, engineering and sourcing support for Singing Machine and Subsidiaries. Our Macau subsidiary has been approved to operate its business in Macau as Macau Offshore Company (MOC) and is exempt for the Macau corporate income tax. In February 2008, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary SMC Logistics, Inc. (“SMC-L”), a California corporation, to manage the U.S. domestic logistics and fulfillment warehouse servicing for the Company and in April 2008 a wholly-owned subsidiary, SMC Music, Inc. (“SMC-M”) to contract with third party music providers. The Company trades on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board (“OTCQX”) under the symbol “SMDM”. Our principal executive offices are located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
 
China Sinostar Group Company Limited holds 100% of the common stock of koncepts International Limited (“koncepts”). Koncepts is a major shareholder of the Company, owning approximately 49% of our shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis as of March 31, 2018. Sinostar is a company whose principal activities include designing, manufacturing and selling electronic products through its various subsidiaries. We do business with a number of entities that are indirectly wholly-owned or majority owned subsidiaries of Sinostar, including Starlight R&D Ltd (“Starlight R&D”), Starlight Consumer Electronics USA, Inc., (“SCE”), Cosmo Communications Corporation of Canada, Inc. (“Cosmo”) and Star Light Electronics Company Ltd (Starlite), among others (Sinostar and its subsidiaries collectively referred to herein as the “Sinostar Group” or “Sinostar”). The Company is also partly held by Treasure Green Holdings Ltd. (“Treasure Green”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Sinostar, owning approximately 2% of our common stock. In total, the Sinostar Group owns approximately 51% of the Company’s shares of common stock.
 
GROWTH STRATEGY
 
The overall objective of the Singing Machine is to create an efficient platform for the development, manufacture, and world-wide marketing and distribution of home entertainment based consumer electronics. The Company will also seek new revenue opportunities through hardware-based music content delivery and the creation of a community based entertainment platform. The Company intends to leverage our valuable customer base and strong relationships with our factories to achieve our organic growth initiatives.
Organic Growth Strategy
 
We intend to pursue various initiatives to execute our organic growth strategy which is designed to enhance our market presence, expand our customer base and be an industry leader in new product development. Key elements of our organic growth strategy include:
 
Toy Products. Historically karaoke has been our core business. The Singing Machine brand is widely recognized as a leader in karaoke and consequently we hold a dominant market share in the business. While consistently a market leader, the Company has determined that it needs to diversify and expand its core focus in order to grow its business. The Company has therefore refocused its self-perception and is determined to build on its success by defining ourselves as a provider of quality home entertainment – not just home karaoke hardware. Critical to this strategy, the Company has launched a new line of toy products branded SMC Kids. We intend to grow a new line of sing-along music themed toy products at lower opening price points and we are also exploring a sub-line of educational themed learning products. We believe this toy line, if successful, can leverage existing relationships with our current retail partners and help the Company organically grow.
 
Develop Karaoke Hardware That Interfaces With Our Digital Music Store. Streaming music is one of the fastest growing areas in the music industry. We believe that the future of karaoke music distribution is through legal mediums of internet streaming and download sites (e.g. iTunes, Amazon, etc). Since karaoke music only accounts for a small percentage of total music business, retailers usually only offer a limited selection of karaoke products. Thus, it is difficult for customers to find karaoke music in retail outlets, especially for the songs they enjoy. The benefits to the Company are multifaceted including the opportunity to: offer downloadable music which means less physical inventory for the Company and our retail customers to carry; reduce financial return risk since a downloaded piece of karaoke music is not returnable; make available increased marketing opportunities by offering downloads for those who sign up and provide their contact information enabling the Company to create future marketing and advertising campaigns; create an opportunity to sell our karaoke music to not only our customers but also to owners of our competitors’ machines (new and old); create cross-promotions with our retail-customers by giving away music downloads to purchasers of karaoke machines as an incentive to sell more machines.
 
We believe that by tightly integrating our karaoke machine products with access to music content such as Electronic Downloads, Streaming Media, Community Performance Hosting, and by creating quality, wholesome, home entertainment for the entire family we will not only sell more products, we will find new sources of revenue. Using our existing key relationships with our customers and factories, and by adding new relationships with key content providers, we believe we can achieve more top-line growth by utilizing these relationships to design and distribute a more diversified line of karaoke products.
 
Focus On International Growth. We believe that we have the most recognized and trusted brand in the world for consumer karaoke. We also have the most karaoke product offerings and features of any of our competitors in the karaoke market. We have been and will continue aggressively pursuing international business outside of North America to capture a vastly untapped market for home karaoke. The Company’s early efforts to open up new international markets has been successful. Through economies of scale and financed on a direct import basis, we believe this is one of the major areas in which we can substantially increase our revenues.

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Download Karaoke Machines represent a new line of digital karaoke machines launching in Fiscal 2016. These machines include custom proprietary software to play high-definition digital downloaded content from our Singing Machine download store. These machines offer a full range of features including searching, playlist creation, Bluetooth, full motion videos, lead vocal, and HDMI output. The retail price range is from $79 to $199. This product line accounted for approximately 21% of total revenue in fiscal 2018. 
● | Streaming Karaoke Machines represent a new line of digital karaoke machines that connect to a karaoke library to stream high-definition karaoke videos directly to the machine. These machines use Wi-Fi to stream songs from a library of karaoke music, accessible on a subscription model. The Company is concentrating on Streaming Karaoke Hardware for a fiscal 2019 launch. This product line accounted for 0% of total revenue in fiscal 2018.

These toy products will range from sing-along music players to educational themed learning toys. The retail price range is from $19.99 to $39.99. This product line accounted for 4% of total revenue in fiscal 2018. 

 
The remaining 5% of total revenue was from the sales of karaoke related accessories consisting primarily of microphones, music subscriptions and downloads, and other miscellaneous electronic accessories.
 
MARKETING, SALES 
 
Our karaoke machines and music are sold nationally and internationally to a broad spectrum of customers, primarily through mass merchandisers, department stores, direct mail catalogs and showrooms, music and record stores, national chains, specialty stores and warehouse clubs. Our product lines are currently sold by the following retailers, among others: Costco, Target, Sam’s Club, Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Amazon.com. Our sales strategy includes offering domestic sales as well as direct import sales made direct to the customer.
 
Domestic Sales. Our strategy of selling products from a domestic warehouse enables us to provide timely delivery and serve as a domestic supplier of imported goods. We purchase karaoke machines overseas from factories in China for our own account and warehouse the products in leased facilities in California. We are responsible for costs of shipping, insurance, customs clearance, duties, storage and distribution related to such products and, therefore, domestic sales command higher sales prices than direct sales. We generally sell from our own inventory in less than container-sized lots. Domestic sales also include our new rapidly growing business of e-commerce in which we ship product directly to the end-consumer.
 
Direct Sales. We ship some hardware products sold by us directly to customers from China through SMC Macau. Sales made through our subsidiary are completed by either delivering products to the customers’ common carriers at the shipping point or by shipping the products to the customers’ distribution centers, warehouses, or stores. Direct sales are made in larger quantities (generally container sized lots) to customers worldwide, which pay SMC Macau pursuant to their own international, irrevocable, transferable letters of credit or on open account.
 
In fiscal 2018, approximately 57% of sales revenues were from direct sales and 43% of revenues were domestic sales. Our sales within the U.S. are primarily made by our in-house sales team and our independent sales representatives. Our independent sales representatives are paid a commission based upon sales made in their respective territories. We utilize some of our outside independent sales representatives to help us provide service to our mass merchandisers and other retailers. The sales representative agreements are generally one (1) year agreements, which automatically renew on an annual basis, unless terminated by either party on 30 days’ notice. Our international sales are primarily made by our in-house sales representatives and our independent distributors.
 
As a percentage of net sales, our sales in the aggregate to our five largest customers during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 80% and 79%, respectively. In fiscal 2018, the top three major customers accounted for approximately 34%, 17% and 11% of our net revenues. Although we have long-established relationships with all of our customers, we do not have contractual arrangements to purchase fixed quantities with any of them. A decrease in business or a loss of any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
 
We also market our products at various national and international trade shows each year. We regularly attend the following trade shows and conventions: The Consumer Electronics Show which takes place each January in Las Vegas; the American Toy Fair which occurs each February in New York and the Hong Kong Electronics Show stages each October in Hong Kong.

We believe the Singing Machine brand is one of the most widely recognized karaoke brands in the United States and Europe. While we continue to heavily focus on our core karaoke business, we wish to expand our business into other product categories. Our strong product procurement team in Hong Kong and China combined with our experienced sales and service team in North America enables us to compete not only in the karaoke market but also in other markets, such as musical instruments, licensed toy products and other consumer electronics products.
 
RETURNS 
 
Returns of electronic hardware and music products by our customers generally occur after approval involving damaged goods or goods shipped in error. Our policy is to give credit to our customers for the returns in conjunction with the receipt of new replacement purchase orders. Our total returns represented 6.0% and 6.8% of our net sales in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease of 0.8% in return rate compared to prior fiscal years is due primarily to improved quality in goods manufactured.
DISTRIBUTION 
 
We distribute hardware products to retailers and wholesale distributors through two methods: shipment of products from inventory held at our warehouse facilities in California (domestic sales), shipments directly through our Macau subsidiary, and manufacturers in China of products (direct sales). Domestic sales are made to customers located throughout North America from inventories maintained at our warehouse facilities in California. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, approximately 43% of our sales were sales from our domestic warehouses (“Domestic Sales”) and 57% were sales shipped directly from China (“Direct Sales”).
MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCTION 
 
Our karaoke machines are manufactured and assembled by third parties pursuant to design specifications provided by us. Currently, we have ongoing relationships with six factories, located in Guangdong Province of the People’s Republic of China, which assemble our karaoke machines. During fiscal 2019, we anticipate that 100% of our karaoke products will be produced by these factories, who have verbally agreed to extend financing to us. We believe that the manufacturing capacity of our factories is adequate to meet the demands for our products in fiscal year 2019. However, if our primary factory in China was prevented from manufacturing and delivering our karaoke products, our operation would be severely disrupted until alternative sources of supply are located. In manufacturing our karaoke related products, these factories use molds and certain other tooling, most of which are owned by us. Our products contain electronic components manufactured by other companies such as Panasonic, Sanyo, Toshiba, and Sony. Our manufacturers purchase and install these electronic components in our karaoke machines and related products. The finished products are packaged and labeled under our trademark, The Singing Machine(R) and private labels.
 
While our equipment manufacturers purchase our supplies from a small number of large suppliers, all of the electronic components and raw materials used by us are available from several sources of supply. We depend on limited suppliers for some key components and the loss of any single supplier may have a material long-term adverse effect on our business, operations, or financial condition. To ensure that our high standards of product quality are met and that factories consistently meet our shipping schedules, we utilize Hong Kong and China based employees as our representatives. These employees include product inspectors who are knowledgeable about product specifications and work closely with the factories to verify that such specifications are met. Additionally, key personnel frequently visit our factories for quality assurance and to support good working relationships.
 
All of the electronic equipment sold by us is warrantied to the end user against manufacturing defects for a period of ninety (90) days for labor and parts. All music sold is similarly warrantied for a period of 30 days. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, warranty claims have not been material to our results of operations.
 
COMPETITION 
 
Our business is highly competitive. Our major competitors for karaoke machines and related products are GPX, Audiovox, Vivitar, Akai, Ion, Karaoke USA, licensed property karaoke products and other consumer electronics companies. We believe that competition for karaoke machines is based primarily on price, product features, reputation, delivery times, and customer support. We believe that our brand name is well recognized in the industry and helps us compete in the karaoke machine category. Our primary competitors for download or streaming karaoke music are Youtube, Sybersound, Smule, and Karaoke Anywhere. We believe that competition for karaoke music is based primarily on popularity of song titles, price, reputation, and delivery times.
 
In addition, we compete with all other existing forms of entertainment including, but not limited to, motion pictures, video arcade games, home video games, theme parks, nightclubs, television and prerecorded tapes, CD’s, and DVD’s. Our financial position depends, among other things, on our ability to keep pace with changes and developments in the entertainment industry and to respond to the requirements of our customers. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, and operating resources and broader product lines than we do.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS
 
We have obtained registered trademarks for The Singing Machine name and the logo in the U.S. and in the European Union. We have also filed trademark applications in Australia and Hong Kong. We also filed various trademarks for our products. In 2003 we also obtained two U.S. design patents for karaoke machines, patent numbers US D505,960 S and US D524,325 S.
 
Our trademarks are a significant asset because they provide product recognition. We believe that our intellectual property is significantly protected, but there are no assurances that these rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.
 
COPYRIGHTS AND LICENSES 
 
We offer karaoke music through our Singing Machine Karaoke Download Store, Community, and iPhone/iPad App through a partnership with Stingray Digital Group (“Stingray”). Stingray holds all licensing agreements directly with the music publishers and is responsible for all royalty payments. We share a revenue split with Stingray on all karaoke videos streamed or downloaded by our customers. Stingray is the leading multi-platform music service provider in the world, with an estimated 110 million Pay-TV subscribers in 111 countries around the world. Geared towards individuals and businesses alike, the company’s commercial entities include leading digital music and video services Stingray Music, Concert TV and The KARAOKE Channel. Stingray also offers various business solutions, including music and digital display-based solutions through its Stingray Business division.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 
Our karaoke machines must meet the safety standards imposed in various national, state, local, and provincial jurisdictions. Our karaoke machines sold in the U.S. are designed, manufactured and tested to meet the safety standards of Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. (“ULE”) or Electronic Testing Laboratories (“ETL”). In Europe and other foreign countries, our products are manufactured to meet the Consumer Electronics (“CE”) marking requirements. CE marking is a mandatory European product marking and certification system for certain designated products. When affixed to a product and product packaging, CE marking indicates that a particular product complies with all applicable European product safety, health and environmental requirements within the CE marking system. Products complying with CE marking are now accepted to be safe in 28 European countries. However, ULE or ETL certification does not mean that a product complies with the product safety, health and environmental regulations contained in all fifty states in the United States. Therefore, we maintain a quality control program designed to ensure compliance with all applicable U.S. and federal laws pertaining to the sale of our products. Our production and sale of music products is subject to federal copyright laws.
 
The manufacturing operations of our foreign suppliers in China are subject to foreign regulation. China has permanent “normal trade relations” (“NTR”) status under U.S. tariff laws, which provides a favorable category of U.S. import duties. China’s NTR status became permanent on January 1, 2002. This substantially reduces the possibility of China losing its NTR status, which would result in increasing costs for us.
 
SEASONALITY AND SEASONAL FINANCING 
 
Our business is highly seasonal, with consumers making a large percentage of karaoke purchases around the traditional holiday season in our second and third quarter ending September 30 and December 31. These seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times cause risk to our business associated with the underproduction or overproduction of products that do not match consumer demand. Retailers also attempt to manage their inventories more tightly, requiring that we ship products closer to the time that retailers expect to sell the products to consumers. These factors increase the risk that we may not be able to meet demand for certain products at peak demand times, or that our own inventory levels may be adversely affected by the need to pre-build products before orders are placed. As of March 31, 2018, we had inventory of approximately $8.1 million (net of reserves totaling approximately $0.3 million) compared to inventory of approximately $5.4 million as of March 31, 2017 (net of reserves totaling approximately $0.7 million).
 
Our financing of seasonal working capital during Fiscal 2018 was from a Revolving Credit Facility from PNC Bank (“Revolving Credit Facility”) renewed on June 22, 2017 and vendor extended accounts payable terms from certain China manufacturers. The Revolving Credit Facility expires on July 15, 2020.
 
During Fiscal 2019, we plan on financing our inventory purchases by borrowing on our Revolving Credit Facility and using payment terms that have been granted to us by the factories in China.
 
EMPLOYEES 
 
As of June 29, 2018 we employed 39 full-time employees. Two of our employees are located at SMC Macau’s offices and the remaining employees are based in the U.S. Our employees include 3 executive officers, 16 engaged in warehousing and administrative logistics/technical support and 20 in accounting, marketing, sales and administrative functions.
