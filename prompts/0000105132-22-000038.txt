Item 1. Business 
Overview 

WD-40 Company is a global marketing organization dedicated to creating positive lasting memories by developing and selling products that solve problems in workshops, factories and homes around the world. The Company was founded in 1953 and is headquartered in San Diego, California. 

For more than four decades, we sold only one product, WD-40® Multi-Use Product, a maintenance product which acts as a lubricant, rust preventative, penetrant and moisture displacer. Over the last several decades, we have evolved and expanded our product offerings through both research and development activities and through the acquisition of several brands worldwide. As a result, we have built a family of brands and product lines that deliver high quality performance at a good value to our end users. 

We currently market and sell our products in more than 176 countries and territories worldwide primarily through warehouse club stores, hardware stores, automotive parts outlets, industrial distributors and suppliers, mass retail and home center stores, value retailers, grocery stores, online retailers, farm supply, sport retailers, and independent bike dealers. 

Our sales come from two product groups – maintenance products and homecare and cleaning products. Maintenance products are sold worldwide in markets throughout North, Central and South America, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Homecare and cleaning products are sold primarily in North America, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and Australia. 

Our strategic initiatives are the areas where we will continue to focus our time, talent and resources in future periods. Our strategic initiatives include: 
(i) building a business for the future;
(ii) attracting, developing and engaging outstanding tribe members; 
(iii) striving for operational excellence; 
(iv) growing WD-40 Multi-Use Product; 
(v) growing WD-40 Specialist product line; and 
(vi) expanding and supporting portfolio opportunities that help us grow.

Our top priority is to build an enduring business that we will be proud to pass onto the next generation by using our purpose and values as a decision-making filter. Our desired outcome for this top strategic initiative is to further align and integrate our business decisions with Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) factors and considerations. We understand that we cannot achieve this without attracting, developing and engaging outstanding people, whom we refer to collectively as a tribe, that strive for operational excellence daily. The principal driver of our growth continues to be taking the blue and yellow can with the little red top, to new users in global markets. We continue to be focused and committed to innovation and renovation of our products. 


We see innovation and renovation as important factors to the long-term growth of our brands and product lines, and intend to continue to work on future products, product lines, product packaging, and product delivery systems, as well as promotional innovations and renovations in order to expand our product portfolio to help us grow. We are also focused on expanding our current brands in existing markets with new product development. Our product development teams support new product development and current product improvement for our brands. Over the years, our research and development team has made an impact on most of our brands through our innovation activities. Key innovations for our products include, but are not limited to, WD-40 EZ-Reach® Flexible Straw, WD-40 Smart Straw®, WD-40 Trigger Pro®, WD-40 Specialist®, WD-40 BIKE®, 3-IN-ONE RVcare® and 3-IN-ONE® Professional Garage Door Lube.

Our homecare and cleaning products, particularly those in the U.S., are considered harvest brands which continue to provide positive returns, but are becoming a smaller part of the business as sales of the maintenance products grow with the execution of our strategic initiatives. Although we have evaluated strategic alternatives for certain of our homecare and cleaning products, particularly those in the U.S., we have continued to sell products within these brands but with a reduced level of marketing investment. 

Human Capital Resources 

Our success is the result of the engagement and commitment of our people, whom we refer to as tribe members. We believe that a tribe is a group of people who come together to feed and defend one another in order to fulfill a common purpose. Our purpose can only be achieved with the efforts of our 583 tribe members who create positive lasting memories for our stakeholders, including our end users as they work to ensure that our products solve problems in factories, workshops, and homes around the world. Our workforce is distributed globally in 15 countries, with approximately 34% in the Americas, 42% in EMEA, 15% in Asia-Pacific, and 9% corporate employees. Women make up approximately 46% of our global tribe. The average tenure of our global tribe is 8 years. 

A foundational strategic initiative is to attract, develop and engage outstanding tribe members. We believe that our ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain outstanding tribe members is the result of our inclusive, purpose-driven, learning focused and values guided culture. This strategic initiative guides our commitment to develop tribe members throughout the organization. One of the primary responsibilities of our leaders, whom we refer to as coaches, is to tailor individual development plans to support the needs of our tribe members to achieve their performance goals. We also offer various internal training programs to our tribe members and encourage attendance at external training programs that allow tribe members to grow from both a technical and leadership standpoint. As a result of the culture we have nurtured and evolved, we have increased employee engagement over time while expanding the size of our tribe to support our growing business. Our most recent biennial global employee engagement survey, which was conducted in January 2022 by an independent third-party, resulted in a very high employee engagement level of 93%. 

Consistently living our company values grants each of us the freedom and agility to make autonomous decisions yet remain aligned as we act in the best interest of all our stakeholders across the globe. Our approach to diversity and inclusion focuses on what unites us: a common purpose as a tribe. Our diverse global tribe, hired primarily within local markets, contains an array of talent and experiences, work collaboratively to solve problems and bring meaning to our work life. Our tribe is comprised of talented and dedicated members, many of whom work together with their international peers in the areas of: marketing, sales, customer service, finance and accounting, legal, information technology, human resources, supply chain and logistics, innovation, R&D, quality, and other technical fields. 

We believe our culture is a competitive advantage, and we prioritize it as such. Understanding the views, perspectives and experiences of our end-users and tribe members is foundational in maintaining and growing the WD-40 Company brand and business. Our language, norms, artifacts, and traditions result in psychological safety, learning, and goal achievement. This includes a total rewards strategy that ensures each tribe member can sustain their well-being today and into the future. 

The recent and ongoing global pandemic has reinforced the importance of our priority to maintain the safety, health, and well-being of every tribe member. During various stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of our workforce worked remotely, in accordance with public health and safety guidance. The pandemic inspired us to launch what we call “Work from Where”, a philosophy to support the work-life integration of our global tribe members. This “Work from Where” philosophy enables our coaches and tribe members to align on where work is completed. 

The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our relevant people-management practices. Our approach to compensation attempts to align the interests of every tribe member with the creation of company value over time. We completed a study in February 2020 to examine gender pay differences to determine if there were occasions of compensation decisions not being based on job-related criteria. This study identified no biased decision-making, as any differences were explainable by job-related criteria. The next study will be completed in calendar year 2023. We will continue to conduct equitable pay studies going forward and will include results from those studies in our future ESG reports. We invite you to review our ESG

Maintenance Products

Included in our maintenance products are both multi-purpose maintenance products and specialty maintenance products. These maintenance products are sold worldwide and they provide end users with a variety of product and delivery system options. 

Our signature product is WD-40 Multi-Use Product in the blue and yellow can with the little red top.

Sales and Marketing

Our sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality. However, it is common for our sales to fluctuate from period to period or year to year due to various factors including, but not limited to, new or lost distribution, the number of product offerings carried by a customer and the level of promotional activities and programs being run at customer locations. New or lost distribution occurs when we gain or lose customers, when we gain or lose store count for a customer or when our products are added to new locations within a store or removed from existing locations. From time to time, as part of new product offering launches, we may gain access to entirely new distribution channels. The number of product offerings refers to the number of brands and/or the number of products within each of those brands that our customers offer for sale to end user customers. The level of promotional activities and programs relates to the number of events or volumes of purchases by customers in support of off-shelf or promotional display activities. Changes in any one of these three factors or a combination of them can cause our sales levels to increase or decrease from period to period. It is also common and/or possible that we could lose distribution or product offerings and experience a decrease in promotional activities and programs in one period and subsequently regain this business in a future period. We are accustomed to such fluctuations and manage this as part of our normal business activities.
Manufacturing 

We outsource our finished goods manufacturing directly or through our marketing distributors to various third-party manufacturers. The Company or its marketing distributors use contract manufacturers in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, the U.K., Italy, Poland, Australia, China, South Korea and India. Although we have definitive minimum purchase obligations included in the contract terms with certain contract manufacturers, when such obligations have been included, they have either been immaterial or the minimum amounts have been such that they are below the volume of goods that we have historically purchased. Supply needs are communicated by us to our contract manufacturers, and we are committed to purchase the products manufactured based on orders and short-term projections, ranging from two months to six months, provided to the contract manufacturers. We also formulate and manufacture concentrate used in our WD-40 products at certain of our own facilities and at third-party contract manufacturers. 

In addition to the commitments to purchase products from contract manufacturers described above, we may also enter into commitments with other manufacturers from time to time to purchase finished goods and components to support innovation and renovation initiatives and/or supply chain initiatives. 

Sources and Availability of Components and Raw Materials 

We rely on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers and component suppliers, including single or sole-sourced suppliers, for certain of our raw materials, packaging, product components and other necessary supplies. Where possible and where it makes business sense, we work with secondary or multiple suppliers to qualify additional supply and, historically, we have been able to obtain adequate capacity and raw materials. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced certain constraints, particularly in our Americas supply chain. These challenges include general aerosol-related production capacity constraints primarily due to increased demand at third-party manufacturers along with shortages of certain other raw 


materials and freight services.  The primary components and raw materials for most of our products include specialty chemicals and aerosol cans, which are manufactured from commodities that are subject to market price fluctuations. The availability of these components and raw materials is affected by a variety of supply and demand factors, including global market conditions, plant capacity utilization, and natural disasters. We have been experiencing input cost inflation that has impacted the cost of certain raw materials and freight services over the last couple of years. Actions that we are taking to increase prices with our customers and cost savings initiatives that are currently underway will mitigate some of these inflationary pressures. Our business results depend on the effective management and remedy of any supply disruptions. We expect these components and raw materials to continue to be readily available in the future and we have developed sourcing alternatives and risk mitigation plans. We expect some level of market constraints to persist in fiscal year 2023, as described above.

Research and Development

We recognize the importance of innovation and renovation to our long-term success and are focused on and committed to research and new product development activities, primarily in our maintenance product group. Our product development team engages in consumer research, product development, current product improvement and testing activities. The product development team also leverages its development capabilities by partnering with a network of outside resources including our current and prospective outsource suppliers. In addition, the research and development team engages in activities and product development efforts which are necessary to ensure that we meet all regulatory requirements for the formulation of our products. Our research and development team currently conducts global testing at a laboratory facility that we lease in New Jersey.
Competition

The markets for our products, particularly those related to our homecare and cleaning products, are highly competitive. Our products compete both within their own product classes as well as within product distribution channels, competing with many other products for store placement and shelf space. Competition in international markets varies by country. We are aware of many competing products, some of which sell for lower prices or are produced and marketed by companies with greater financial resources than those of our Company. We rely on the awareness of our brands among consumers, the value offered by those brands as perceived by consumers, product innovation and renovation and our multiple channel distributions as our primary strategies. New products typically encounter intense competition, which may require advertising and promotional support and activities. When or if a new product achieves consumer acceptance, ongoing advertising and promotional support may be required in order to maintain its relative market position.
Trademarks and Patents

We own a number of patents, but rely primarily upon our established trademarks, brand names and marketing efforts, including advertising and sales promotions, to compete effectively. The WD-40 brand, 3-IN-ONE, Lava, Solvol, X-14, 2000 Flushes, Carpet Fresh and no vac, Spot Shot, GT85, and 1001 trademarks are registered or have pending registrations in various countries throughout the world.
