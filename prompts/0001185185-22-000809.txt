REGENERATIVE MEDICINE / CELL THERAPY INDUSTRY



Regenerative medicine is defined as the process of replacing or regenerating human cells, tissues or organs to restore normal function. Among the categories of therapeutic technology platforms within this field are cell therapy; tissue engineering; tools, devices and diagnostics; and aesthetic medicine. U.S. Stem Cell’s business model is focused on two of these areas. First, cell therapy, in which we introduce cells (adult, donor or patient, stem cell or differentiated) into the body to prevent and treat disease; and second, we are a provider of services and products to physicians and veterinaries who provide or seek to provide cellular therapies and direct patient care for individuals and animals who may benefit from cellular therapy.



All living complex organisms start as a single cell that replicates, differentiates (matures) and perpetuates in an adult organism through its lifetime. Cellular therapy is the process that uses cells to prevent, treat or cure disease, or regenerate damaged or aged tissue. To date, the most common type of cell therapy has been the replacement of mature, functioning cells such as through blood and platelet transfusions. Since the 1970s, first bone marrow and then blood and umbilical cord-derived stem cells have been used to restore bone marrow, as well as blood and immune system cells damaged by the chemotherapy and radiation that are used to treat many cancers. These types of cell therapies are standard practice world-wide and are typically reimbursed by insurance.



Within the field of cell therapy, research and development using stem cells to treat a host of diseases and conditions has greatly expanded. Stem cells (in either embryonic or adult forms) are primitive and undifferentiated cells that have the unique ability to transform into or otherwise affect many different cells, such as white blood cells, nerve cells or heart muscle cells. U.S. Stem Cell’s cell therapy development efforts are focused on the use of adult stem cells; those cells which are found in the muscle, fat tissue and peripheral blood.



There are two general classes of cell therapies: Patient Specific Cell Therapies (“PSCTs”) and Off-the-Shelf Cell Therapies (“OSCTs”). In PSCTs, cells collected from a person (“donor”) are transplanted, with or without modification, to a patient (“recipient”). In cases where the donor and the recipient are the same individual, these procedures are referred to as “autologous”. In cases in which the donor and the recipient are not the same individual, these procedures are referred to as “allogeneic.” Autologous cells offer a low likelihood of rejection by the patient and we believe the long-term benefits of these PSCTs can best be achieved with an autologous product. In the case of OSCT, donor cells are expanded many fold in tissue culture, and large banks of cells are frozen in individual aliquots that may result in treatments, in our observation, for as many as 10,000 people from a single donor tissue. By definition, OSCTs are always allogeneic in nature.



CELLULAR THERAPY PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE



Specific to cellular therapy, we are focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of autologous cellular therapies for the treatment of chronic and acute heart damage as well as vascular and autoimmune diseases.



In our pipeline, subject to development based on future financing, and regulatory approval we have multiple product candidates for the treatment of heart damage, including MyoCell™ and Myocell SDF-1. MyoCell and MyoCell SDF-1 are autologous muscle-derived cellular therapies designed to populate regions of scar tissue within a patient’s heart with new living cells for the purpose of improving cardiac function in chronic heart failure patients.



MyoCell SDF-1 is intended to be an improvement to MyoCell™. MyoCell SDF-1 is similar to MyoCell but the myoblast cells to be injected for use in MyoCell SDF-1 are modified prior to injection by an adenovirus vector or non-viral vector so that they will release extra quantities of the SDF-1 protein, which expresses angiogenic factors.



At present, our development pipeline is on hold and no assurances can be provided as to when they will restart.

STATUS OF CELLULAR THERAPY PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CLINICAL TRIALS.



MyoCell/MyoCell SDF-1



MyoCell™ is a regenerative, cellular therapy intended to improve cardiac function for those with congestive heart failure and is designed to be utilized months or even years after a patient has suffered severe heart damage due to a heart attack or other cause. We believe that MyoCell has the potential to become a leading treatment for severe, chronic damage to the heart due to its perceived ability to satisfy, at least in part, what we believe to be an unmet demand for more effective and/or more affordable therapies for chronic heart damage. MyoCell™ uses myoblasts, cells that are precursors to muscle cells, from the patient’s own body. The myoblasts are removed from a patient’s thigh muscle, isolated, grown through our proprietary cell culturing process, and injected directly in the scar tissue of a patient’s heart. A qualified physician performs this minimally invasive procedure using an endoventricular catheter. We entered into an agreement with Biosense Webster (a Johnson & Johnson company) to use its NOGA® Cardiac Navigation System along with its MyoStar™ injection catheter for the delivery of MyoCell™ in the MARVEL Trial (as defined below).



When injected into scar tissue within the heart wall, myoblasts have been shown to be capable of engrafting in the damaged tissue and differentiating into mature skeletal muscle cells. In a number of clinical and animal studies, the engrafted skeletal muscle cells have been shown to express various proteins that are important components of contractile function. By using myoblasts obtained from a patient’s own body, we believe MyoCell™ is able to avoid certain challenges currently faced by other types of cell-based clinical therapies including tissue rejection and instances of the cells differentiating into cells other than muscle. Although a number of therapies have proven to improve the cardiac function of a damaged heart, no currently available competing treatment, to our knowledge, has demonstrated an ability to generate new muscle tissue within the scarred regions of a heart as MyoCell™ has demonstrated.



Our completed clinical trials of MyoCell™ were primarily targeted to patients with severe, chronic damage to the heart, who are in Class II or Class III heart failure according to the New York Heart Association, or NYHA, heart failure classification system. The NYHA system classifies patients in one of four categories based on how limited they are during physical activity. NYHA Class II heart failure patients have a mild limitation of activity and are generally comfortable at rest or with mild exertion while NYHA Class III heart failure patients suffer from a marked limitation of activity and are generally comfortable only at rest.



We believe the market for treating patients in NYHA Class II or NYHA Class III heart failure is significant. According to the American Heart Association (“AHA”) Statistics and the European Society of Cardiology Task Force for the Treatment of Chronic Heart Failure, in the United States and Europe there are approximately 5.2 million and 9.6 million, respectively, patients with heart failure. The AHA Statistics further indicate that, after heart failure is diagnosed, the one-year mortality rate is high, with one in five dying and that 80% of men and 70% of women under age 65 who have heart failure will die within eight years.



We believe that approximately 60% of heart failure patients are in either NYHA Class II or NYHA Class III heart failure based upon a 1999 study entitled “Congestive Heart Failure Due to Diastolic or Systolic Dysfunction – Frequency and Patient Characteristics in an Ambulatory Setting” by Diller, PM, et. al.



MyoCell™ SDF-1 is intended to be an improvement to MyoCell™. MyoCell™ SDF-1 is similar to MyoCell™ except that the myoblast cells to be injected for use in MyoCell™ SDF-1 will be modified prior to injection by an adenovirus vector or non-viral vector so that they will release extra quantities of the SDF-1 protein, which expresses angiogenic factors. Adipocell is a patient-derived cell therapy proposed for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, chronic heart ischemia, and lower limb ischemia. We hope to demonstrate that these product candidates are safe and effective complements to existing therapies for chronic and acute heart damage.



We have completed various clinical trials for MyoCell™ including the SEISMIC Trial, a 40-patient, randomized, multicenter, controlled, Phase II-a study conducted in Europe and the MYOHEART Trial, a 20-patient, multicenter, Phase I dose-escalation trial conducted in the United States. We were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the “FDA”, to proceed with a 330-patient, multicenter Phase II/III trial of MyoCell™ in North America and Europe, or the “MARVEL Trial”. We completed the MyoCell™ implantation procedure on the first patient in the MARVEL Trial on October 24, 2007. Thus far, 20 patients, including 6 control patients, have been treated. Initial results for the 20 patients were released at the Heart Failure Society of American meeting in September, 2009, showing a significant (35%) improvement in the 6 minute walk for those patients who were treated, and no improvement for those who received a placebo. On the basis of these results, we have applied for and received approval from the FDA to reduce the number of additional patients in the trial to 134, for a total of 154 patients. We are planning, on the basis of these results, to request the FDA to consider the MARVEL Trial a pivotal trial (pivotal from Phase II to Phase III) and to reduce the number of patients in the trial to 150. No assurances can be provided that this request will be approved. We have also initiated the MIRROR trial, which is a Phase III, double-blind placebo controlled study for centers outside the United States. The SEISMIC, MYOHEART, MARVEL and MIRROR Trials have been designed to test the safety and efficacy of MyoCell™ in treating patients with severe, chronic damage to the heart. We received approval from the FDA in July of 2009 to conduct a Phase I safety study on 15 patients of a combined therapy (MyoCell™ with SDF-1) called the REGEN trial, during the first quarter of 2010.

Business Strategy



U.S. Stem Cell’s mission is to advance to market novel regenerative medicine and cellular therapy products that substantially benefit humankind. Our business strategy is, to the extent possible, finance our clinical development pipeline through revenue (cash in-flows) generated through the marketing and sales of unique educational and training services, animal health products and distribution of products in the industry.



A fundamental shift in venture capital investment strategies where, management believes, financial sponsorship is now directed toward commercial or near commercial enterprises has required U.S. Stem Cell to adapt its mission combining immediate revenue generating opportunities with longer-term development programs. Accordingly, U.S. Stem Cell developed a multifaceted portfolio of revenue generating products and services in its US Stem Cell Training and Vetbiologics, operating divisions that will, if successful, financially support its clinical development programs. Our goal is to maximize shareholder value through the generation of short-term profits that increase cash in-flows and decrease the need venture financings – a modern biotechnology company development strategy. On May 9, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an injunctive action, specifically United States of America v. U.S. Stem Clinic, LLC, U.S. Stem Cell, Inc., Kristin C. Comella, and Theodore Gradel. The Complaint was filed at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and alleges that the respective defendants manufacture “stromal vascular fraction” (SVF) products from patient adipose (fat) tissue, which the companies then market as stem cell-based treatments without first obtaining what the government alleges are necessary FDA approvals. The Company retained counsel to defend in this action. On June 25, 2019, the federal court for the Southern District of Florida ruled in favor of the government, enjoining the Company and the other defendants from certain product sales and processes. The Company filed an appeal on August 23, 2019 and attended oral argument on January 13th, 2021. On June 2nd, 2021, the Eleventh Circuit Court ruled to affirm lower courts’ judgement. The Company did not challenge the district court’s judgment upon any other ground. The Company is not able to predict the duration, scope, results, or consequences of the U.S. Department of Justice actions and final rulings and management is assessing its options on a going forward basis.



We will continue to evaluate and act upon opportunities to increase our top line revenue position and that correspondingly increase cash in-flows. These opportunities include but are not limited to the development and marketing of new products and services, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing deals and more.



Further, if the opportunity presents itself whereby the Company can raise additional capital at a reasonable fair market value, the Company will do so. Accordingly, we plan to continue in our efforts to restructure, equitize or eliminate legacy balance sheet issues that are obstacles to market capitalization appreciation and capital fund raising.

GENERAL AMERICAN CAPITAL PARTNERS



On March 3, 2017, we entered into an asset sale and lease agreement (sale/leaseback transaction; “Asset Sale and Lease Agreement”), with GACP (General American Capital Partners) Stem Cell Bank LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“GACP) whereby we sold certain lab, medical and other equipment relating to the cell banking business for $400,000 and leased back the sold equipment over a three year term. The lease includes a base monthly rental payment of $20,000, due the first day of each calendar month. In addition, we are required to pay 2.3%, 22.5% and 31.6% of revenues collected on deposits arising from cell banking business for years 1, 2 and 3, respectively. At the expiration of the lease, we returned all leased equipment and along with any maintenance records, logs, etc. in our possession to the lessor with no right of repurchase. Further, as a consequence of the Court Order , the Company resolved to divest itself of certain equipment and other assets (the “Equipment Assets”) used in connection with the Company’s human tissue banking business, but consistent however with the requirements of the Court Order, and to adjust the business plan and operations to accommodate this potential divesture. The divestiture became effective October 10th, 2019.
Royalty Agreement/Middle East



On November 9, 2016, the Company entered into an Intellectual Property License Agreement whereby the Company granted High Rise Group Company the exclusive right to the Company’s intellectual property (as defined) for the licensed use and development in Kuwait and other GCC/Middle East countries for 25 years in exchange for a payment of $75,000 and a 5% royalty generated under the agreement. The royalty payment is recorded as deferred revenue and amortized over the term of the agreement. The carrying balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $59,500 and $62,500 respectively.



The intent is for U.S. Stem Cell Middle East to offer regenerative treatment options to patients, based on U.S. Stem Cell, Inc. products and technologies like MyoCell™. To date, the first clinic in Kuwait City has been completed but has not begun operations as High Rising Group has not yet been able to secure regulatory approvals to operate. No assurances can be provided as to the ability to secure regulatory approvals to operate or the capacity for any significant revenues arising from such operation once commenced.



U.S. STEM CELL, INC.



U.S. Stem Cell markets several products to physicians for in clinic regenerative medicine use. These products include equipment (centrifuges, heating block, laminar hood, autoclave) necessary to separate and obtain cellular medicine therapies. We are also providing a variety of materials necessary to obtain fat and/or bone marrow including cannulas, trocars, syringes and other supplies. U.S. Stem Cell also supplies laboratory kits for processing adipose and bone marrow tissue to obtain a mixture of cells for use in clinic. These kits include disposables and reagents. U.S. Stem Cell also provides banking services to patients interested in storing their fat or bone marrow and the cells from this tissue. U.S. Stem Cell is a registered FDA tissue bank in good standing.
Patents and Proprietary Rights



We own or hold licenses or sublicenses to an intellectual property portfolio consisting of numerous patents and patent applications in the United States, and in foreign countries, for use in the field of heart muscle regeneration. References in this report to “our” patents and patent applications and other similar references include the patents and patent applications that are owned by us, and references to patents and patent applications that are “licensed” to us and other similar references refer to patents, patent applications and other intellectual property that are licensed or sublicensed to us.



Patent life determination depends on the date of filing of the application or the date of patent issuance and other factors as promulgated under the patent laws. Under the U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, as amended, a patent which claims a product, use or method of manufacture covering drugs and certain other products, including biologic products, may be extended for up to five years to compensate the patent holder for a portion of the time required for research and FDA review of the product. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug or biologic product is eligible for a patent term extension. This law also establishes a period of time following approval of a drug or biologic product during which the FDA may not accept or approve applications for certain similar or identical drugs or biologic products from other sponsors unless those sponsors provide their own safety and efficacy data.

MyoCell™ is no longer protected by patents, which means that competitors will be free to sell products that incorporate the same or similar technologies that are used in MyoCell™ without infringing our patent rights. As a result, MyoCell, if approved for use, may be vulnerable to competition. In addition, many of the patent and patent applications that have been licensed to us that pertain to our other product candidates do not cover certain countries within Europe.



Our commercial success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to:




● | defend and enforce our patents and/or compel the owners of the patents licensed to us to defend and enforce such patents, to the extent such patents may be applicable to our products and material to their commercialization;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | obtain additional patent and other proprietary protection for MyoCell™ and our other product candidates; 
● | obtain and/or maintain appropriate licenses to patents, patent applications or other proprietary rights held by others with respect to our technology, both in the United States and other countries; and 
● | preserve company trade secrets and other intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates; and operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. 




In addition to patented intellectual property, we also rely on our own trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our technology and maintain our competitive position, since patent protection may not be available or applicable to our technology. Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality and inventions assignment agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. The agreements generally provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements generally also provide that we shall own all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us. Moreover, some of our academic institution licensors, collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data and information to which we have rights, which may impair our ability to protect our proprietary information or obtain patent protection in the future.



We work with others in our research and development activities and one of our strategies is to enter into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop our proposed products. Disputes may arise about inventorship and corresponding rights in know-how and inventions resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our licensors, collaborators, consultants and others. In addition, other parties may circumvent any proprietary protection we do have. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our proprietary position.



We are not currently a party to any litigation or other adverse proceeding challenging our patents, patent licenses or intellectual property rights. However, if we become involved in litigation or any other adverse intellectual property proceeding, for example, as a result of an alleged infringement, or a third party alleging an earlier date of invention, we may have to spend significant amounts of money and time and, in the event of an adverse ruling, we could be subject to liability for damages, including treble damages, invalidation of our intellectual property and injunctive relief that could prevent us from using technologies or developing products, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.



In addition, any claims relating to the infringement of third party proprietary rights, or earlier date of invention, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, lengthy governmental proceedings, divert management’s attention and resources and require us to enter royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous, if available at all.



See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for a discussion of additional risks we face with respect to our intellectual property rights.



Recent Developments



COVID-19



In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was reported in Wuhan, China.
