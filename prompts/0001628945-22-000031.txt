BUSINESS
Overview
We are a health technology company, and our mission is to enable personalized, proactive and informed healthcare that empowers people to live their healthiest lives. Digital transformation has revolutionized nearly every industry except healthcare to create new, consumer-first experiences that are both personalized and empowering. We seek to usher in a new era in healthcare, what we call Healthcare 2.0, to transform how acute and chronic conditions are diagnosed and managed. 
We are helping pioneer this healthcare digital transformation, beginning with diagnostics. We started from consumer-centric principles and designed our proprietary platform, the Cue Integrated Care Platform, with a relentless focus on user experience, convenience, and accuracy. The Cue Integrated Care Platform consists of hardware and software components: (1) our revolutionary Cue Health Monitoring System, made up of a portable, durable and reusable reader, or Cue Reader, a single-use test cartridge, or Cue Cartridge, and a sample collection wand, or Cue Wand, (2) our Cue Data and Innovation Layer, with cloud-based data and analytics capability, (3) our Cue Virtual Care Delivery Apps, including our consumer-friendly Cue Health App and our Cue Enterprise Dashboard, and (4) our Cue Ecosystem Integrations and Apps, which allow for integrations with third-party applications and sensors.
Our platform has been designed to work seamlessly to deliver and manage health data both within the healthcare system and within the home. Through our application programming interfaces, or APIs, our platform has been engineered so that it can be directly integrated into existing workflows and on-demand services, such as telemedicine, e-prescription services, and electronic medical record, or EMR, systems. For example, we implemented an integration with one of the U.S.’s leading EMR systems on behalf of one of our customers, a leading healthcare system, to enable a seamless workflow from test ordering to test result, with our mobile app and the Cue Health Monitoring System. But beyond designing our platform to be able to integrate within the traditional healthcare system, we have built our platform to enable fast, frequent, lab-quality diagnostics by anyone, anywhere, intended to facilitate a new continuous care model of personalized and contextualized healthcare. Our first commercially available diagnostic test for use with our Cue Health Monitoring System, our Cue COVID-19 Test Kit, which has been authorized by two Emergency Use Authorizations, or EUAs, from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, or the FDA, for point-of-care and over-the-counter and at-home use, an Interim Order authorization from Health Canada, and authorization in Singapore from the Health Sciences Authority, are examples of this. Users can run a COVID-19 test anywhere using the Cue Reader and a Cue COVID-19 Test Kit, and have lab-quality test results delivered digitally to the user’s mobile device in about 20 minutes. While our Cue COVID-19 Test Kit is our only commercially available Test Kit and our future tests remain subject to technical development, clinical studies and regulatory authorization, clearance or approval, we have five additional Test Kits that we consider to be in late-stage technical development (influenza A/B, or flu, respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, fertility, pregnancy, and inflammation) for which we expect to begin submitting for FDA authorization or clearance in the second half of 2022. Based on the working prototypes we have developed for our Test Kits in late-stage technical development, as well as other Test Kits we currently have in development, and the clinical and other development work we have performed to date with respect to our Test Kits in development, we expect that all of our Test Kits currently in development will work within our Cue Health Monitoring System in a manner similar to our Cue COVID-19 Test Kit and will be able to be utilized with our Cue Health App and the Cue Enterprise Dashboard and be capable of being integrated with existing workflows, including EMRs, and with other planned on-demand services. We believe our model, driven by our platform, will empower our users to actively manage their health, which we believe will result in improved health outcomes and a more resilient, connected, and efficient healthcare ecosystem for all. We further believe that our platform positions us to be at the center of the broader healthcare ecosystem as it continues to undergo a massive virtual and digital shift. Through our connected diagnostic solution, we seek to enable the shift of care to virtual settings, while also connecting the physical care paradigm to the new digital ecosystem. 
While our Cue COVID-19 Test Kit is our first, and currently only, commercially available test, our vision was always to build a broad platform that would reinvent how we interact with our health. Since our early days, we developed our platform to be able to address the majority of diagnostic tests routinely conducted in clinical laboratories because we believe that users will not only demand a simple, personalized, convenient and connected solution but also a single platform to address their healthcare needs. Our focus is on creating experiences with the user at the center, enabling high satisfaction, measurable health outcomes, and more cost-effective care for the entire ecosystem.
In October 2020, we entered into a $480.9 million agreement, or the U.S. DoD Agreement, with the U.S. Department of Defense, or U.S. DoD, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or U.S. HHS, to scale up our production and deliver 6,000,000 Cue COVID-19 Test Kits and 30,000 Cue Readers. Today our platform is relied upon every day for vital 
Table of Contents

COVID-19 testing across schools, enterprises, nursing homes, hospitals, physicians’ offices, dental clinics, sports and other live event venues, federal and state agencies, and other settings around the country as well as by individual end-users testing in their homes. 
Prior to March 31, 2021, we were required, pursuant to the U.S. DoD agreement, to deliver to the U.S. government all of our manufacturing output of our Cue COVID-19 Test Kits, subject to limited exceptions. The U.S. DoD agreement initially contemplated a ramp-up in our production to 100,000 Cue COVID-19 Test Kits per day for a seven-day period and final delivery of the required Cue Readers and Cue COVID-19 Test Kits by March 31, 2021. However, in March 2021, the production ramp up target and final product delivery dates were extended by mutual agreement to October 2021, and in September 2021, that date was extended to December 31, 2021. In April 2021, the U.S. DoD granted us a waiver whereby, effective May 1, 2021, we are permitted to sell up to 50% of our manufacturing output of our Cue COVID-19 Test Kits to additional customers. Notwithstanding the waiver granted to us by the U.S. DoD, we were still required under the U.S. DoD agreement to deliver 30,000 Cue Readers, 6,000,000 COVID-19 Test Kits and 60,000 COVID-19 Control Swab Packs by December 31, 2021. We have fulfilled the requirement to ramp up our production capacity to approximately 100,000 COVID-19 Test Kits per day for a seven-day period by December 31, 2021. Since we received the waiver from the U.S. DoD and our second FDA EUA for over-the-counter and at-home testing for our Cue COVID-19 Test Kit, we have been able to add several new enterprise customers and extend our business with existing customers. For example, we have added certain major technology and other enterprises as customers who are providing our solution to their employees for use in their homes as part of return to work initiatives and ongoing employee health benefits. In addition, for the 2021 and 2022 NBA basketball seasons, we have been able to extend our relationship with the NBA to provide our testing solution for use by players, their families, staff and referees, at home and on the road. 
We believe our platform will allow us to develop and commercialize new tests quickly and scale rapidly, driven by our flexible technology and our in-house, vertically-integrated and automated manufacturing facilities. Our platform has the potential to perform a variety of different tests by accommodating different sample types, including saliva, blood, urine and swabs, and detecting nucleic acids, small molecules, proteins or cells. Because we developed our manufacturing facilities and processes in tandem with our technology, we were able to scale our production to produce a rate of millions of Test Kits per year using fully automated production pods. A production pod is a free standing, modular environmentally-controlled structure containing an automated test cartridge production line. Additionally, we produce our critical biochemistry in-house, including enzymes, antibodies and primers for our Cue Cartridges. Our current manufacturing capacity is at a rate of over 20 million Cue Cartridges per year.
We first began generating revenue from product sales in August 2020 following the receipt of our first EUA from the FDA for our COVID-19 test in June 2020. We generated $618.1 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, of which approximately $615.8 million was from product sales. Of this amount, $383.0 million of total revenue was from public sector entities, substantially all of which was from the U.S. DoD, and the remaining $232.8 million of total revenue was generated from other customers. In 2020, we generated $23.0 million of total revenue, of which $8.9 million was from public sector entities. The U.S. DoD and Henry Schein accounted for approximately 53.1% of our total revenue in 2020. In 2019, we generated $6.6 million of total revenue, none of which was from product sales. With the conclusion of the initial U.S. DoD contract in December 2021, we anticipate that the related increased end-market flexibility along with improved sales and distribution capabilities will increase the percentage of our revenue derived from non-public sector customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our net income was $86.4 million. In 2020, we incurred a net loss of $47.4 million.
Our Solution 
Our Cue Integrated Care Platform is simple, fast, and accurate. Our Platform is designed to harness the power of the cloud and provide consumers and enterprises with real-time access to their data and the broader healthcare ecosystem as part of our planned end-to-end solution. Development of the Cue Integrated Care Platform is guided by our focus on the user, whether that be a clinician in a provider office or an individual at home, with a simple goal of enabling users to have reliable information at their fingertips to make faster and more informed healthcare decisions. The Cue Integrated Care Platform consists of the following hardware and software components. 
Cue Health Monitoring System
The Cue Health Monitoring System consists of our Cue Reader and Cue Test Kit. The Cue Reader is an elegantly designed, automated analyzer of test results and is used with Cue Test Kits and the Cue Health App. The Cue Reader contains all the circuitry necessary to process, analyze, and communicate test results digitally, including encrypted Bluetooth radio communication and other sensors. The Cue Reader runs the Cue Cartridge and communicates the result of the test digitally via Bluetooth to the Cue Health App. The Cue Reader is easy to set-up and use and is designed to be universally compatible with our current and planned future Cue Cartridges. Each Cue Test Kit is comprised of a Cue Cartridge and a Cue Wand. The Cue Cartridge is a sample-specific, single-use cartridge designed to handle different chemistries. Each Cue Cartridge contains the 
Table of Contents

specific reagents and associated materials required to detect the target of the particular test and is designed with ease-of-use, user safety, and scalability in mind. The Cue Wand is a single-use and sterile sample collection device designed to permit collection of multiple sample types, including saliva, blood, urine, and swab, with only minor modification. When a Cue Wand is inserted into the associated Cue Cartridge the system automatically runs the test and delivers the result to our Cue Health App.
Cue Data and Innovation Layer
Our cloud-native Cue Data and Innovation Layer stores and curates the data from our Cue Health Monitoring System and provides a secure environment for users to access current and historical health data. Our Data and Innovation Layer has the ability to collate unstructured and structured data from a wide variety of data sources, which we believe will give us the ability in the future to store and analyze more holistic sets of health data, including from other testing modalities and wearables. The Cue Data and Innovation Layer provides the foundation for our Cue Virtual Care Delivery Apps and has enabled the development of our Cue Ecosystem Integrations and Apps. The Cue Data and Innovation Layer currently contains an API that allows for the data from tests performed on the Cue Health Monitoring System to be received, stored, and retrieved by the end user. For enterprises deploying the Cue Enterprise Dashboard, the Cue Data and Innovation Layer enables the creation of a network of users affiliated by roles with the enterprise. Within this network of users, the Cue Data and Innovation Layer provides the engine behind test analytics, creation of groups, scheduling and compliance, reporting, and enterprise-specific privacy policy management. The Cue Data and Innovation Layer powers the EMR integration with major EMR providers.
Cue Virtual Care Delivery Apps
Our Cue Virtual Care Delivery Apps consist of the Cue Health App and the Cue Enterprise Dashboard. To run a Test Kit on the Cue Reader, a user will need to download and utilize the Cue Health App. This mobile app creates a secure interface between the user and their health data. For consumers, it allows a single point of entry for their health data; for healthcare professionals, it is designed to provide a unified platform for managing patient histories and, in the future, is expected to allow for telemedicine and e-prescription services. The Cue Enterprise Dashboard is designed to allow enterprises, payors, healthcare providers and public health entities to manage population health at the organizational level and has the potential to track the efficiency of various population health programs. Accessible online, the Cue Enterprise Dashboard has the potential to help organizations manage a patient’s journey from onboarding to scheduling, care management and inventory management. Powered by our analytics engine and role-based access capabilities, it is designed to provide chief medical officers, environmental health and safety officials, and benefits managers with insight into their organization’s population health, helping to facilitate decision making.
Cue Ecosystem Integrations and Apps
By securely connecting our Cue Data and Innovation Layer with on-demand services, such as telemedicine and e-prescription services, and integrating with wearable technology, we believe we will enable a truly digital and seamless user experience. In the future, we plan on enhancing our platform to enable third-party application development and offerings that complement our solutions. In addition, our ability to integrate with anchor EMR systems, such as Epic Systems Corporation, or Epic, allows our customers to integrate our platform with their existing systems, creating an agile and responsive workflow for patient monitoring for ongoing care, better intelligence and reporting, and more efficient provider-level health management.
Our Underlying Diagnostic Technology 
Once a test sample is collected via the Cue Wand and inserted into the Cue Cartridge, the test automatically begins. Depending on the type of Cue Cartridge, our platform uses either a nucleic acid amplification tests (“NAAT”) or immunoassay to perform a test. In both cases, an internal or process control confirms proper assay execution including, as relevant, sample analysis, amplification, sample flow and assay reagent function. Once the assay begins, all heating, mixing, amplification and detection takes place within the Cue Cartridge with no steps by the user. The Cue Reader then communicates the test result digitally, directly and wirelessly to the Cue Virtual Care Delivery Apps. 
Our Testing Technologies 
Molecular Tests
Molecular tests, also known as NAAT, target genetic material (DNA or RNA) in order to detect a broad range of infectious diseases, and are considered to be the most reliable for this purpose. PCR and isothermal amplification are two types of molecular testing techniques. The Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, has described molecular tests as the “gold standard” for clinical diagnostic detection of COVID-19. Our COVID-19 Test was the first molecular diagnostic test authorized for at-home and over-the-counter use without physician supervision or a prescription. For infectious diseases, molecular tests are more sensitive than antigen tests and have been recommended by the CDC as the preferred testing technology.

Immunoassay Tests
Immunoassays are widely used in clinical care. In clinical laboratories, the most common immunoassay technique is the is the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay, or ELISA, which is a fundamental clinical diagnostic methodology for detecting and quantifying a wide range of analytes and is one of the main modern lab techniques employed by central labs for a variety of clinical applications. Our ability to perform ELISA-like chemistry within the same cartridge structure we use to run our molecular tests enables us to detect and quantify the biomarkers necessary to expand our care offerings for use cases, including in cardiometabolic health (cholesterol, inflammation, HbA1c), men’s health (testosterone, prostate specific antigen), women’s health (pregnancy, fertility), other cardiac care (troponin, brain natriuretic peptide), wellness (vitamin D), and other tests. 
Our Key Differentiators
We believe the following attributes differentiate us from other diagnostic solutions and digital health companies:
•Consumer-centric. The Cue Integrated Care Platform is intended to revolutionize the way individuals and healthcare providers access diagnostic testing at home, at work, or at the point-of-care. Our Cue Integrated Care Platform is designed to deliver a superior user experience in any setting, one that is fully-guided, fast, accurate, and easy to use and that puts the consumer in control of their health data. Users only have to take the test and the Platform does the rest, obviating the need for many in-person testing visits and sample shipments, with a focus on at-home testing which we believe is the most consumer-centric and convenient setting. Results are presented in an easy-to-understand format through our Cue Health App and Cue Enterprise Dashboard. The digital nature of our results allows consumers to access their medical data immediately. By connecting this data to the wider healthcare ecosystem, consumers will be able to securely share their data with key stakeholders in their care journey and further streamlining the user experience. This will allow for more testing to be performed at the right point in the care journey, enabling diagnostics to drive care decisions.
•Lab-quality diagnostics anywhere in minutes. By combining the sophistication and accuracy of complex molecular testing platforms with the simplicity, convenience and speed of a consumer electronic device, our Cue Health Monitoring System has been developed to deliver highly specific and sensitive results within minutes. As a result, we believe our tests will provide a better, more convenient user experience compared to traditional lab tests while also delivering “gold standard” molecular testing results - all from a device that fits in the palm of your hand. The accuracy of the Cue Health Monitoring System was confirmed by a recent independent study, conducted by researchers at the Mayo Clinic, that found that the overall concordance between our COVID-19 test and clinical laboratory tests using NAAT was 97.8%.
•Extensible platform approach. We designed our technology, platform and infrastructure to be versatile in accommodating a wide range of tests by addressing both main analytical modalities used in diagnostic testing, immunoassays and NAAT. We believe our flexible platform will permit our planned future menu of tests to cover a large portion of diagnostic solutions typically offered by a traditional lab. The extensibility of our platform is due to the reusability of the Cue Reader, the uniform design of single-use Cue Cartridges and the synergies in chemistry across our pipeline of contemplated future tests, which we believe will allow us to quickly expand and upsell our menu in a cost-efficient manner. We have demonstrated our ability to quickly develop tests, having developed our highly accurate COVID-19 test within weeks. Our natively digital results enable seamless integration into our apps and cloud-based software platform as well as allow for integration with the broader healthcare and partner ecosystem.
•Vertically-integrated, automated and scalable production infrastructure. Our proprietary technology was designed to enable us to optimize our system across the full product life cycle from design to manufacturing. Our integrated cartridge manufacturing and bio-production, including enzymes and chemistry, ensure the quality of our finished product. Our vertically-integrated and highly automated manufacturing facilities, which we developed alongside our science and technology and where we manufacture our Cue Cartridges, result in what we believe is a highly cost efficient and rapidly scalable manufacturing process. We further designed our manufacturing production pods to scale rapidly and allow for the production of any type of test cartridge in our planned future menu. We believe this will allow us to dramatically shorten our time to market when compared to traditional diagnostic manufacturing and to adapt to new market demands quickly and efficiently.
•Scaled and growing installed base. We have shipped over 160,000 Cue Readers across the United States as of December 31, 2021, including Cue Readers placed through our U.S. DoD Agreement and through our other customer agreements, resulting in a broad installed base, diversified across industries, locations and end-markets such as schools, essential businesses, nursing homes, hospitals, physicians' offices, dental clinics, sports and other live events, and other settings around the country. With our EUA for at-home and over-the-counter COVID-19 testing, we expect to significantly grow our install base over the coming months and gain a place in more consumer households across the U.S. and internationally. Given our Cue Readers are reusable and universally compatible with our current and 
Table of Contents

planned future Cue Cartridges, we believe this installed base and population of active users will position us well as we expand our testing menu. In addition, our installed base provides us with a wealth of data generation for our own use, and which we intend to use to improve our current and future product offerings.
Strategic Collaborations and Certain Other Agreements
U.S. Government
•BARDA - We have partnered with the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, since June 2018, initially focusing on a molecular influenza test using the Cue Health Monitoring System pursuant to a contract that was originally effective through January 2021 and that provided $14.0 million in base funding. In March 2020, BARDA exercised an option to accelerate development, validation and FDA clearance of our COVID-19 test for a $13.7 million award. This funding enabled us to accelerate the development and validation of our COVID-19 test. In May 2020, our original contract with BARDA was amended to increase the base value from $14.0 million to $21.8 million and to extend the contract term to January 2023. Pursuant to our agreement with BARDA, we agreed to provide regular reports to BARDA regarding our progress and certain customary oversight provisions. BARDA can terminate this agreement for convenience or if we fail to meet our obligations, subject to our opportunity to cure such defaults. Furthermore, in January 2022, the scope of our partnership with BARDA was increased to include our development of an Omicron-Genotyping COVID-19 test to be used in professional point-of-care settings.
•Department of Defense/Department of Health and Human Services
◦In October 2020, we entered into an agreement, as amended in March 2021 and September 2021, for an aggregate of $480.9 million, with the U.S. DoD to expand our U.S.-based production capacity, to deploy 6,000,000 Cue COVID-19 Test Kits, 30,000 Cue Readers and 60,000 Cue Control Swab Packs (which is comprised of three positive and three negative control swabs per pack) pursuant to the delivery schedule under the agreement and demonstrate our ability to manufacture an average of approximately 100,000 Cue COVID-19 Cartridges per day over a consecutive seven-day period by December 31, 2021. Included as part of the $480.9 million contract amount was an upfront payment of $184.6 million to scale our manufacturing. This payment was intended to help us onshore our supply chain and rapidly increase our production capacity to enable and support domestic production of critical medical resources. In December 2021, we completed the shipment of all required Cue Readers, Control Swab Packs and COVID-19 Test Kits under the agreement.
◦In November 2020, as part of our agreement with the U.S. DoD, we started deployment of a pilot program in coordination with the U.S. HHS to assess how to best integrate our diagnostic technology into public health strategies for disease surveillance and infection control in institutions, such as nursing homes. Through this program, our COVID-19 test is currently being used in the U.S. in point-of-care settings with high-concern populations and congregate care settings, such as nursing homes, long-term care, assisted living facilities, veterans’ homes, K-12 schools, correctional facilities, homeless populations, essential businesses, remote and tribal communities, and hospitals. In the pilot program, the U.S. HHS is using our COVID-19 test to verify the results of antigen tests, which are less sensitive than molecular and PCR tests and occasionally prone to false positives. This pilot program was expanded to ten states in January 2021. As part of this pilot program, we have the ability to directly work with the state or local authorities that decide how to distribute our COVID-19 tests in their jurisdictions, including the ability to offer support and to sell our COVID-19 test directly to such state and local authorities. As of December 31, 2021, we have delivered 6 million of our COVID-19 tests under the pilot program.
◦During the term of our agreement with the U.S. DoD, we agreed that the U.S. government would be the exclusive purchaser of our entire production until our development obligations under this agreement have been completed, except for previously existing contracts and subject to agreed upon waivers. In April 2021, we received the U.S. DoD Waiver, effective May 1, 2021, which allowed us to distribute commercially up to 50% of our COVID-19 Test production, measured monthly in arrears on a calendar month basis, to non-U.S. federal government customers and other recipients. We also agreed to provide regular reports as to the status of our production and distribution.
◦Under the agreement, following completion of our agreement, we have agreed to negotiate in good faith with the U.S. DoD for a new production agreement under which the U.S. DoD would have the right to purchase up to 45% of our quarterly production at a discount to the lowest price offered by us to a commercial customer for the same products, equivalent quantities and comparable terms of sale, subject to a price floor.

The collaboration agreement has a three-year term, unless it is earlier terminated in accordance with its terms.
NBA
In July 2020, we entered into a services agreement with the NBA to provide the Cue Health Monitoring System and our Cue COVID-19 Test Kits to the NBA to support testing within the “Bubble” established by the NBA at Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida in order to complete the 2019–2020 NBA season, as well as community-facing testing that the NBA was engaging in as part of its operations in Orlando. We worked with the NBA to design the testing workflow, such that our test could be administered with speed, scale, and efficiency, adhering to the NBA’s health and safety protocols. Our Cue COVID-19 test was used in an assessment at high exposure points to test vendors who needed frequent access, further securing this Bubble, as part of the NBA’s overall strategy, and contributing to safe, uninterrupted operations. 
Under the services agreement, we agreed to supply the NBA with, among other things, tests each week through November 1, 2020, subject to preferences for essential healthcare workers, governmental entities, and certain non-profits. In November 2020, we amended our services agreement with the NBA to include a fan testing program pursuant to which we agreed to make available our COVID-19 tests to all NBA member teams in order to test certain individuals who wish to attend NBA games. Under the agreement, we were a preferred provider of COVID-19 testing for NBA members through the 2020-2021 NBA season, with our testing solution being used by players, their families and referees, at home and on the road. In September 2021, we entered into an agreement with the NBA to make available our testing solution to NBA players, staff, referees and household members as the Official Home and Point of Care Test of the NBA for the 2021-2022 NBA season.
Henry Schein 
In August 2020, we entered into an exclusive distribution and supply agreement with Henry Schein, pursuant to which Henry Schein acts as our exclusive distributor in the dental market and non-exclusive distributor in other markets. Henry Schein is one of the leading distributors of products to the global dental market, with reported sales of approximately $10.1 billion in 2020. The Henry Schein agreement provides for an initial term of three years, unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, and provides for automatic one-year renewals thereafter, subject to either party’s notice of intent not to renew.
Our Growth Strategy
Key elements of our growth strategy include:
•Expand our menu of tests and continue to innovate and enhance our platform. We plan to expand our test menu, including in the fields of respiratory health, sexual health, cardiac and metabolic health, women's health, men's health, and chronic disease management, with several of these tests expected to be submitted for FDA approval or clearance by the end of 2022. Our broad planned future test menu is aimed to appeal to consumers, self-insured employers, and health plans alike and will allow for care that can be personalized to the consumer. We intend to further continue to expand our platform capabilities to provide a comprehensive user experience. 
Table of Contents

•Drive ecosystem adoption. We have been successful in our ability to integrate our platform into existing enterprise-level health management systems, allowing customers to automate workflows while allowing us to garner long-term commercial partnerships. As we enhance our Cue Integrated Care Platform, we intend to extend our integrations with leading EMR systems and to build-out additional capabilities to integrate with telemedicine and digital health providers, e-prescription, e-commerce, and other connected services, to offer consumers a frictionless, virtual-to-physical care solution that positions them for better outcomes
•Continue to expand our installed base and distribution network to enable pull-through of our future extended care offerings. We believe that the ability of customers to experience our platform for COVID-19 testing will facilitate market adoption and awareness that will benefit us as we continue to expand our test menu. We have shipped over 160,000 Cue Readers as of December 31, 2021, but we believe we are just at the beginning of our market adoption. COVID-19 has served as an accelerant for increasing the installed base of our customers, which we believe will drive natural demand to try our additional tests in development. We have significant interest from individuals, enterprises, and healthcare providers to purchase our COVID-19 test as well as interest in our future test menu. We recently rolled out our direct-to-consumer offering, providing retail customers the ability to purchase Cue products directly through our app and website. We further plan to leverage our installed base, established distribution network, and direct customer relationship through our apps to drive sales of our future test menu.
•Increase adoption through value-based selling and payor reimbursement. Our platform enables enterprise customers and payors to capture consistent, convenient and simple diagnostic information to inform key decisions. We believe this will help create positive outcomes for all stakeholders, especially our customers, as we expand our test menu. For example, helping customers test their HbA1c to manage diabetes to determine whether their treatment plan is effective would help payors and enterprises incur fewer costs. We believe this strategy will help accelerate our growth and drive further adoption of our platform.
•Continue to build the Cue brand. We believe that there are significant opportunities to drive increased brand awareness, educate consumers and enterprises on the benefits of diagnostics and our connected health platform, and build a lasting consumer brand. As we continue to invest in marketing, we anticipate that many customers who are not aware of our platform or the benefits of continuous, virtual care will begin using our platform. We further intend to increase our brand awareness through our partnership program. We believe the validation of leading institutions, such as the Mayo Clinic, the NBA and others, will help us to become the testing solution of choice in the enterprise and employer, travel, sports and entertainment, education, personal health and wellness, community and population health, and government market.
•Scale manufacturing capabilities to capitalize on demand. In the fall of 2020, we leased two new manufacturing facilities in an effort to scale our capabilities, and we have since completed 13 new production pods. Our current manufacturing capacity is at a rate of over 20 million Cue Cartridges per year. 
•Expand our global footprint. We believe in the broad suitability of our platform and intend to grow our international customer base. In countries with developed healthcare systems, our value proposition is similar to that of the United States and will offer individuals, enterprises, and healthcare providers with the ability to positively impact health outcomes. In December 2020, our COVID-19 test received the CE mark, clearing it for sale and distribution in the European Union. In April 2021, we received Interim Order authorization from Health Canada to be able to sell and distribute our COVID-19 test and in August 2021 such Interim Order authorization was amended to include both point-of-care and self-testing. In countries with underdeveloped healthcare systems and infrastructure, we believe our platform will be able to provide front-line healthcare providers with access to lab-quality testing to better diagnose and treat underserved patient populations. In June 2021, our COVID-19 test received regulatory approval from the CDSCO for professional point-of-care use in India. In November 2021, we received authorization in Singapore from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for the Cue COVID-19 Test under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR).
Clinical Results
In January 2021, Mayo Clinic Laboratories published the results of an independent clinical validation study that evaluated the clinical performance of our COVID-19 test in Diagnostic Microbiology & Infection Disease, a leading peer-reviewed scientific and medical journal in the fields of clinical microbiology and the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. The study was performed using lower nasal swabs and the results were compared to a reference central laboratory NAAT in 292 symptomatic and asymptomatic adults who were referred for COVID-19 testing in a community drive though collection setting operated by the Mayo Clinic. The study protocol was approved by the Mayo Clinical Institutional Review Board. The samples were collected in August 2020. Patient health status was not collected at the time of testing. The study concluded that Cue COVID-19 test was both sensitive and specific compared to central laboratory testing and that the Cue COVID-19 test for SARS-CoV-2 can be considered a feasible solution to implement at sites requiring a point-of-care solution.

The reference panel testing of 206 patients was conducted using the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay on a Hologic Panther instrument and the reference panel testing of 85 patients was conducted using the Mayo Clinic laboratory for testing by a RT-PCR testing on the Roche Light Cycle 480. The primary outcome was positive and negative percent agreement between the Cue COVID-19 test and the laboratory tests. The Mayo Clinic used a tie-breaker method for any sample with positive result by the laboratory test but a negative test result by the Cue COVID-19 test. If the patient had received testing by more than one reference method within 14 days of study enrollment, the tie-breaker system referred the reference result to be the result obtained by two of the three methods (Cue, Hologic Aptima and laboratory-development RT-PCR). The study did not have a method for resolving all discrepant results observed and an incorrect reference method result cannot be ruled out. It was also not possible to perform a formal limit of detection study due to the design of the assay at that time. Invalid or cancelled results were not able to be retested as directed by the instructions in the Cue COVID-19 test because study participants left the facility before point-of-care testing was completed.
The overall concordance between our COVID-19 test and the reference laboratory test was 97.8%. The positive test agreement between our COVID-19 test and the reference test was 91.7% (22/24) and 95.7% (22/23) when one patient with no tie-breaker method was excluded. The negative test agreement was 98.4% (239/243). There were 25 (8.6%) invalid or cancelled results. Since the time of the study, we have lowered the cut-off value for the internal control that detects the presence of human cellular material in the nasal sample such that 12 invalid results obtained during the study would now return a concordant negative result, and with this change there would have been 13 invalid or cancelled results.
The Mayo Clinic study concluded that the Cue COVID-19 Test Kit using a lower nasal swab collection method is accurate and is both sensitive and specific compared to central laboratory testing using an NPS collection. Additionally, the study noted the Cue COVID-19 Test Kit is easy to use with minimal training or previous laboratory testing experience.
In March 2021, the FDA issued an EUA for the Cue COVID-19 Test Kit for at-home and over-the-counter use without a prescription or physician supervision, making it the first molecular diagnostic test to receive such authorization. In September 2020, the FDA required us to evaluate the analytical limit of detection and to assess the traceability of our COVID-19 test with FDA reference materials. Between December 2020 and February 2021, we conducted prospective studies at four urgent care locations and at two of our own locations to evaluate the use of the Cue COVID-19 Test Kit for at home and over-the-counter use by lay users in a simulated home use environment. Adult lay users (≥18 years of age) self-collected or collected from their child (<18 years of age) a Cue Wand nasal swab and ran the test. Adult and child subjects were enrolled in an “all comers” style at the urgent care locations. A total of 286 subjects were enrolled: 276 adults self-swabbing and self-testing to run the Cue COVID-19 Test Kit for at home and over-the-counter use and 10 children where their parent collected the nasal sample and ran the Cue COVID-19 Test Kit.
There were 38 subjects who tested positive for COVID-19, 233 subjects who tested negative for COVID-19 and 2 subjects with inconclusive results by the FDA Emergency Use Authorized molecular comparator method. Among the subjects, 10 subjects were asymptomatic positive, 123 subjects were asymptomatic negative, and 1 subject was asymptomatic inconclusive by the comparator. In this clinical study, our COVID-19 test correctly identified 96% (27/28) of positive samples from individuals known to have symptoms and correctly identified 100% (10/10) of positive samples from individuals without symptoms. Our COVID-19 test correctly identified 99.1% (231/233) of negative samples. Additionally, in September 2020, we submitted a post-market clinical data report to the FDA as required under our EUA, which included results from the Mayo Clinic's evaluation of Cue versus an institutional reference panel.
Regulatory Status of the Cue COVID-19 Test Kit
In June 2020, the FDA granted us an EUA for our COVID-19 test for point of care use under the supervision of qualified medical personnel. In March 2021, the FDA granted us an additional EUA for over-the-counter and at-home use of our COVID-19 test without a prescription. Our COVID-19 test is authorized for use by both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and by adults and children aged two and older with adult assistance. While commercial sales of our Cue COVID-19 Test Kit are authorized pursuant to our EUA authorizations, to date we have not obtained a 510(k) clearance for our Cue COVID-19 Test Kit, which clearance would be required in the event that the FDA terminates or revokes our EUAs. In order to be eligible to receive 510(k) clearance from the FDA, we will need to conduct additional clinical studies with larger subject enrollment and more COVID-19 positive tests. The 510(k) studies have commenced.
We have an agreement with BARDA which covers the development, EUA and 510(k) clearance of our COVID- 19 Test Kit. There is approximately $5.0 million of funding remaining on this agreement to fund all of the required analytical and clinical studies necessary to complete the procedures to receive 510(k) clearance. We have also contracted with a Clinical Research Organization, or CRO, to conduct the external clinical study with lay users and the external site reproducibility study. We believe the funds from our agreement with BARDA will be sufficient to cover the required expenses, including the approximately $2.5 million CRO contract, to complete the clinical studies necessary to seek 510(k) clearance. We completed

clinical enrollment in February 2022, ahead of schedule, and expect to submit our COVID-19 Test Kit to the FDA for de novo review in the second quarter of 2022 for 510(k) clearance.
Marketing 
Our marketing strategy is focused on building strong brand awareness for the Cue Integrated Care Platform as a next-generation healthcare solution, with relevant, measurable value for all of our customer segments. Our marketing drives across our owned media channels (website and social networks), press releases, scientific publications, industry engagement with key stakeholders, partnerships with key opinion and market leaders, and targeted marketing through digital and non-digital channels. We anticipate investing further, using account-based marketing strategies to accelerate brand awareness and increase demand, and thus sales opportunities, across our targeted markets. 
Sales
Our direct sales team engages with prospective clients and seeks to identify the best sales channel based on each client’s needs. Our go-to-market strategy is focused on allowing us access to the end user, through our Cue Integrated Care Platform, even if the individual was acquired via our direct sales organization or through an outside sales channel. For example, if an individual obtained a Cue Health Monitoring System through their self-insured employer's COVID-19 return-to-work efforts or as a result of government-supported distribution, we can nonetheless directly engage with the end user through the Cue Health App and potentially convert them to using our planned future tests and other products we may develop. As a result, we expect that we will be able to fulfill market demand through our internal and external sales channels, while maintaining an important direct relationship for our product enhancements and care offerings. 
Additionally, our relationship with U.S. DoD formed an important foundation of our initial go-to-market strategy. Our relationship with U.S. DoD helped establish our domestic manufacturing infrastructure as a critical component of ongoing national healthcare infrastructure. Our relationship with the U.S. DoD also helped commercialize the Cue Health Monitoring System as part of a critical, decentralized national diagnostic infrastructure for ongoing pandemic management. In addition, the development of Cue Readers alongside Cue COVID-19 Test Kits, has significantly accelerated our installed base growth, which we believe will enable continued distribution of our Cue COVID-19 Test Kit as well as pull-through of our planned future Cue Test Kits to key federal, state and local government agencies. Through the U.S. DoD agreement, the Cue Health Monitoring System and Cue COVID-19 Test Kits have been deployed to at least 18 states, thousands of schools, nursing homes, hospitals, essential businesses, correctional facilities, underserved communities, public health facilities and organizations as well as other public sector users, as of December 31, 2021. 
Our direct sales team is comprised of experienced sales professionals focused on the following four categories:
•Public Sector Sales: Our public sector sales team identifies new opportunities within federal, state and local government agencies. While we expect that revenue from other categories of customers will become a larger component of revenue over time, our public sector sales strategy continues to look to identify opportunities with new and existing federal, state and local government agency customers.
•Enterprise Sales: Our enterprise sales team identifies major self-insured enterprises, such as Fortune 500 companies with large-covered employee populations, as well as small to medium sized businesses with healthcare plans partners and employee benefits offerings. We believe that enterprise customers will want to utilize our integrated care solutions for their employees and their families, both on-premise and at-home. 
•Healthcare Provider Sales: Our healthcare provider sales strategy targets major healthcare systems and healthcare professionals such as hospital systems, private clinics and concierge health systems, and physicians’ offices. Relationships with our customers, like our current relationship with the Mayo Clinic, help validate our platform, and we believe will help accelerate marketplace adoption of our products. 
•Direct-to-Consumer Sales: Our direct-to-consumer sales team identifies opportunities through online and offline retail channels such as e-commerce and future opportunities for in-store sales.
Our customer agreements contain standard commercial terms and conditions and include payment terms, quantities, billing frequency, warranties and indemnification. Beginning in 2021, we started offering non-U.S. government customers a subscription-based purchasing option. Subscription-based customers can initially purchase a fixed number of Cue Readers at the start of the contract and commit to a fixed number of our Cue COVID-19 Test Kits per month for the duration of the subscription agreement. We believe our subscription-based model offers customers maximum utility and allows them to reduce their purchase costs, while simultaneously creating a recurring revenue stream for us. 
Table of Contents

We believe focused efforts on each of our customer categories is critical given the unique role each plays in the healthcare ecosystem, the total size of their respective addressable markets and the potential benefits that each receive from our platform. Although our initial focus is driving adoption of our Cue Health Monitoring System and our Cue COVID-19 Test Kits, we are educating all of our current and prospective customers about the broad applicability of our Cue Integrated Care Platform and the potential roll-out of our broader test kit menu. 
Research and Development
The primary focus of our research and development effort has evolved over time. The work to get certain of our tests into the late-stage technical development phase for the general immunoassay modality and certain specific immunoassays (including fertility, pregnancy, and inflammation) was largely complete prior to a shift of our focus in mid-2018. At that time, we refocused our efforts on improving the NAAT modality within our platform and completing our first automated production line, initially used to build Cue Cartridges for research and development purposes. The primary target within NAAT from mid-2018 was respiratory infectious disease testing, in particular, influenza. The focus on influenza (which also helped advance our very similar RSV test) lasted until COVID-19 came to the forefront in early 2020. Research and development efforts shifted fully to developing our COVID-19 test in March of 2020 when our clinical study sites for influenza were closed to those with respiratory illness symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 remained our focus through most of 2020. Starting in early 2021, we began to shift our research and development efforts to finalizing our tests in late-stage technical development and restarting development on tests in earlier stages.
Our research and development strategy continues to focus on developing gold-standard diagnostic science that seamlessly integrates with a connected, end-to-end digital platform. Our platform was developed over a ten-year period in our San Diego, California facilities. All of our core technology, including the chemistry, the Cue Reader and Cue Cartridge design, the Cue Health App and Cue Enterprise Dashboard is proprietary and developed in-house by us. 
Our research and development team, which includes our clinical and reagent production team members, is responsible for the design, functionality and quality of our products and services. Our team is interdisciplinary in nature, including scientists, statisticians, chemists, engineers and regulatory experts.
Vertically-Integrated Manufacturing Solutions 
Our manufacturing facilities were developed alongside our science and technology and are vertically-integrated, fully automated and scalable. Our integrated manufacturing and bioproduction gives us complete control over the quality of our finished product.
We own and control the intellectual property that makes the platform possible. Our manufacturing process is replicable, and our manufacturing production pods can produce any type of test in our expected future test menu. We believe our manufacturing capabilities are differentiated and allow us not only to scale quickly and efficiently, but also to adapt our production quickly to market demands or evolving consumer needs. 
We produce our Cue Cartridges in-house, including critical enzymes, antibodies, and primers for the test cartridges. We have complete production oversight and quality control over finished products and protection against global fluctuations in supply chain and costs. We achieve this by manufacturing all of our Cue Cartridges in our state-of-the-art facilities in San Diego, California using our modular, scalable production pods. Our fully automated production pods build raw components into fully assembled, packaged cartridges. 
Our Cue Readers are manufactured by our partners. Our Cue Wands are manufactured by us or our partners. For our Cue Readers and Cue Wands, we own and control all of the intellectual property developed by us and rely on multiple suppliers. 
On October 13, 2020, we announced a $480.9 million agreement with the U.S. DoD, on behalf of U.S. HHS, to expand our U.S.-based production capacity and deploy six million Cue COVID-19 Test Kits by March 2021, which agreement with the U.S. DoD was subsequently amended in March 2021 to require delivery by October 2021 and further amended in September 2021 to extend the date to December 31, 2021. This agreement included an upfront payment of $184.6 million to scale our manufacturing. This payment was intended to help us onshore our supply chain and rapidly increase our production capacity to enable and support domestic production of critical medical resources. In connection with this effort, we were able to rapidly scale our production, going from producing hundreds of Cue Cartridges per day to tens of thousands in a matter of months.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our commercially important technology, inventions and know-how, including our Cue Reader, our Cue Cartridge, and our Cue 
Table of Contents

Wand; to defend and enforce our patents; to operate without infringing, misappropriating or violating the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or violating our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret laws, and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Notwithstanding these efforts, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we have filed or may license or file in the future, and we cannot be sure that any patents we own or license or patents that may be licensed or granted to us in the future will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our test kits and technology. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
As of December 31, 2021, we owned twenty-two (22) issued U.S. utility patents, four (4) pending U.S. utility patent applications, thirty-five (35) issued foreign utility patents (including patents in Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and various European countries), and twenty-five (25) pending foreign utility patent applications (including pending PCT applications). 
Our utility patents and patent applications are directed to many different aspects of our platform. By way of example, our granted patents and pending patent applications cover various structural features of our Cue Cartridge, sensors within the Cue Cartridge for use in detecting target analytes, systems and methods for analyte detection and quantification, and our Cue Reader. 
The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term for a utility patent is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a nonprovisional patent application in the applicable country. Our issued U.S. and foreign utility patents are anticipated to naturally expire between 2034 and 2038, and our U.S. pending utility patent applications and pending PCT applications, if issued into patents, are anticipated to naturally expire between 2034 and 2041, excluding any additional patent term adjustment(s) or extension(s), and assuming payment of all applicable maintenance or annuity fees. Once a patent expires, patent protection ends and an invention enters the public domain allowing anyone to commercially exploit the invention without infringing the patent. 
In addition, we hold design patents and patent applications that cover various ornamental features of our Cue Reader, our Cue Cartridge, and our Cue Wand. As of December 31, 2021, we owned nine (9) granted U.S. design patents, two (2) pending U.S. design patent applications, thirty-six (36) granted foreign design patents and design registrations (with protection in Canada, China, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the European Union), and four (4) pending foreign design applications. Our granted U.S. design patents are anticipated to naturally expire between 2029 and 2036. Our foreign design patents and design registrations are anticipated to naturally expire between 2024 and 2042.
We cannot guarantee that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology. Notwithstanding the scope of the patent protection available to us, a competitor could develop methods or devices that are not covered by our patents or circumvent these patents. Furthermore, because patent applications can take many years to publish, there may be applications unknown to us which may result in issued patents that our existing or future products or technologies may be alleged to infringe.
We also rely upon trademarks to build and maintain the integrity of our brand. As of December 31, 2021, we owned three (3) U.S. trademark registrations, forty-four (44) foreign trademark registrations (including registrations in China, Hong Kong, the European Union, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, and Singapore), and two (2) pending trademark applications in Mexico. We also rely, in part, on unpatented trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and confidential information, to develop and maintain our competitive position and protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. However, such proprietary rights are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality and assignment agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to our proprietary information. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have implemented measures to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors or misused by any collaborator to whom we disclose such information. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our Cue Health Monitoring System or any of our current or expected future tests or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

Competition
We do not believe there are currently any competitors that offer the portable, intuitive, accurate and connected platform provided we provide, comprised of the Cue Health Monitoring System and associated tests, our Cue Health App and our Cue Enterprise Dashboard. That said, the traditional diagnostic testing industry is highly competitive and rapidly changing. For our Cue COVID-19 Test specifically, we expect ongoing intense competition from different sources, including from manufacturers and producers of diagnostic tests, as well as vaccines and therapeutic treatments that may decrease demand for COVID-19 tests. Notably, however, we are the first molecular COVID-19 test approved for at-home and over-the-counter use without a prescription. As we broaden our test menu, we expect ongoing intense competition from companies that develop or have already developed molecular tests, whether for at-home and over-the-counter use or at the point-of-care, as well as companies that have or are developing antigen and antibody tests. While we believe that our differentiated technology, customer-centric design, and vertically-integrated manufacturing provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including public and private companies, academic institutions, public and private research institutions and governmental agencies.
Competitors with diagnostic testing platforms include private and public companies, such as Abbott Laboratories, Becton, Dickinson and Company, BioMerieux SA, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Danaher Corp., Ellume Limited, Everly Health, Inc., F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., Fluidigm Corporation, GenMark Diagnostics Inc., Ginkgo Bioworks, Inc., Mammoth Biosciences, Inc., LetsGetChecked, Lucira Health, Inc., Qiagen N.V., Quidel Corporation, Sherlock Biosciences, Inc., Siemens AG, Talis Biomedical Corporation, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. and Visby Medical, Inc. as well as several retailers, such as The Kroger Company, Walmart Inc. and Alberstons Companies, Inc. Large lab companies like Quest Diagnostics, Inc. and Laboratory Corporation of America have also expanded beyond centralized laboratory testing into at-home sample collection. 
As we expand our service offerings, we anticipate integrating with a variety of technology platforms. These platforms may have products or services that compete with our offerings, and include companies such as 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (d/b/a OneMedical), American Well, Inc., Hims & Hers Health, Inc., and Teladoc Health, Inc. We may also face competition from other companies, including other technology companies. For example, it has been publicly reported that Amazon.com, Inc. may be considering launching an at-home diagnostic testing business. 
Many of the companies we currently compete with or which we may compete with in the future have significantly greater financial resources and more experience in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical development, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved tests. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, whether independently or with strategic partners. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
We believe key competitive factors impacting our success in the market include accuracy of results, ease-of-use, accessibility, time to result, clinical performance, pricing, ability to meet consumer demand, and reimbursement levels.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
Our products are manufactured within our facilities in San Diego and at other third party locations. Our products contain some components and raw materials that we purchase globally from single-source direct and indirect suppliers, some without long-term supply agreements, such as electronic components and certain chemical reagents. We do, however, periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical components in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. See the applicable risk factor in Item 1.A. “Risk Factors” for an additional description of this risk.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,585 full-time employees. Our employees are primarily located in the San Diego, California area. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
Facilities
Table of Contents

We follow Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, guidelines and are ISO 13485 certified, the key certification for medical device manufacturing, providing confidence and assurance in our final product. We are routinely audited to maintain our ISO 13485:2016 status.
During the fall of 2020, we launched a significant expansion of our manufacturing capacity, leasing an approximately 197,000 square-foot facility in Vista, California and an approximately 63,000 square-foot facility in San Diego, California. As of December 31, 2021, the Vista facility was producing cartridges from seven production pods (with space for an additional three production pods) and is serving as our warehousing and distribution hub. Our Waples facility serves as a second reagent production hub, houses certain cartridge component manufacturing, and has space for five production pods, all of which are currently in operation. Our Nancy Ridge facility is also producing cartridges from two production pods. We believe our current facilities are sufficient to meet our current needs, and that we will be able to find appropriate space for expansion when appropriate. Our Vista facility lease expires on July 1, 2026 and our Waples facility lease expires on July 1, 2031. Both leases have options to extend.
Government Regulation
Regulation of Medical Devices in the United States
The development, testing, manufacturing, marketing, post-market surveillance, distribution, advertising and labeling of medical devices are subject to regulation in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and comparable state agencies. Unless subject to an exemption, medical devices must receive from the FDA prior to marketing either clearance of a premarket notification, known as 510(k), or premarket approval (PMA) pursuant to the FDCA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes based upon their risk profile: Class I devices are relatively simple “low risk” technologies that can be manufactured and distributed with general controls without a premarket clearance or approval from the FDA; Class II devices are somewhat more complex “moderate risk” devices that require greater scrutiny from the FDA and require premarket clearance from the FDA before market entry; and Class III devices are “high risk” technologies inserted or implanted in the body, intended to treat life sustaining functions. Class III technologies require premarket approval from the FDA before market entry. If we are required to submit our products for pre-market review by the FDA, we may be required to delay marketing and commercialization while we obtain premarket clearance or approval from the FDA. There would be no assurance that we could ever obtain such clearance or approval.
All medical devices that are regulated by the FDA are also subject to the quality system regulation. Obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals, including the FDA quality system inspections that are required for PMA approval, can be expensive and may involve considerable delay. The regulatory approval process for such products may be delayed, may be more expensive than anticipated, and may conclude without such products being approved by the FDA. Without timely regulatory approval, we will not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such diagnostic products. Changes to the current regulatory framework, including the imposition of additional or new regulations, could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products. This may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain FDA or comparable regulatory clearance or approval of our products in the future. In addition, the FDA may introduce new requirements that may change the regulatory requirements for us or our customers, or both.
Emergency Use Authorization
In emergency situations, such as a pandemic, the FDA has the authority to authorize unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of cleared or approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear warfare threat agents when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.
Under this authority, the FDA may issue an Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) for an unapproved device if certain statutory criteria are met. Once granted, an EUA will remain in effect and generally terminate on the earlier of a determination that the public health emergency has ceased or a change in the approval status of the product. After the EUA is no longer valid, the product is no longer considered to be legally marketed and one of the FDA’s non-emergency premarket pathways would be necessary to resume or continue distribution of the subject product. The FDA also may revise or revoke an EUA if the circumstances justifying its issuance no longer exist, the criteria for its issuance are no longer met, or other circumstances make a revision or revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety.
On February 4, 2020, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19. We received an EUA from the FDA on June 10, 2020 (designated as EUA 200248) for our Cue COVID-19 Test Kit for use at the point-of-care with specimens collected using the Cue Wand from 
Table of Contents

individuals who are suspected of having COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. On August 20, 2020, the FDA granted an amendment to our EUA to add testing of previously collected nasal specimens in viral transport media from individuals who are suspected of having COVID-19 by their healthcare provider and to update the test protocol and Quick Reference Index to include instructions for the new specimen type. On March 26, 2021, in response to Cue Health’s request, the FDA re-issued our June 10, 2020 EUA No. 200248 to include the previously authorized indication and intended use along with the August 20, 2020 amendments, and revised the EUA to update the indication, intended use, and conditions of authorization. We received a second EUA from the FDA on March 5, 2021 (designated as EUA Number 210180) for our Cue COVID-19 Test Kit for home and over-the-counter use without a prescription with specimens collected using the Cue Wand from adults or children greater than or equal to two years of age (swabbed by an adult) with or without symptoms or other epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19. Both EUAs are subject to certain Conditions of Authorization as listed in each EUA letter, including but not limited to conditions related to advertising, printed materials, and promotion.
510(k) Clearance Marketing Pathway
We expect that many of our future tests will require clearance under 510(k) regulatory pathway, unless exempted or otherwise authorized pursuant to an EUA. Our current products are Class II medical devices and, but for the immediate ability to seek an EUA, would be subject to premarket notification and clearance requirements under section 510(k) of the FDCA. To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit to the FDA a 510(k) submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, known as a “predicate device.” A legally marketed predicate device may include a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (a pre-amendment device), a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (1) the same technological characteristics, or (2) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate device. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. Once the 510(k) submission is accepted for review, the FDA has 90 calendar days by regulation to review and issue a determination. As a practical matter, clearance may take and often takes longer. Upon review, the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, the FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees and for medical device establishments. For fiscal year 2021, the standard user fee for a 510(k) premarket notification application is $12,745.
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, for example, due to a finding of a lack of a predicate device, that the device has a new intended use or different technological characteristics that raise different questions of safety or effectiveness when the device is compared to the cited predicate device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. If the FDA determines that the information provided in a 510(k) submission is insufficient to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the predicate device, the FDA generally identifies the specific information that needs to be provided so that the FDA may complete its evaluation of substantial equivalence, and such information may be provided within the time allotted by the FDA or in a new 510(k) submission should the original 510(k) submission have been withdrawn.
After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a “letter to file” in which the manufacturer documents the rationale for the change and why a new 510(k) submission is not required. However, the FDA may review such letters to file to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. 
PMA Approval Pathway
None of our tests are currently approved under PMA, nor are we currently seeking approval under a PMA for our Cue COVID-19 Test or any additional test. However, we may in the future develop devices which could require the approval of PMA. Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed in the U.S. The PMA process is generally more 
Table of Contents

demanding than the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials demonstrating that the device is safe and effective. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review may take and often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years.
De Novo Classification
To market low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, a manufacturer may request a de novo classification. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. A medical device may be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent or a manufacturer may request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. The FDA is required to classify the device within 120 calendar days following receipt of the de novo application, although in practice, the FDA’s review may take significantly longer. In the event the FDA determines the data and information submitted demonstrate that general controls or general and special controls are adequate to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, the FDA will grant the de novo request for classification. When the FDA grants a de novo request for classification, the device is granted marketing authorization and further can serve as a predicate for future devices of that type, through a 510(k) premarket notification.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are typically required to support a PMA, oftentimes for a de novo request for classification, and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must be approved prior to commencing clinical trials. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. A clinical trial may begin 30 days after receipt of the IDE by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin.
In addition, the clinical trials must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical trial are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all applicable reporting and record keeping requirements.
Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a clinical trial is completed, there can be no assurance that the data generated during a clinical trial will meet the safety and effectiveness endpoints or otherwise produce results that will lead the FDA to grant marketing clearance or approval.
Post-market Regulation
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include establishment registration and device listing requirements; Quality System Regulation (QSR) requirements; labeling and advertising regulations; product modification requirements; medical device reporting regulations; product correction, and recall regulations; and post-market surveillance activities.
Advertising and promotion of medical devices are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the 
Table of Contents

federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. In general, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any number of sanctions including warning letters, fines, injunctions, production suspension, and/or civil and criminal penalties.
Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments of 1988
CLIA Regulations Relating to In Vitro Diagnostic Tests 
The Cue Health Monitoring system and our Cue COVID-19 Test also are subject to categorization by the FDA pursuant to CLIA and its implementing regulations in the United States which establish quality standards for all laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test is performed. A laboratory is broadly defined to include any facility that performs laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or the impairment of, or assessment of health. CLIA regulations establish standards for proficiency testing; facility administration; general laboratory systems; pre-analytic, analytic systems, post-analytic systems; personnel qualifications and responsibilities; quality control, quality assessment; and specific provisions for laboratories performing moderate to high complexity tests. 
The regulations promulgated under CLIA establish three levels of in vitro diagnostic tests: (1) waived; (2) moderately complex; and (3) highly complex. When a test is categorized as waived, it may be performed by laboratories that have a Certificate of Waiver.
Tests that are waived by the CLIA regulations are automatically categorized as waived following 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. Otherwise, following clearance or approval, the FDA will classify in vitro diagnostics in accordance with the CLIA regulations. Manufacturers of clinical laboratory test systems, such as in vitro diagnostics, that are categorized as moderate complexity according to the CLIA categorization criteria may request categorization of the text as waived through a CLIA Waiver by Application submission to FDA. Waived tests are simple laboratory examinations and procedures that have an insignificant risk of an erroneous result, including those that (A) employ methodologies that are so simple and accurate as to render the likelihood of erroneous results negligible or (B) FDA has determined pose no reasonable risk of harm to patients if the examinations or procedures are performed incorrectly. These tests are waived from regulatory oversight of the user other than the requirement to follow the manufacturer’s labeling and directions for use. Further, when FDA authorizes tests for use at the point-of-care under an EUA, such tests are deemed to be CLIA waived tests. As such, such tests can be performed in a patient care setting that is qualified to have the test performed there as a result of operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver for the duration of the emergency declaration. We are also required to maintain a license to conduct testing in California. California laws establish standards for day-to-day operation of our clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control. We provide testing services only to our employees, visitors, and contractors and do not provide laboratory testing services for purposes other than operation of our business.
Licensing and Regulation of Medical Device Manufacturers and Distributors
We are licensed by the California Department of Public Health as a medical device manufacturer. As a medical device manufacturer, one of the criteria is that Our Quality Management System, or QMS, holds an ISO 13485:2016 certificate. The ISO is an independent, non-governmental international organization that defines world-class specifications for products, services and systems, to ensure quality, safety and efficiency. ISO 13485:2016 is a harmonized, international regulatory benchmark for quality management systems that addresses most or all of the QMS requirements in markets including the United States, European Union, Australia, Japan and Canada. The ISO 13485:2016 certificate confirms that an organization operates a QMS that conforms to the standards established by ISO. The FDA recently proposed a rule to harmonize and modernize its QSR, which would supplant the existing requirements with ISO 13485:2016.
In addition, we may be required to obtain additional licenses as we increase our direct sale and distribution of tests. Medical device manufacturers who distribute over-the-counter devices are subject to complex and varying state licensing requirements that can attach to their manufacturing and/or distribution activity. While some states have no licensing regimen for medical device manufacturing and distribution at all, others, such as California, regulate certain types of distribution activity. For example, California separately licenses home use medical device retail facilities. Massachusetts has codified a Code of Conduct that applies to any entity that employs or contracts with any person to sell or market prescription drugs or medical 
Table of Contents

devices in Massachusetts. In preparation for our expansion of direct marketing of its home use tests, we are reviewing state regulatory requirements that may apply to us as a medical device manufacturer or distributor.
European Medical Device Regulation
Sales of in vitro diagnostics in the European Economic Area are subject to the European regulatory framework. The time required to obtain clearance or approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may be different. Set forth below are highlights of the key European regulatory schemes applicable to our business.
European Conformity Marking (“CE Mark”) and Certifications
In order to place an in vitro diagnostic, or an accessory to an in vitro diagnostic, on the market in the European Union/European Economic Area, the device must be designed, developed, manufactured, and marketed in compliance with the relevant legal framework. Currently, in vitro diagnostics must be compliant with Directive 98/79/EEC, or the Directive; however, from May 26, 2022 Regulation (EU) 2017/746, or the Regulation, will replace the Directive. While the Regulation will have direct effect in all European Economic Area countries, the Directive required national implementing legislation in each country, which had historically led to some variation in the regimes in each country.
Prior to May 26, 2022, in vitro diagnostics that have been assessed for conformity with the requirements of the Directive, including notably the “essential requirements” set out in Annex I of the Directive, are entitled to bear a CE Mark indicating that the device conforms to the standards required by the Directive. In vitro diagnostics that have been CE marked may be placed on the market throughout the Member States of the European Union and the European Economic Area, and other countries that comply with or mirror the Directive.
The method of assessing conformity of in vitro diagnostics will depend on the type and classification of the in vitro diagnostic. For in vitro diagnostics that are in the lowest risk classification (meaning that they do not appear in the list set out in Annex II of the Directive nor are they used for the purpose of self-testing by the user/patient), the manufacturer can self-assess that the in vitro diagnostics comply with the essential requirements in the Directive without any review or intervention by any regulatory body and/or third-party. In doing so, the manufacturer must comply with Common Technical Specifications adopted by the European Commission for certain diagnostic tests, unless they can justify not doing so. The manufacturer may choose to comply with harmonized technical standards adopted by European standards bodies. Although compliance with these standards is not mandatory, compliance raises a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements that each standard addresses.
Once the manufacturer has gathered the technical documentation necessary to demonstrate this in the form of a technical file, it must draw up a declaration of conformity and can then affix a CE Mark to the device and place it on the market. The only additional requirements are (i) that the manufacturer (or its authorized representative if the manufacturer is outside the European Economic Area) must maintain a copy of the relevant technical file, so that it can be inspected by national device regulators; (ii) that the manufacturer and, where relevant, its authorized representative must register themselves and their in vitro diagnostics, so that these authorities know when the products are to be marketed; and (iii) that the manufacturer must perform device vigilance to monitor the safety and performance of the in vitro diagnostics on the market, reporting both adverse incidents and any field safety corrective actions, or FSCAs, to the authorities, as appropriate. Challenges by European regulatory authorities may arise subsequently if there is an issue related to the compliance, safety or performance of the device. Such challenges may arise from a routine audit or enquiry by a regulatory authority or following device vigilance reports by the company or others, or reports of FSCAs by the company, or complaints made by competitors.
Under the Directive, any in vitro diagnostic that is for self-testing or that appears in Annex II (meaning that these devices cannot use the self-certification process) must have their compliance with the Directive reviewed and certified by a European Notified Body. Notified bodies are usually private, non-governmental, independent bodies that are authorized/licensed by governmental authorities to perform conformity assessments. They enter into a contractual arrangement with manufacturers to carry out the conformity assessment of in vitro diagnostics. The Notified Body will review the technical documentation, including assessing the available clinical evidence, literature data for the product and any available post-market experience. There is some flexibility regarding the conformity assessment procedure the manufacturer uses. If the manufacturer decides to base its conformity assessment on an assessment of its Full Quality Assurance System (rather than a more product-focused “Type Examination”), the Notified Body will also perform an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system against an international standard, EN ISO 13485:2016. If the Notified Body deems the in vitro diagnostic (and where applicable the manufacturer’s quality system) conforms to the Directive it will issue a certificate of conformity for the device and, where applicable, a certificate of conformity for the manufacturer’s quality system, which the manufacturer can use as the basis for its declaration of conformity, then affix a CE Mark and thus place the in vitro diagnostic on the market in the European Union / European Economic Area.

On May 26, 2017 the Regulation entered into force and, from May 26, 2022, the Regulation will apply and will replace the Directive. From that date, in vitro diagnostics should have been assessed for conformity with the Regulation and should not be CE marked and placed on the market unless they are in compliance. However, the Regulation provides for a transition period that allows manufacturers or products that benefit from certificates of conformity issued by European Notified Bodies under the Directive prior to May 26, 2022 to continue to place those products on the market until May 26, 2024. Where they have been placed on the market prior to that date, they may then be distributed and supplied to end-users until May 26, 2025. However, this transition period does not apply to in vitro diagnostics that have undergone manufacturer self-certification nor does it to products that benefit from Notified Body certificates of conformity but where the manufacturer has made significant changes to a device since the certificate was issued. These products must be in compliance with the Regulation from May 26, 2022, or from the date of the change if that occurs prior to May 26, 2024.
As with the Directive, the Regulation requires that in vitro diagnostics must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, have a declaration of conformity drawn up and bear the CE Mark before a manufacturer can place them on the European Union / European Economic Area market. However, the Regulation will up-classify many in vitro diagnostics that the Directive currently allows manufacturers to self-assess and declare conformity, so that the vast majority of in vitro diagnostics, including all diagnostic tests, will require a European Notified Body conformity assessment as part of the conformity assessment process. In practice, manufacturers may only be able to self-assess and declare the conformity of consumables and apparatus that are regulated as in vitro diagnostics but are not the tests themselves. The Regulation will also provide for greater use of common specifications that are presumed to be binding, unless a manufacturer can justify not doing so.
Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom continued to follow the same regulations as the European Union during a Transition Period until the end of 2020. Now that the Transition Period has ended, the United Kingdom has implemented Directive 98/79/EC into U.K. law (along with other European Union legislation on medical devices) through the Medical Devices Regulations 2002. Therefore, the two regulatory systems are independent but currently broadly aligned (although under the Northern Irish Protocol, the European Union regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The United Kingdom has implemented certain new regulatory requirements, including that all medical devices and in vitro diagnostics must be registered with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority before being placed on the market in Great Britain. There is a grace period to allow time for compliance with the new registration process, with higher risk devices (i.e. List A products) requiring registration by May 1, 2021, and lower risk devices requiring registration later in 2021 (List B products from September 1, 2021 and general in vitro diagnostics from January 1, 2022). CE marking will continue to be recognized in Great Britain for medical devices until June 30, 2023, following which a UK Conformity Assessment mark will be required for a medical device or in vitro diagnostic device to be marketed in Great Britain. The new European Union medical device and in vitro diagnostics regulations will not apply in Great Britain and it remains uncertain at present how the U.K. regulatory regime will change in future and the extent to which it will diverge from European Union regulations.
Privacy Regulation
U.S. Privacy Regulation
The HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the transmission, security and privacy of protected health information by covered entities subject to HIPAA, such as health plans, health care clearinghouses and healthcare providers, and their respective business associates that access protected health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
In addition, in the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. For example, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the CCPA, which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, was recently voted into law by California residents. The CPRA significantly amends the CCPA, and imposes additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data.
Table of Contents

While we are not currently subject to the CCPA or the CPRA, we may in the future be required to comply with the CCPA or the CPRA, which may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Furthermore, the CCPA and CPRA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent state privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.
Other International Privacy and Security Regulations
The collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA), including personal health data, is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), or the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EEA, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. The GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities. Further, the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the EU, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. As of January 1, 2021, and the expiry of transitional arrangements agreed to between the United Kingdom and EU, data processing in the United Kingdom is governed by a United Kingdom version of the GDPR (combining the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018), exposing us to two parallel regimes, each of which potentially authorizes similar fines and other potentially divergent enforcement actions for certain violations. There will be increasing scope for divergence in application, interpretation and enforcement of the data protection law as between the United Kingdom and EEA.
U.S. Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws
U.S. Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
A variety of state and federal laws prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services, the OIG, and various state agencies. In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly use a variety of contractors to review claims data and to identify improper payments as well as fraud and abuse. Any overpayments must be repaid within 60 days of identification unless a favorable decision is obtained on appeal. In some cases, these overpayments can be used as the basis for an extrapolation, by which the error rate is applied to a larger set of claims, and which can result in even higher repayments.. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws.
Anti-Kickback Statutes. The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program. “Remuneration” is broadly defined to include anything of monetary value, such as, for example, cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies or equipment. The Anti-Kickback Statute can be interpreted broadly to prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry. Recognizing the potential breadth of interpretation of the Anti-Kickback Statute and the fact that it may technically prohibit many otherwise innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the OIG has issued a series of regulations, or safe harbors intended to protect such arrangements. Compliance with all requirements of a safe harbor immunizes the parties to the business arrangement from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a business arrangement to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the arrangement is illegal or that the OIG will pursue prosecution but would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Still, in the absence of an applicable safe harbor, a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may occur even if only one purpose of an arrangement is to induce referrals. The penalties for violating the Anti-Kickback Statute can be severe. These sanctions include criminal, civil and administrative penalties, imprisonment and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-
Table of Contents

Kickback Statute, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payor, including private third-party payors. Further, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018, or EKRA, prohibits payments for referrals to recovery homes, clinical treatment facilities, and laboratories. EKRA’s reach extends beyond federal health care programs to include private insurance (i.e., it is an “all payor” statute). For purposes of EKRA, the term “laboratory” is defined broadly and without reference to any connection to substance use disorder treatment. The law includes a limited number of exceptions, some of which closely align with corresponding federal Anti-Kickback Statute exceptions and safe harbors, and others that materially differ. 
State and Federal False Claims Laws. The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he or she has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information. Specific intent to defraud is not required. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action. Penalties include payment of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus significant civil penalties, as well as possible exclusion from federal health care programs. In addition, various states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state health care programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to any payor.

Physician Self-Referral Bans. The federal ban on physician self-referrals, commonly known as the Stark Law, prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare patients to an entity providing certain designated health services, which include laboratory services, if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationship with the entity. Several Stark Law exceptions are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including but not limited to: (1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; (2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; (3) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that satisfy certain requirements; and (4) personal services arrangements. Penalties for violating the Stark Law include the return of funds received for all prohibited referrals, fines, civil monetary penalties and possible exclusion from federal health care programs. In addition to the Stark Law, many states have their own self-referral bans, which may extend to all self-referrals, regardless of the payor.
Civil Monetary Penalties Law. The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or the CMP Law, prohibits, among other things, (1) the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; (2) employing or contracting with an individual or entity that the provider knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal health care program; (3) billing for services requested by an unlicensed physician or an excluded provider; and (4) billing for medically unnecessary services. The penalties for violating the CMP Law include exclusion, substantial fines, and payment of up to three times the amount billed, depending on the nature of the offense.
Transparency Laws and Regulations. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other “transfers of value” to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers will also be required to report information and transfers of value provided (beginning in 2021) to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. Failure to submit timely, accurate and complete reports may result in substantial monetary penalties. We are or will be subject to the Open Payments Program and the information we disclose may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs. Additionally, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals.
International Fraud and Abuse Laws 
In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines, for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offense. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act 2010, a bribe occurs when a person offers, gives or 
Table of Contents

promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. We are also required to maintain accurate information on and control over sales and distributors’ activities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring them to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
Medicare is a federal program administered by CMS through Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs. Available to people age 65 or over, and certain other people, Medicare provides, among other things, healthcare benefits that cover, within prescribed limits, the major costs of most medically necessary care for such people, subject to certain deductibles and copayments.
CMS has established guidelines for the coverage and reimbursement of certain products and procedures by Medicare. In general, in order to be reimbursed by Medicare, a healthcare procedure furnished to a Medicare beneficiary must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury, or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part. The methodology for determining coverage status and the amount of Medicare reimbursement varies based upon, among other factors, the setting in which a Medicare beneficiary received healthcare products and services. The reimbursement rate for certain services, including clinical laboratory services, is established under fee schedules that are developed and periodically updated pursuant to specific statutory or regulatory provisions. Any changes in federal legislation, regulations and policy affecting CMS coverage and reimbursement relative to the procedure using our Cue Health Monitoring System and our current and future tests (once approved) could have a material effect on our performance.
CMS also administers the Medicaid program, a cooperative federal/state program that provides medical assistance benefits to qualifying low income and medically needy people. State participation in Medicaid is optional, and each state is given discretion in developing and administering its own Medicaid program, subject to certain federal requirements pertaining to payment levels, eligibility criteria and minimum categories of services. The coverage, method and level of reimbursement vary from state to state and is subject to each state’s budget restraints. Changes to the availability of coverage, method or level of reimbursement for relevant procedures may affect future revenue negatively if reimbursement amounts are decreased or discontinued.
All CMS programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate adjustments, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy, intermediary determinations, and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease the rate of program payments to healthcare facilities and other healthcare providers.
U.S. Health Reform
Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenue and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future products once approved. The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our Cue Health Monitoring System and any of our current or future tests profitably once approved. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our Cue Health Monitoring System and any of our current or future tests once approved. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our Cue Health Monitoring System and our current and future tests once approved.

By way of example, the U.S. federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”), which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government healthcare programs.
Since enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate'' was repealed by Congress as part of legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court held that the states and individuals that brought the lawsuit challenging the ACA's individual mandate do not have standing to challenge the law. The Supreme Court did not reach the merits of the challenge, but the decision ends the case. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden Administration will impact the ACA. 
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations
We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and permitting and licensing requirements. Such laws include those governing laboratory practices, the generation, storage, use, manufacture, handling, transportation, treatment, remediation, release and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and wastes and worker health and safety. Our operations involve the generation, use, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, and the risk of injury, contamination or non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or permitting or licensing requirements cannot be eliminated. In particular, the introduction of our COVID-19 test requires that we maintain compliance with applicable and evolving federal and state laws and regulations relating to COVID-19, including the generation, use, storage, and disposal of testing materials and agents. agents. To date, compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our business.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we are or may become involved in legal proceedings. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, reputational harm and other factors, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. 
In February 2018, the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Enforcement issued a subpoena to us requesting certain documents and information. The SEC’s subpoena called for the production of documents and information, including documents and information related to one of our prior private financing rounds. We have been cooperating fully with the SEC’s investigation. At this time, however, we cannot predict the outcome of this investigation as to us or our officers, nor can we predict the timing associated with any such conclusion or resolution. Based on information currently known to us, we do not believe the SEC’s investigation will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, we cannot assure you that we will not be required to devote significant time or resources to resolving the SEC investigation, or that the ultimate resolution of the investigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are not currently a party to any other legal proceedings that we believe may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
