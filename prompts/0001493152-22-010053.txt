Item 1. Business
Overview
 
The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1987 as Cortex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and changed its name to RespireRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. in 2015.
 
The mission of the Company is to develop innovative and revolutionary treatments to combat disorders caused by disruption of neuronal signaling. We are developing treatment options that address conditions affecting millions of people, but for which there are limited or poor treatment options, including obstructive sleep apnea (“OSA”), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), epilepsy, acute and chronic pain, including inflammatory and neuropathic pain, and recovery from spinal cord injury (“SCI”), which are conditions that affect millions of people but for which there are limited or poor treatment options. We are also considering developing treatment options for other conditions based on results of preclinical and clinical studies to date.
 
In order to facilitate our business activities and product development, the Company has implemented an internal restructuring plan based upon our two research platforms: pharmaceutical cannabinoids and neuromodulators. The business unit focused on pharmaceutical cannabinoids is referred to as ResolutionRx and the business unit focused on neuromodulators is referred to as EndeavourRx. It is anticipated that the Company will use, at least initially, its management personnel to provide management, operational and oversight services to these two business units.
 

(i) | ResolutionRx, our pharmaceutical cannabinoids platform is developing compounds that target the body’s endocannabinoid system, and in particular, the re-purposing of dronabinol, an endocannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptor agonist, for the treatment of OSA. Dronabinol is already approved by the FDA for other indications. 
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | EndeavourRx, our neuromodulators platform is made up of two programs: (a) our AMPAkines program, which is developing proprietary compounds that act as positive allosteric modulators (“PAMs”) of AMPA-type glutamate receptors to promote neuronal function and (b) our GABAkines program, which is developing proprietary compounds that act as PAMs of GABAA receptors, and which was recently established pursuant to our entry into a patent license agreement (the “UWMRF Patent License Agreement”) with the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Research Foundation, Inc., an affiliate of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (“UWMRF”), into a patent license agreement. 

 
Management intends to organize our ResolutionRx and EndeavourRx business units into two subsidiaries: (i) a ResolutionRx subsidiary, into which we would contribute our pharmaceutical cannabinoid platform and its related tangible and intangible assets and certain of its liabilities and (ii) an EndeavourRx subsidiary, into which we would contribute our neuromodulator platform, including both the AMPAkine and GABAkine programs and their related tangible and intangible assets and certain of their liabilities.
 
Management believes that there are advantages to separating these platforms formally into newly formed subsidiaries, including but not limited to optimizing their asset values through separate financing channels and making them more attractive for capital raising as well as for strategic transactions.
 
The Company is also engaged in business development efforts (licensing/sub-licensing, joint venture and other commercial structures) with a view to securing strategic partnerships that represent strategic and operational infrastructure additions, as well as cash and in-kind funding opportunities. These efforts have focused on, but have not been limited to, transacting with brand and generic pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies as well as companies with potentially useful formulation or manufacturing capabilities, significant subject matter expertise and financial resources. No assurance can be given that any transaction will come to fruition and that if it does, that the terms will be favourable to the Company.

Neurotransmission
 
RespireRx is developing drugs to modify neurotransmission and create advanced treatments for disorders with high unmet needs. Neurotransmission is the basic process in the brain by which specialized nerve cells called neurons communicate information with each other.

As illustrated in this figure, during neurotransmission, neurons release chemicals called neurotransmitters which attach to receptors, very specific protein structures residing on adjacent neurons. This enables neurons to communicate with one another by either increasing or decreasing the excitability of the neuron receiving the communication. For example, glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, while gamma-amino-butyric acid (“GABA”) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. Neurons also contain receptors for anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), the brain’s own natural cannabinoid (endocannabinoid) neurotransmitters.

ResolutionRx – Pharmaceutical Cannabinoids
 
Background
 
The term cannabinoid refers to pharmacologically active substances originally found within the cannabis plant that led to the discovery of the body’s own cannabinoids, termed endocannabinoids. Endocannabinoids are endogenous neurotransmitters located throughout the brain and peripheral nervous system that are used by certain nerve cells to convey information from cell to cell. The two major endocannabinoids that have been identified are anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), which are secreted and act upon CB1 and CB2 endocannabinoid receptors, thereby influencing a variety of physiological functions, including respiration, appetite, convulsions and potentially others.
 
Due to the liberalization of state laws regulating the use and sales of cannabis over the last 5 years, a major industry has grown around its commercialization. However, while cannabis use has been legalized in certain states, it still is not legal under federal statutes and regulations. The medical use of any pharmacological agent must be approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and, to date, the FDA has not recognized or approved the cannabis plant as medicine nor is it federally legal to sell products that contain cannabinoids as drugs or dietary supplements without its approval.

Worldwide clinical research efforts have established the cannabinoid class of compounds as bona fide pharmaceutical products, or “pharmaceutical cannabinoids,” which are being developed and commercialized according to FDA regulatory and industry guidelines. Scientific research and commercial development to date has focused primarily on two major cannabinoids, dronabinol and cannabidiol (“CBD”). This research and development effort began in 1985 when dronabinol, a directly acting agonist on CB1 and CB2 receptors, was approved by the FDA as Marinol® for the treatment of AIDS-related anorexia and later for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Marinol®, as well as generic dronabinol, is available in 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg capsules, with a maximum labelled dosage of 20 mg/day for the AIDS indication, or 15 mg/m2 per dose for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.
 
This regulatory breakthrough subsequently led to the 2018 FDA approval of Epidiolex®, a proprietary oral solution of CBD sold by GW Pharmaceuticals plc (“GW Pharma”) for the treatment of certain rare, treatment-resistant forms of epilepsy. Nabiximol®, an oromucosal spray containing Δ9-THC and CBD, was approved under the tradename Sativex® by applicable regulatory authorities in 29 countries outside the United States and is marketed and distributed by GW Pharmaceuticals plc (“GW”) (On May 5, 2021, GW and Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (“Jazz”) announced the completion of Jazz’s acquisition of GW).
 
The commercialization of these pharmaceutical cannabinoids has opened the door to an expanding market sector. As part of our effort to capitalize upon this opportunity, the Company has implemented an internal restructuring plan by forming ResolutionRx as a business unit focused on the pharmaceutical cannabinoid market. ResolutionRx’s initial primary focus has been and will continue to be the re-purposing of dronabinol using new proprietary formulations and therapeutic indications. Because dronabinol already is an approved drug, we intend to use publicly available information, particularly safety data, in support of a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (“NDA”), generally a more rapid route to FDA approval than a standard 505(b)(1) NDA.
 
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)
 
The Company is developing dronabinol for the treatment of OSA, a sleep-related breathing disorder that afflicts an estimated 29 million people in the United States according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (“AASM”), and an additional 26 million in Germany and 8 million in the United Kingdom, as presented at the European Respiratory Society’s annual Congress in Paris, France in September 2018. OSA involves a decrease or complete halt in airflow despite an ongoing effort to breathe during sleep. When the muscles relax during sleep, soft tissue in the back of the throat collapses and obstructs the upper airway. OSA remains significantly under-recognized, as only 20% of cases in the United States according to the AASM and 20% of cases globally have been properly diagnosed. About 24 percent of adult men and 9 percent of adult women are believed to have the breathing symptoms of OSA with or without daytime sleepiness. OSA significantly impacts the lives of sufferers who do not get enough sleep; their quality of sleep is deteriorated such that daily function is compromised and limited. OSA is associated with decreased quality of life, significant functional impairment, and increased risk of road traffic accidents, especially in professions like road and rail transportation and shipping.
 
Research has established links between OSA and several important co-morbidities, including hypertension, type II diabetes, obesity, stroke, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, and even early mortality. The consequences of undiagnosed and untreated OSA are medically serious and economically costly. According to the AASM, the estimated economic burden of OSA in the United States is approximately $162 billion annually. All current treatment options have serious drawbacks. We believe that a new drug therapy that is effective in reducing the medical and economic burden of OSA would have major benefits for the treatment of this costly disease indication.

Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (“CPAP”) is the most common treatment for OSA. CPAP devices work by blowing pressurized air into the nose (or mouth and nose), which keeps the pharyngeal airway open. Patients must use the device whenever they sleep. Reduction of the apnea-hypopnea index (“AHI”) is the standard objective measure of therapeutic response in OSA. Apnea is the cessation of breathing for 10 seconds or more and hypopnea is a reduction in breathing. AHI is the sum of apnea and hypopnea events per hour. In the sleep laboratory, CPAP is highly effective at reducing AHI. However, the device is cumbersome and difficult for many patients to tolerate. Most studies describe that 25-50% of patients refuse to initiate or completely discontinue CPAP use within the first several months and that most patients who continue to use the device do so only intermittently.
 
Oral devices may be an option for patients who cannot tolerate CPAP. Several dental devices are available. The cost of these devices tends to be high and side effects associated with them include night-time pain, dry lips, tooth discomfort, and excessive salivation.
 
Patients with clinically significant OSA who cannot be treated adequately with CPAP or oral devices may elect to undergo surgery, the most common form of which involves the removal of excess tissue in the throat to make the airway wider. Patients who undergo surgery for the treatment of OSA risk complications. Surgery is often unsuccessful, and at present, no method exists to reliably predict therapeutic outcome from surgery.
 
In 2014, another surgical option first became available based on upper airway stimulation. This was later followed by a second-generation medical device cleared by the FDA in 2017. It is a combination of an implantable nerve stimulator and an external remote controlled by the patient. The implanted device stimulates the hypoglossal nerve, which controls the tongue, with every attempted breath, regardless of whether such stimulation is needed for that breath. The device is turned on at night and off in the morning by the patient with the remote.
 
The Company’s Research Efforts Regarding the Treatment of OSA with Cannabinoids
 
The Company conducted a 21-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation Phase 2A clinical study in 22 patients with OSA, in which FDA approved and commercially available dronabinol produced a statistically significant reduction in AHI, the primary therapeutic end-point, and was observed to be safe and well tolerated, with the frequency of side effects no different from placebo. This clinical trial provided data supporting the submission of patent applications claiming unique dosage strengths, blood levels and controlled release formulations optimized for use in the treatment of OSA. If approved, these pending patents would extend market exclusivity until January 2042.
 
With approximately $5 million in funding from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), Dr. David Carley of the University of Illinois at Chicago (“UIC”), along with his colleagues at UIC and Northwestern University, completed a Phase 2B multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of FDA approved and commercially available dronabinol in patients with OSA. This study, named “Pharmacotherapy of Apnea with Cannabimimetic Enhancement” (“PACE”) replicated our earlier Phase 2A study. The authors published in the January 2018 issue of the journal SLEEP and reported that, in a dose-dependent fashion, treatment with 2.5 mg and 10 mg of dronabinol once per day at night significantly reduced, compared to placebo, AHI during sleep in 56 evaluable patients with moderate to severe OSA who completed the study. Additionally, treatment with 10 mg of dronabinol significantly improved daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and achieved the greatest overall patient satisfaction. As in our previous Phase 2A study, dronabinol was observed to be safe and well tolerated, with the frequency of side effects no different from placebo. The Company did not manage this clinical trial, which was funded entirely by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of NIH.
 
The Opportunity to Improve Dronabinol Formulations
 
A major factor limiting the use of dronabinol for other indications stems from its current formulation as a soft gelatin capsule that suffers from several major deficiencies.

7
-

 

First, dronabinol is not water soluble and exhibits poor and erratic absorption. The market-dominant commercial gel cap formulation of dronabinol is currently formulated as a sesame oil-based liquid within a soft gelatin capsule. The absorption of dronabinol after oral administration is poor and highly variable with some patients achieving very high levels and others achieving very low levels. This erratic absorption may be responsible for the variable therapeutic responses observed in dronabinol clinical trials. Syndros®, on the other hand, is formulated as a dronabinol solution in dehydrated alcohol, polyethylene glycol and other materials and exhibits its own challenges and deficiencies, including but not limited to it being classified as a Schedule II drug by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) as compared to the capsule formulation that is classified as a Schedule III drug. Syndros® is no longer being marketed.
 
Second, dronabinol is rapidly and extensively (approximately 80%) metabolized upon first pass through the liver, resulting in low blood levels. Additionally, dronabinol has a relatively short half-life (approximately 3 – 4 hours) and, in its present formulation, is not optimally suited for therapeutic indications requiring controlled and sustained blood levels.
 
Third, in order to achieve sustained, therapeutic blood levels, we have found it necessary to use higher doses of dronabinol in our OSA clinical trials. For example, over an 8-hour period, the 2.5 mg and 10 mg doses produced therapeutically equivalent effects during the first 4 hours, but only the 10 mg dose produced therapeutic effects during the second 4 hours. Unfortunately, the 10 mg dose can produce a higher occurrence of side effects than the 2.5 mg dose (as described in the Marinol® package insert). We are currently developing new formulations that would achieve the blood levels produced by the lower doses for a sustained time period, resulting in the desired therapeutic effect(s) while minimizing undesirable side effects.
 
In order to circumvent these problems, we have designated certain important properties around which we have created a number of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations of dronabinol, three (3) of which (i) display appropriate water solubility and dissolution to improve absorption, (ii) nano-particle size and resistance to stomach acid conditions in order to reduce first pass liver metabolism and achieve higher and longer blood levels, as well as (iii) stability and ease of manufacturing to support commercial scale. Pending additional financing (availability of which cannot be assured), we plan to test these formulations in animal and human pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies. We believe that the development of a novel, proprietary formulation of dronabinol would not require significantly longer time to market entry compared to what would be required if we were to use the currently available soft gel capsule technology.
 
The Company’s Cannabinoid Intellectual Property Rights
 
In order to expand RespireRx’s respiratory disorders program and develop cannabinoids for the treatment of OSA, RespireRx acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Pier Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Pier”) effective August 10, 2012 pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger. Pier was a clinical stage pharmaceutical company developing a pharmacologic treatment for OSA and had been engaged in research and clinical development activities.
 
On June 27, 2014, RespireRx entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “2014 License Agreement”) with the University of Illinois at Chicago (“UIC”) that replaced a 2007 license agreement with Pier that had been terminated. The 2014 License Agreement grants the Company, among other provisions, exclusive rights: (i) to practice certain patents in the United States, and certain other countries as set forth in the 2014 License Agreement; (ii) to identify, develop, make, have made, import, export, lease, sell, have sold or offer for sale any related licensed products; and (iii) to grant sub-licenses of the rights granted in the 2014 License Agreement, subject to the provisions of the 2014 License Agreement. The 2014 License Agreement obligates the Company to pay UIC a license fee, royalties, patent costs and certain milestones. Royalty payments include a royalty on net sales of 4%, payment on sub-licensee revenues of 12.5%, and a minimum annual royalty beginning in 2015 of $100,000, which is due and payable on December 31 of each year beginning on December 31, 2015. The due date of the minimum annual royalty obligation of $100,000 originally due on December 31, 2021, was extended to April 30, 2022. A one-time milestone payment will be due within 5 days of any of the following, (a) dosing of the first patient with a dronabinol product in a Phase 2 human clinical study anywhere in the world that is not sponsored by the University of Illinois, (b) dosing of the first patient in a Phase 2 human clinical study anywhere in the world with a low dose dronabinol (defined as less than or equal to 1 mg), or (c) dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1 human clinical study anywhere in the world with a proprietary reformulation of dronabinol. One-time milestone payments may become due based upon the achievement of certain development milestones. $350,000 will be due within five days after the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 human clinical trial anywhere in the world. $500,000 will be due within five days after the first NDA filing with the FDA, as defined below, or a foreign equivalent. $1,000,000 will be due within twelve months of the first commercial sale. One-time and annual royalty payments may also become due and payable. In the year after the first application for market approval is submitted to the FDA or a foreign equivalent and until approval is obtained, the minimum annual royalty will increase to $150,000. In the year after the first market approval is obtained from the FDA or a foreign equivalent and until the first sale of a product, the minimum annual royalty will increase to $200,000. In the year after the first commercial sale of a product, the minimum annual royalty will increase to $250,000. For each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded a charge to operations of $100,000 as its minimum annual royalty obligation, which is included in research and development expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

RespireRx has exclusive rights to issued and pending patents claiming cannabinoid compositions and methods for treating cannabinoid-sensitive disorders, including sleep apnea, pain, glaucoma, muscular spasticity, anorexia and other conditions. In January 2021, we filed a provisional patent application further disclosing novel dosages, controlled release compositions and methods of use for cannabinoids, and in January 2021, a provisional patent application further disclosing novel dosage and controlled release compositions and methods of use for cannabinoids, alone or in combination, including with cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid molecules. Specific claims describe low dosage strengths and controlled release formulations for attaining a therapeutic window of cannabinoid blood levels that produce the desired therapeutic effect(s) for a controlled period of time, while minimizing undesirable side effects. In January 2022, we filed a provisional patent application describing novel lipid based formulation technology (LFT) that may be used to improve the solubility and bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs, particularly cannabinoids such as dronabinol. Certain original patents were filed by RespireRx and are now included in the 2014 License Agreement. See Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies—University of Illinois 2014 Exclusive License Agreement in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021. While no assurances can be provided that the claims in our patent applications will be allowed in whole or in part, or that the patents will ultimately issue, we believe that these new filings, if allowed, will provide market protections through January 2042.
 
Data from our Phase 2 clinical trials has allowed us to design new proprietary formulations of dronabinol, disclosed in our patent filings and optimized for the treatment of not only OSA, but also other indications. If successful in our development efforts, we believe that a proprietary formulation of dronabinol, based on our recently filed provisional patent applications for LFT and pending patents for low-dose and extended release dronabinol, could lead to a highly marketable commercial formulation of dronabinol for use not only in the treatment of OSA but other indications, as well. We also believe that such novel, proprietary formulations of dronabinol would extend market exclusivity, increase market value and be more interesting to certain potential strategic partners.
 
Proposed Regulatory Approach for Dronabinol
 
In conjunction with its management and consultants, the Company intends to file a new NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (as amended, the “FDCA” and such NDA a “505(b)(2) NDA”), claiming the efficacy and safety of our proposed proprietary dronabinol formulation in the treatment of OSA. We believe the use of dronabinol for the treatment of OSA is a novel indication for an already approved drug, making it eligible for a 505(b)(2) NDA, as opposed to the submission and approval of a full 505(b)(1) NDA.
 
The 505(b)(2) NDA was created by the Hatch-Waxman Act, as amended (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”), which amended the FDCA to help avoid unnecessary duplication of studies already performed on a previously approved drug. As amended, the FDCA gives the FDA express permission to rely on data not developed by the NDA applicant. Accordingly, a 505(b)(2) NDA must contain full safety and effectiveness reports but allows at least some of the information required for NDA approval, such as safety and efficacy information about the active ingredient, to come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. This can result in a less expensive and faster route to approval, compared with a traditional development path, such as 505(b)(1), while still allowing for the creation of new, differentiated products. The 505(b)(2) NDA regulatory path offers the applicant market protections, such as market exclusivity, under the Hatch-Waxman Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. Other, international regulatory routes are available to pursue proprietary formulations of dronabinol and would provide further market protections. For example, in Europe, a regulatory approval route similar to the 505(b)(2) pathway is the hybrid procedure based on Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC.
 
We have worked with regulatory consultants who will assist with FDA filings and regulatory strategy. If we can secure sufficient financing, of which no assurance can be provided, we anticipate requesting a pre-Investigational New Drug application (“pre-IND”) meeting with the FDA. This meeting also could create the type of dialogue with the FDA that is normally communicated at an end-of-Phase 2 meeting. The FDA responses to this meeting will be incorporated into an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”).
 
If we can secure sufficient financing and successfully create a proprietary formulation of dronabinol, of which no assurance can be provided, we plan to propose conducting the appropriate clinical studies with our proprietary controlled release formulation in OSA patients to determine safety, PK and efficacy, as well as a standard Phase 1 clinical study to determine potential abuse liability. When a Phase 3 study is required for a 505(b)(2), usually only one study with fewer patients is necessary versus the two, large scale, confirmatory studies generally required for the standard 505(b)(1) NDA. While no assurance can be provided, with an extensive safety database tracking chronic, long-term use of Marinol® and generics, we believe that the FDA should not have major safety concerns with dronabinol in the treatment of OSA.

The Company has worked with the investigators who conducted the Phase 2B clinical trial and our Clinical Advisory Panel to design a draft Phase 3 protocol summary that, based on the experience and results from the Phase 2A and Phase 2B trials, we believe will provide sufficient data for FDA approval of a RespireRx dronabinol controlled release formulation for OSA. The current version of the protocol is designed as a 90-day randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study of dronabinol in the treatment of OSA. Depending on feedback from the FDA, the Company estimates that the Phase 3 trial would require between 120 and 300 patients at 15 to 20 sites, and take 18 to 24 months to complete, at a cost of between $10 million and $14 million.
 
We believe our rights under the Purisys Agreement would help facilitate regulatory approval. Under the Purisys Agreement, Purisys has agreed, at no cost to us, to (i) provide all of the API estimated to be needed for the clinical development process for first- and second-generation products, three validation batches for NDA filings and adequate supply for the initial inventory stocking for the wholesale and retail channels, subject to certain limitations, (ii) maintain or file valid DMFs with the FDA or any other regulatory authority and provide the Company with access or a right of reference letter entitling the Company to make continuing reference to the DMFs during the term of the agreement in connection with any regulatory filings made with the FDA by the Company, (iii) participate on a development committee, and (iv) make available its regulatory consultants, collaborate with any regulatory consulting firms engaged by the Company and participate in all FDA or DEA meetings as appropriate and as related to the API.
 
In consideration for these supplies and services, the Company has agreed to (i) purchase exclusively from Purisys, during the commercialization phase, all API for these products at a pre-determined price subject to certain producer price adjustments and (ii) allow Purisys’s participation in the economic success of the commercialized products up to the earlier of the achievement of a maximum dollar amount or the expiration of a period of time.
 
Large Commercial Opportunity
 
As a serious public health issue, the important need for diagnosing and ultimately treating OSA has recently been highlighted by the FDA clearance of several sleep apnea home test kits that are now third party reimbursed. Further highlighting this need, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE: CVS) announced the implementation of a program to diagnose and treat OSA initially within its own in-store, walk-in MinuteClinics. If implemented throughout its HealthHUB store network, we expect the number of people diagnosed with sleep apnea and eligible for treatment to increase dramatically. Fitbit, Inc., (NYSE: FIT), a health oriented smart watch company is seeking clearance from the FDA to diagnose sleep apnea using its smart watches. We believe that the combination of more efficient and patient friendly diagnostic procedures and, ultimately, pharmaceutical treatments such as those we are developing will encourage more patients to seek diagnosis and treatment. As noted above, there are approximately 29 million OSA patients in the United States and an additional 26 million in Germany and 8 million in the United Kingdom. There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of OSA.
 
EndeavourRx – Neuromodulators
 
Background
 
As described above, during the neurotransmission process, neurons release neurotransmitters that attach to specific receptors residing on adjacent neurons, enabling them to communicate with one another and produce excitatory or inhibitory effects. For example, glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. While the neurotransmitter attachment site on each of these receptors does not change, the receptor protein subunit structures can vary so that the receptors can produce a variety of effects. With the AMPA glutamate receptor, the binding of glutamate or an artificial agonist to its attachment site causes a change in the structure of the AMPA receptor resulting in an influx of cations and an increased excitability. Likewise, in the case of the GABAA receptor, the binding of GABA or an artificial agonist to its attachment site causes a change in the structure of the GABAA receptor ion channel and increases the flow of chloride ions (negatively charged anion) into the cell, resulting in decreased excitability.

Neurotransmitter receptor proteins also may contain auxiliary “allosteric” binding sites, which are located adjacent to the agonist binding sites at which neurotransmitters act. Unlike neurotransmitters, neuromodulators are drugs that act at these allosteric binding sites rather than directly at the agonist binding site. They can act either as PAMs, which enhance, or as negative allosteric modulators (“NAMs”), which reduce, the actions of neurotransmitters at their primary receptor sites. Neuromodulators have no intrinsic activity of their own. We have coined the terms “AMPAkines” and “GABAkines” to refer to drugs that act as PAMs at the AMPA and GABAA receptors, respectively. By enhancing the effects of neurotransmitters without altering the normal pattern of neuronal activity, neuromodulators offer the possibility of developing “kinder and gentler” neuropharmacological drugs effective in certain neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, with greater pharmacological specificity and reduced side effects.
 
Proposed Regulatory Approach for AMPAkines and GABAkines
 
In conjunction with its management and consultants, the Company intends to initially perform appropriate and required preclinical studies with its GABAkines and file INDs to commence clinical trials with one or more of those drug candidates and either amend existing INDs or file new INDs for its AMPAkines in order to conduct additional clinical trials with those drug candidates. If such studies safely show statistically significant improvement in appropriate clinical endpoints they would likely result in the filing of one or more NDAs for the AMPAkine(s) under Section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act as amended, the traditional regulatory path for new chemical entities (NCEs). The NDAs for the GABAkine drug product candidates, also would be filed as 505(b)(1) NDAs.
 
As part of our effort to capitalize upon a possible market opportunity with respect to neuromodulators, the Company has implemented an internal restructuring plan, by which EndeavourRx became a stand-alone business unit focused on the neuromodulator market. EndeavourRx comprises our AMPAkine program and our GABAkine program.
 
AMPAkines
 
The Company is developing a class of proprietary compounds known as AMPAkines, which are PAMs of the AMPA glutamate receptor. AMPAkines are small molecule compounds that enhance the excitatory actions of glutamate at the AMPA receptor complex, which mediates most excitatory transmission in the central nervous system (“CNS”). Through an extensive translational research effort from the cellular level through Phase 2 clinical trials, we have developed a family of AMPAkines, including CX717, CX1739 and CX1942 that may have clinical application in the treatment of CNS-driven neurobehavioral and cognitive disorders, spinal cord injury (“SCI”), neurological diseases, and certain orphan indications. CX717 and CX1739, our lead clinical compounds, have successfully completed multiple Phase 1 safety trials with no drug-associated serious adverse events. Both compounds have also completed Phase 2 efficacy trials demonstrating target engagement, by antagonizing the process of opioid-induced respiratory depression (“OIRD”). CX717 has successfully completed a Phase 2 trial demonstrating the ability to significantly reduce the symptoms of adult ADHD. In an early Phase 2 study, CX1739 improved breathing in patients with central sleep apnea. In addition, preclinical studies have highlighted the potential ability of these AMPAkines to improve motor function in animals with SCI. Subject to raising sufficient financing (of which no assurance can be provided), we believe that we will be able to initiate a human Phase 2 study with CX1739 in patients with SCI and a human Phase 2 study in patients with ADHD using either CX1739 or CX717.
 
AMPAkines as Treatment for ADHD
 
ADHD is a relatively common neurobehavioral disorder. Currently available treatments for ADHD include amphetamine-type stimulants and non-stimulant agents targeting monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems in the brain. However, these neurotransmitter systems are not restricted to the brain and are widely found throughout the body. Thus, while these agents can be effective in ameliorating ADHD symptoms, they also can produce adverse cardiovascular effects, such as increased heart rate and blood pressure. Existing treatments also affect eating habits and can reduce weight gain and growth in children and have been associated with suicidal ideation in adolescents and adults. In addition, approved stimulant treatments are DEA classified as controlled substances and present logistical issues for distribution and protection from diversion. Approved non-stimulant treatments, such as atomoxetine (Strattera® and its generic equivalents), can take four to eight weeks to become effective and undesirable side effects also have been observed.

Various investigators have generated data supporting the concept that alterations in AMPA receptor function might underlie the production of some of the symptoms of ADHD. In rodent and primate models of cognition, AMPAkines have been demonstrated to reduce inattention and impulsivity, two of the cardinal symptoms of ADHD. Furthermore, AMPAkines do not stimulate spontaneous locomotor activity in either mice or rats, unlike the stimulants presently used for the treatment of ADHD, nor do they increase the stimulation produced by amphetamine or cocaine. These preclinical considerations prompted us to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two period crossover study to assess the efficacy and safety of CX717 in adults with ADHD.
 
In a repeated measures analysis, a statistically significant treatment effect on the ADHD Rating Scale (“ADHD-RS”), the primary outcome measure, was observed after a three-week administration of CX717, at a dose of 800 mg BID. Differences between this dose of CX717 and placebo were observed as early as week one of treatment and continued throughout the remainder of the study. The low dose of CX717, 200 mg BID, did not differ from placebo. In general, results from both the ADHD-RS hyperactivity and inattentiveness subscales, which were secondary efficacy variables, paralleled the results of the total score. CX717 was considered safe and well tolerated.
 
Based on these clinical results, we believe that AMPAkines such as CX717 or CX1739 might represent a breakthrough opportunity to develop a non-stimulating therapeutic for ADHD with the rapidity of onset normally seen with stimulants. Subject to raising sufficient financing (of which no assurance can be provided), we are planning to continue this program with a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with adult ADHD using one of our two lead ampakine compounds.
 
AMPAkines as Treatment for SCI
 
AMPAkines also may have potential utility in the treatment and management of SCI to enhance motor functions and improve the quality of life for SCI patients. An estimated 17,000 new cases of SCI occur each year in the United States, most a result of automobile accidents. Currently, there are roughly 282,000 people living in the United States with spinal cord injuries, which often produce impaired motor function.
 
SCI can profoundly impair neural plasticity leading to significant morbidity and mortality in human accident victims. Plasticity is a fundamental property of the nervous system that enables continuous alteration of neural pathways and synapses in response to experience or injury. A large body of literature exists regarding the ability of AMPAkines to stimulate neural plasticity, possibly due to an enhanced synthesis and secretion of various growth factors.
 
We have been working with Dr. David Fuller at the University of Florida, a long-time collaborator who has funding from NIH, to evaluate the use of AMPAkines CX1739 and CX717 for the treatment of compromised motor function in models of SCI. Using rodents that have received spinal hemi-sections, the AMPAkines were observed to increase motor nerve activity bilaterally. The effect on the hemisected side was greater than that measured on the intact side, with the recovery approximating that seen on the intact side prior to administration of ampakine. The doses of AMPAkines active in SCI were comparable to those demonstrating antagonism of OIRD, indicating target engagement of the AMPA receptors.
 
A recently published paper by Dr Fuller entitled “Ampakines stimulate diaphragm activity after spinal cord injury” (http://doi.org/10.1089/neu.2021.0301 ) describes research conducted for the first time in awake freely moving rats as late as two weeks after having previously undergone unilateral spinal hemi-transection at the C2 spinal level. For the first time, low dose administration of either CX1739 or CX717 was shown to improve not only motor nerve and muscle activity recorded electrophysiologically from the lesioned side, but to significantly improve actual motor functioning and breathing, even under challenging conditions. The importance of these findings is described in the article by pointing out that the majority of the approximately 500,000 annual SCI cases reported globally involve injuries to the cervical spinal cord and, in severe cases, require the use of mechanical ventilation or direct diaphragm pacing to sustain ventilation. Also, in confirmation of previously reported results in anesthetized animals, the AMPAkines improved, in awake freely moving animals, the motor facilitation produced by an episode of acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH), a treatment currently used in the rehabilitation of SCI patients.

Recently, studies in patients with SCI have demonstrated that neural plasticity can be induced to improve motor function. This is based on the ability of spinal circuitry to learn how to adjust spinal and brainstem synaptic strength following repeated hypoxic bouts. Animal studies have demonstrated the ability of AMPAkines to dramatically enhance the effects of AIH on motor neuron activity after SCI. Because AMPAkines are known to enhance synaptic plasticity, the potential exists to harness repetitive AIH in combination with AMPAkines as a means of inducing functional recovery of motor function following SCI.
 
These animal models of motor nerve function following SCI support proof of concept for a new treatment paradigm using AMPAkines to improve motor functions in patients with SCI. With additional funding granted by NIH to Dr. Fuller, the Company is continuing its collaborative preclinical research with him, while it is planning a clinical trial program focused on developing AMPAkines for the restoration of certain motor functions in patients with SCI. The Company is working with researchers at highly regarded clinical sites to finalize a Phase 2 clinical trial protocol. We believe that a clinical study could be initiated within several months of raising sufficient financing (of which no assurance can be provided).
 
GABAkines
 
The GABAkine program was established pursuant to the UWMRF Patent License Agreement. At present, the program is focused on developing novel GABAkines with certain GABAA receptor subtype selectivity. We believe that there is a considerable degree of receptor subtype heterogeneity, making subtype selectivity of our compounds a desirable attribute.
 
On August 1, 2020, RespireRx exercised its option pursuant to its option agreement dated March 2, 2020, between RespireRx and UWMRF. Upon exercise RespireRx and UWMRF executed the UWMRF Patent License Agreement effective August 1, 2020 (the “Effective Date”) pursuant to which RespireRx licensed the identified intellectual property. Under the UWMRF Patent License Agreement, the Company has an exclusive license to commercialize GABAkine products based on UWMRF’s rights in certain patents and patent applications, and a non-exclusive license to commercialize products based on UWMRF’s rights in certain technology that is not the subject of the patents or patent applications. UWMRF maintains the right to use, and, upon the approval of the Company, to license, these patent and technology rights for any non-commercial purpose, including research and education. The UWMRF Patent License Agreement expires upon the later of the expiration of the Company’s payment obligations to UWMRF or the expiration of the last remaining licensed patent granted thereunder, subject to early termination upon the occurrence of certain events. The License Agreement also contains a standard indemnification provision in favor of UWMRF and confidentiality provisions obligating both parties. Under the UWMRF Patent License Agreement, in consideration for the licenses granted, the Company will pay to UWMRF the following: (i) patent filing and prosecution costs incurred by UWMRF prior to the Effective Date, paid in yearly installments over three years from the Effective Date; (ii) annual maintenance fees, beginning on the second anniversary of the Effective Date, ranging from $5,000 on the second anniversary to $15,000 on the fifth anniversary and each anniversary thereafter, which annual maintenance fees terminate upon the Company’s payment of royalties pursuant to clause (iv) below; (iii) milestone payments, paid upon the occurrence of certain dosing events of patients during clinical trials and certain approvals by the FDA, such milestone payments not to exceed $2,150,000 in the aggregate; and (iv) royalties on net sales of products developed with the licenses, subject to minimum annual payments and to royalty rate adjustments based on whether separate royalty payments by the Company yield an aggregate rate beyond a stated threshold. The Company has also granted UWMRF certain stock appreciation rights with respect to the Company’s neuromodulator programs, subject to certain limitations, and will pay to UWMRF certain percentages of revenues generated from sublicenses of the licenses provided under the License Agreement by the Company to third parties.
 
Benzodiazepines (“BDZs”), such as Valium® (diazepam), Librium® (chlordiazepoxide) and Xanax® (alprazolam) were the first major class of drugs reported to act as GABAA PAMs, by binding at a site distinct from the binding site for GABA. These drugs produce a wide range of pharmacological properties, including anxiety reduction, sedation, hypnosis, anti-convulsant, muscle relaxation, respiratory depression, cognitive impairment, as well as tolerance, abuse and withdrawal. For this reason, it was not surprising that BDZs were observed to act as GABAA PAMs indiscriminately across all GABAA receptor subtypes. Following the identification of BDZ binding sites on GABAA receptors, Dr. Arnold Lippa, our Interim President, Interim Chief Executive Officer, Chief Scientific Officer and Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors, described CL218,872, the first non-BDZ to demonstrate that these receptors were heterogeneous by binding selectively to a subtype of GABAA receptor. This demonstration of receptor heterogeneity led to the hypothesis that the various pharmacological actions of the BDZs might be separable depending on the receptor subtype involved. In animal testing, CL218,872 provided the proof of principle that such a separation could be achieved by displaying anti-anxiety and anti-convulsant properties in the absence of sedation, amnesia and muscular incoordination. Using ocinaplon, an analog of CL218,872 with similar receptor subtype selectivity, Dr. Lippa’s team reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science the results of a Phase 2 clinical trial in anxious patients that ocinaplon significantly reduced symptoms of anxiety in the absence of sedation. These findings gave impetus to the search for novel therapeutic drugs for neurological and psychiatric illnesses that display improvements in efficacy and reductions in side effects.

Over the last several years, a group of scientists led by Dr. James Cook of the University of Wisconsin and Dr. Jeffrey Witkin affiliated with the Indiana University School of Medicine, both of whom have been engaged as Senior Research Fellows at RespireRx, synthesized and tested a broad series of novel drugs that display GABAA receptor subtype selectivity and pharmacological specificity. Certain of these chemical compounds are the subject of the UWMRF Patent License Agreement.
 
Of these compounds, we have identified KRM-II-81 as a clinical lead. KRM-II-81 is the most advanced and druggable of a series of compounds that display certain receptor subtype selectivity and pharmacological specificity. In studies using cell cultures, brain tissues and whole animals, KRM-II-81 acts as a GABAA PAM at selective GABAA receptor subtypes that we feel are intimately involved in neuronal processes underlying epilepsy, pain, anxiety and certain other indications. KRM-II-81 has demonstrated highly desirable properties in animal models of these and other potential therapeutic indications, in the absence of or with greatly reduced liability to produce sedation, motor incoordination, cognitive impairments, respiratory depression, tolerance, abuse and withdrawal seizures, all side effects associated with BDZs. We currently are focused on the potential treatment of epilepsy and pain. Several articles describing the results of these studies have been published in highly regarded peer reviewed journals, including two review articles and a book chapter detailing the anti-epileptic and analgesic properties of KRM II-81 and its importance in the overall field of GABAkines.
 
Epilepsy and Existing Treatments
 
Epilepsy is a chronic and highly prevalent neurological disorder that affects millions of people world-wide and has serious consequences for the life of the affected individual. A first-line approach to the control of epilepsy is through the administration of anticonvulsant drugs. Repeated, uncontrolled seizures due to drug resistance and the side effects arising from seizure medications have a negative effect on the developing brain and can lead to brain cell loss and severe impairment of neurocognitive function. The continued occurrence of seizure activity also increases the probability of subsequent epileptic events through sensitization mechanisms called seizure kindling. Seizures that are unresponsive to anti-epileptic treatments are life-disrupting and life-threatening with broad health, life, and economic consequences.
 
Like many diseases, epilepsy is still remarkably underserved by currently available medicines. Pharmaco-resistance to anticonvulsant therapy continues to be one of the key obstacles to the treatment of epilepsy. Although many anticonvulsant drugs are approved to decrease seizure probability, seizures frequently are not fully controlled and patients are generally maintained daily on multiple antiepileptic drugs with the hope of enhancing the probability of seizure control. Despite this polypharmacy approach, as many as 60% to 70% of patients continue to have seizures. As a result of the lack of seizure control, pharmaco-resistant epilepsy patients, including young children, sometimes require and elect to have invasive therapeutic procedures such as surgical resection of targeted brain tissue.
 
Despite the availability of a host of marketed drugs of different mechanistic classes, the lack of seizure control in patients is the primary factor driving the need for improved antiepileptic drugs, as emphasized by researchers and patient advocacy communities. Increasing inhibitory tone in the CNS through enhancement of GABAergic inhibition is a proven mechanism for seizure control. However, GABAergic medications also exhibit liabilities that limit their antiepileptic potential. Tolerance develops to GABAergic drugs such as BDZs, limiting their use in a chronic setting. These drugs can produce cognitive impairment, somnolence, sedation, tolerance and withdrawal seizures that create dosing limitations such that they are generally used only for acute convulsive episodes.
 
GABAkines as Treatments for Epilepsy
 
KRM-II-81 has demonstrated efficacy in multiple rodent models and measures of antiepileptic drug efficacy in vivo. This includes nine acute seizure provocation models in mice and rats, four seizure sensitization models in rats and mice, two models of chronic epilepsy, and three models specifically testing pharmaco-resistant antiepileptic drug efficacy. Because it appears to have a substantially reduced side effect liability, it might be possible to use higher, more effective doses than standard of care medications. Predictions of superior efficacy of KRM-II-81 over standard of care anti-epileptics comes from the efficacy of this compound across a broad range of animal models of epilepsy. Importantly, KRM-II-81 has been shown to be effective in models assessing pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. Under these conditions, KRM-II-81 is efficacious in cases where standard of care medicines do not work.

In the absence of seizure control by anti-epileptics, surgical resection of affected brain tissue is one potential alternative to help with the control of seizures. In the process of this surgery, epileptic brain tissue can become available for research into epileptic mechanisms and the identification of novel antiepileptic drugs. In recent articles by Dr. Witkin and his colleagues, the anticonvulsant action of KRM-II-81 has been confirmed by microelectrode recordings from slices obtained from freshly excised cortex tissue from epileptic patients where in situ application of KRM-II-81 suppressed epileptiform electrical activity. These very important translational data lend considerable support and impetus to the further development of KRM-II-81 for the treatment of epilepsy.
 
GABAkines as Treatments for Pain
 
It is impossible not to be aware of the crisis that the opioid epidemic has created in the treatment of pain. While there is no question as to their efficacy, the clinical use of opioids is severely limited due to the rapid development of tolerance, dependence and the production of OIRD, the major cause of opioid-induced lethality. Research programs are underway nationwide to discover and develop new non-opioid drugs that are effective analgesics without the tolerance and abuse liability ascribed to opioids. Pain is especially difficult to treat due to its complex nature with a variety of different etiologies. For example, chronic pain may be produced by injury, surgery, neuropathy, the inflammation produced by arthritis or by certain drugs such as cancer chemotherapeutics. For these reasons, better management and control of chronic pain continues to be a serious need in medical practice.
 
Data from both preclinical and clinical studies are consistent with the idea that GABAergic neurotransmission is an important regulatory mechanism for the control of pain. Gabapentin (Neurontin®) and pregabalin (Lyrica®), two commonly used drugs for the treatment of neuropathic pain, are believed to produce their analgesic effects by enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission. However, although they have received FDA approval, the clinical results have not been overwhelming. In a published review of 37 clinical trials with a total of 5,914 patients experiencing neuropathic pain there was no difference in the percentage of patients experiencing pain reduction of greater than 50% when comparing gabapentin to placebo. The most common side effects produced by gabapentin were sedation, dizziness and problems walking. It is uncertain whether greater efficacy was not observed because of poor intrinsic pharmacological efficacy or insufficient dosages due to dose limiting side effects.
 
An alternate approach to enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission is the use of GABAA PAMs. This approach has been under-utilized because of the general lack of efficacy of the BDZ PAMs. However, a strong case for the potential value of subtype selective GABAA PAMs for the treatment of pain can be made. First, GABAA receptor regulated pathways are integral to pain processing with α2/3 containing GABAA receptor subtypes present on nerve pathways modulating pain sensation and perception. Second, we believe that the analgesic properties of BDZs may be masked by concurrent activation of other GABAA receptor subtypes that mediate the side effects. Diazepam has been reported to produce maximal analgesia in rodents if the side effects are attenuated by GABAA subtype genetic manipulation. Third, in recently published review articles describing KRM-II-81 and predecessor GABAkines that selectively amplify GABAA receptor subtype signaling, Drs. Witkin, Cook and colleagues reported that these GABAkines displayed a high degree of analgesic activity in a broad range of preclinical studies. In cellular studies, KRM-II-81 preferentially bound to specific subtypes of GABAA receptors and boosted the ability of GABA to inhibit pain sensory neurons in the spinal dorsal root ganglia. In intact animal models of acute and chronic pain, the analgesic efficacy of KRM-II-81 was comparable to or greater than commonly used analgesics. At the same time, KRM-II-81 did not display side effects such sedation and motor impairment.
 
Equally important, KRM-II-81 did not produce tolerance, dependence, respiratory depression or behavioral changes indicative of abuse liability, which are produced by opioid narcotics and are at the heart of the opioid epidemic. Sub-chronic dosing for 22 days with KRM-II-81 and the structural analogue, MP-III-80, demonstrated enduring analgesic efficacy without tolerance development. In contrast, tolerance developed to the analgesic effects of gabapentin. At a dose that produces maximal analgesic effect in an inflammatory chronic pain model, KRM-II-81 does not substitute for the BDZ midazolam in a drug discrimination assay, suggesting a reduced abuse liability. Furthermore, KRM-II-81 did not produce the respiratory depression observed with alprazolam, a major problem with BDZs leading to emergency room visits and overdose. We believe that the ability to attenuate both acute and chronic pain combined with a greatly reduced side effect profile, a lack of tolerance and a reduced abuse potential makes KRM-II-81 a promising clinical lead and a potentially breakthrough advance in pain therapeutics.

Drs. Witkin and Cerne have begun conducting pharmacology, metabolism, pharmacokinetic and safety studies to be included in future FDA filings. Dr. Cook has begun scaling up chemical synthesis of KRM II-81 in order to provide sufficient active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to begin IND enabling preclinical studies, which we plan to initiate this year pending financing. In addition, substituted analogues of KRM II-81 have been made, particularly a soluble analogue that displays a similar pharmacological profile as KRM II-81. Several articles describing the results of these studies have been published in highly regarded peer reviewed journals, including two review articles and a book chapter detailing the anti-epileptic and analgesic properties of KRM II-81 and its importance in the overall field of GABAkines.
 
Corporate and Product Development Plans
 
As discussed above, in order to facilitate our business activities and product development, we have organized our drug platforms into two separate business units which currently operate as divisions, but which are anticipated to be re-organized as separate legal entity subsidiaries in the future. ResolutionRx is focused on pharmaceutical cannabinoids and EndeavourRx is focused on neuromodulators. Below is a description of the Company’s product development plans within these business units.
 
ResolutionRx – Dronabinol program
 
In conjunction with a sub-contractor, the Company has prepared several new proprietary formulations of dronabinol with the anticipated properties described in our patent applications, of which three have been selected for further testing animal pharmacokinetic (“PK”) and pharmacodynamic (“PD”) studies. Assuming sufficient additional financing is available, of which no assurance can be provided, and that the results of the animal testing indicate that further development is warranted, we intend to engage regulatory consultants, stock clinical supply, package and distribution the clinical supply to clinical trial sites, schedule a pre-investigational new drug application (“pre-IND”) meeting with the FDA, file an IND and then conduct Phase 2 PK and PD human clinical trials and ultimately one or more pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies.


If the ResolutionRx business unit is incorporated, the Purisys Agreement and the 2014 License Agreement will need to be transferred or otherwise made available to ResolutionRx. See “—Noramco Inc./Purisys, LLC - Dronabinol Development and Supply Agreement” and “—University of Illinois 2014 Exclusive License Agreement” in Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021. Initially, ResolutionRx’s primary focus will be on re-purposing dronabinol for the treatment of OSA; we believe that our broad enabling patents and our 2019, 2021 and 2022 patent applications for proprietary formulation technology may provide a framework for expanding into the larger burgeoning pharmaceutical cannabinoid industry. We believe that by converting this division to a subsidiary, it may be possible, through separate finance channels and potential strategic transactions, to unlock the unrealized asset value not only of the cannabinoid platform, but separately, our neuromodulator platform as well.


EndeavourRx – AMPAkines program
 
For the AMPAkines program within our EndeavourRx neuromodulators business unit, the Company plans, assuming financing is available, of which no assurance can be provided, to assess the purity of our existing drug supplies, obtain clinical supply material, engage regulatory consultants and a contract research organization (CRO) to finalize a clinical trial protocol and conduct a Phase 2A clinical trial to determine the safety, PK and PD properties of CX1739, one of our lead AMPAkines in patients who have had SCI. These tasks are critical for applying to the FDA for permission to amend our existing IND or initiate a new IND enabling the commencement of clinical trials.


Assuming sufficient additional financing is available, of which no assurance can be provided, the Company would continue to focus on SCI, and in particular, a Phase 2A efficacy study, as we believe it would be the most efficient expenditure of our resources, yield an actionable result in the shortest period of time and would initiate additional clinical trials in patients with ADHD.
 
EndeavourRx – GABAkines program
 
For the GABAkines program, the Company plans, assuming such financing is available, of which no assurance can be provided, to obtain active pharmaceutical ingredient of KRM-II-81 and/or one or more of its analogs or derivative and have them quality control tested and conduct animal toxicity studies.

Assuming sufficient additional financing is available, of which no assurance can be provided, the Company would conduct a full preclinical program in anticipation of filing an IND to commence human clinical trials for safety and efficacy in patients with treatment resistant epilepsy and those requiring non-opioid treatments for pain.
 
In connection with the organization and development of the ResolutionRx and EndeavourRx business units, we are planning certain corporate and development actions as summarized below. All of the below are subject to raising additional financing and/or entering into strategic relationships, of which no assurance can be given.
 
Proposed Creation of Subsidiaries
 
Pending approval by the Board of Directors, management intends to organize our ResolutionRx and EndeavourRx business units into two subsidiaries: (i) a ResolutionRx subsidiary, into which we intend to contribute our pharmaceutical cannabinoid platform and its related tangible and intangible assets and certain of its liabilities and (ii) an EndeavourRx subsidiary, into which we plan to contribute our neuromodulator platform, including both the AMPAkine and GABAkine programs and their related tangible and intangible assets and certain of their liabilities.
 
Management believes that there are several advantages to separating these platforms formally into newly formed subsidiaries, including but not limited to optimizing their asset values through separate finance channels and making them more attractive for capital raising as well as for strategic deal making.
 
Employee/Consultant Infrastructure Build-out
 
It is anticipated that the Company will continue to use, at least initially, its management personnel to provide management, operational and oversight services to these two business units. In order to broaden our operational expertise, we are planning to hire a number of highly qualified individuals, either as employees or consultants and, in tandem, increase our administrative support function. To date, we have hired David Dickason as Senior Vice-president of Pre-Clinical Product Development and engaged Drs. James Cook and Jeffrey Witkin as consulting Research Fellows and engaged Dr. Rok Cerne as Senior Research Scientist.
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intensive research efforts, rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary therapeutics. Our competitors include many companies, research institutes and universities that are working in a number of pharmaceutical or biotechnology disciplines to develop therapeutic products similar to those we are currently investigating. Most of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and/or other resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have experience in performing human clinical trials of new or improved therapeutic products and obtaining approvals from the FDA and other regulatory agencies. We have no experience in conducting and managing later-stage clinical testing or in preparing applications necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. We expect that competition in this field will continue to intensify.
Regulatory Requirements for Drug Market Approval
 
The FDA and other similar agencies in foreign countries have substantial requirements for therapeutic products. Such requirements often involve lengthy and detailed laboratory, clinical and post-clinical testing procedures and are expensive to complete. It often takes companies many years to satisfy these requirements, depending on the complexity and novelty of the product. The review process is also extensive, which may delay the approval process further. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.

17

FDA approval is required before any new drug or dosage form, including the new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Other similar agencies in foreign countries also impose substantial requirements.
 
The process of developing drug candidates normally begins with a discovery process of potential candidates that are then initially tested in in vitro and in vivo non-human animal (preclinical) studies which include but are not limited to toxicity and other safety related studies, PK, PD and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion). Once sufficient preclinical data are obtained, a company must submit an IND and receive authorization from the FDA in order to begin clinical trials in the United States. Successful drug candidates then move into human studies that are characterized generally as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3. Phase 1 studies seeking safety and other data normally utilize healthy volunteers. Phase 2 studies utilize one or more prospective patient populations and are designed to establish safety and preliminary measures of efficacy. Sometimes studies may be referred to as Phase 2A and 2B depending on the size of the patient population. Phase 3 studies are large trials in the targeted patient population, performed in multiple centers, often for longer periods of time and are designed to establish statistically significant efficacy as well as safety in the larger population. Most often the FDA and similar regulatory agencies in other countries require two confirmatory Phase 3 or pivotal studies. Upon completion of both the preclinical and clinical phases, an NDA (New Drug Application) is filed with the FDA or a similar filing is made to the regulatory authority in other countries. NDA filings are extensive and include the data from all prior studies. These filings are reviewed by the FDA and, only if approved, may the company or its partners commence marketing of the new drug in the United States.
 
There also are variations of these procedures. For example, companies seeking approval for new indications for an already approved drug may choose to pursue an abbreviated approval process such as the filing for an NDA under Section 505(b)(2). Another example would be a Supplementary NDA (“SNDA”). A third example would be an Abbreviated NDA (“ANDA”) claiming bioequivalence to an already approved drug and claiming the same indications such as in the case of generic drugs. Other opportunities allow for accelerated review and approval based upon several factors, including potential fast-track status for serious medical conditions and unmet medical needs, potential breakthrough therapy designation of the drug for serious conditions where preliminary evidence shows that the drug may show substantial improvement over available therapy or orphan designation (generally, an orphan indication in the United States is one with a patient population of less than 200,000).
 
As of yet, we have not obtained any approvals to market our products. Further, we cannot assure you that the FDA or other regulatory agency will grant us approval for any of our products on a timely basis, if at all. Even if regulatory clearances are obtained, a marketed product is subject to continual review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketing or withdrawal of the product from the market.
 
The recent COVID-19 pandemic has made it very difficult to recruit subjects and patients and to conduct clinical trials in general and it is unclear how long these challenges will last. Given the public health emergency during the winter and spring of 2020 which continues into 2021, the FDA issued guidance to be implemented without the normal prior public comment period as the FDA had concluded that public participation would not be feasible or appropriate. Guidance is not legally enforceable, but the FDA recommends the following of its guidance. Challenges are expected to arise from quarantines, site closures, travel limitations, interruptions to the supply chain for investigational products, or other considerations if site personnel or trial subjects become infected with COVID-19. These challenges may lead to difficulties in meeting protocol-specified procedures. The FDA emphasized that safety of trial participants is critically important. Decisions to continue or discontinue individual patients or the trial are expected to be made by trial sponsors in consultation with clinical investors and Institutional Review Boards. COVID-19 screening procedures may need to be implemented. As challenging as the clinical trial process is during normal times, the risks, strategic and operational challenges and the costs of conducting such trials has increased substantially during the pandemic.

Manufacturing
 
We have no experience or capability to either manufacture bulk quantities of the new compounds that we develop, or to produce finished dosage forms of the compounds, such as tablets or capsules. We rely, and presently intend to continue to rely, on the manufacturing and quality control expertise of contract manufacturing organizations (see below with respect to dronabinol) or current and prospective corporate partners. There is no assurance that we will be able to enter into manufacturing arrangements to produce bulk quantities of our compounds on favorable financial terms. There is generally, absent any disruptions that may be caused by the current pandemic, substantial availability of both bulk chemical manufacturing and dosage form manufacturing capability throughout the world that we believe we can readily access.
 
On September 4, 2018, RespireRx entered into a dronabinol Development and Supply Agreement with Noramco Inc., one of the world’s major dronabinol manufacturers, which Noramco subsequently assigned to its subsidiary, Purisys LLC. Under the terms of the Purisys Agreement, Noramco agreed to (i) provide all of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) estimated to be needed for the clinical development process for both the first- and second-generation products (each a “Product” and collectively, the “Products”), three validation batches for New Drug Application (“NDA”) filing(s) and adequate supply for the initial inventory stocking for the wholesale and retail channels, subject to certain limitations, (ii) maintain or file valid drug master files (“DMFs”) with the FDA or any other regulatory authority and provide the Company with access or a right of reference letter entitling the Company to make continuing reference to the DMFs during the term of the agreement in connection with any regulatory filings made with the FDA by the Company, (iii) participate on a development committee, and (iv) make available its regulatory consultants, collaborate with any regulatory consulting firms engaged by the Company and participate in all FDA or Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) meetings as appropriate and as related to the API. We now refer to the second-generation product as our proprietary formulation or proprietary product and have de-emphasized the first-generation product.
 
In consideration for these supplies and services, the Company has agreed to purchase exclusively from Noramco during the commercialization phase all API for its Products (as defined in the Development and Supply Agreement) at a pre-determined price subject to certain producer price adjustments and agreed to Noramco’s participation in the economic success of the commercialized Product or Products up to the earlier of the achievement of a maximum dollar amount or the expiration of a period of time.
 
See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—We may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates and technologies” for a discussion of certain risks related to the development and commercialization of our products.
 
Marketing
 
We have no experience in the marketing of pharmaceutical products and do not anticipate having the resources to distribute and broadly market any products that we may develop. We will therefore continue to seek commercial development arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies for our proposed products for those indications that require significant sales forces to effectively market. In entering into such arrangements, we may seek to retain the right to promote or co-promote products for certain of the orphan drug indications in North America. We believe that there is a significant expertise base for such marketing and sales functions within the pharmaceutical industry and expect that we could recruit such expertise if we choose to directly market a drug.
 
See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—We may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates and technologies.”
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021 the Company employed two people on a full-time basis. We have four officers, two of whom are part-time outside consultants. The Company also engages other contractors who provide substantial services to the Company.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not own any real property or maintain any leases with respect to real property. The Company periodically contracts for services provided at the facilities owned by third parties and may, from time-to-time, have employees who work in these facilities.
Legal Proceedings
 
We are periodically subject to various pending and threatened legal actions and claims. See Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies – Pending or Threatened Legal Actions and Claims in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 for additional information regarding these matters.
 
The legal proceedings discussed in this report could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restitutions or other relief that could require significant expenditures or have other effects on our business. Management believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. The outcome of litigation and other legal proceedings is inherently uncertain, and it is possible that one or more of the matters currently pending or threatened could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for any particular period.
