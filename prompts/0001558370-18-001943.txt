     Item 1.Business
     As used herein, “CPI,” “we,” “our” and similar terms refer to CPI Card Group Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
     Overview
     We are a leading provider of comprehensive Financial Payment Card solutions in the United States. We define “Financial Payment Cards” as credit, debit and Prepaid Debit Cards issued on the networks of the “Payment Card Brands” (Visa, Mastercard®, American Express and Discover) and Interac (in Canada). We define “Prepaid Debit Cards” as debit cards issued on the networks of the Payment Card Brands, but not linked to a traditional bank account. We have established a leading position in the Financial Payment Card market through more than 20 years of experience and are focused primarily on this attractive subsector of the financial technology market. Our customers include leading national and regional banks, independent community banks, credit unions, managers of prepaid debit programs, “Group Service Providers” (organizations that assist small card issuers, such as credit unions, with managing their credit and debit card programs, including managing the Financial Payment Card issuance process) and card processors. We serve a diverse set of over 4,000 direct and indirect customers, including some of the largest issuers of debit and credit cards in the United States and Canada, and the largest U.S. Prepaid Debit Card program managers, as well as thousands of independent community banks, credit unions, Group Service Providers and card processors.
     We serve our customers through a network of production and card services facilities, including high-security facilities in the United States and Canada, each of which is certified by one or more of the Payment Card Brands and Interac (in Canada) and, where required by our customers, certified to be in compliance with the standards of the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (the “PCI Security Standards Council”). We have a leading network of high-security production facilities in the United States and Canada, allowing us to optimize our solutions offerings to serve the needs of our diverse customer base.
     We believe we have:
    
· | a leading position in the U.S. prepaid debit market, serving several of the top U.S. Prepaid Debit Card program managers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a leading position in the U.S. small to mid-sized issuer market, which includes independent community banks and credit unions, driven by our strong relationships, capabilities and technologies; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a solid position in the U.S. large issuer market, serving some of the largest U.S. debit and credit card issuers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In addition to our high-security facilities in the United States and Canada, we have facilities in the United Kingdom that produce retail cards, such as gift and loyalty cards, as well as provide personalization, packaging and fulfillment services.  Retail cards produced at our facilities in the United Kingdom are not issued on the networks of the Payment Card Brands.  
     In 2017, we generated:
    
· | net sales of $254.9 million, which represented a decrease of 17.4% compared to the prior year;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | net losses of $22.0 million, compared to net income of $5.4 million in the prior year; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cash provided by operating activities of $2.4 million, compared to cash flow provided by operating activities of $60.0 million during 2016.

      Our business consists of the following reportable segments: U.S. Debit and Credit, which primarily produces Financial Payment Cards and provides integrated card services to card-issuing banks in the United States; U.S. Prepaid Debit, which primarily provides integrated card services to Prepaid Debit Card issuers in the United States; and U.K.

Limited, which primarily produces retail cards, such as gift and loyalty cards for customers in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, and which are not certified by any of the Payment Card Brands or to be in compliance with the standards of the PCI Security Standards Council, but are certified to be in compliance with International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 27001 standards. Businesses not considered part of these segments are categorized as "Other" and include our operations in Ontario, Canada and, through 2015, Petersfield, United Kingdom.        During February 2018, we made the decision to consolidate our three personalization operations in the United States into two facilities to better enable us to optimize operations and achieve market-leading quality and service with a cost-competitive business model.  We plan to be substantially complete with the transition in the third quarter of 2018.  In August 2015, we completed the shut-down and closure of our operations at our Petersfield, United Kingdom facility. The Petersfield, United Kingdom facility was not material to our business. Also included in “Other” are corporate activities.
     For information regarding our net sales by geographic location and additional details regarding our segments, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 16 "Segment Reporting," and Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
     Our Competitive Strengths
    
· | Strong Market Position with Long-Term Customer Relationships. We are focused on becoming the partner of choice for our customers by providing market-leading quality products and customer service with a cost-competitive business model. We have long-standing trust-based relationships with customers, many of whom we have served for decades. Our customer relationships, particularly with those who utilize our card services and instant issuance systems and services, often involve process and technology integration. As a result, our customers are selective about working with partners they can trust to deliver the highest quality products and customer service. We strive to put our customers at the center of everything we do. We also maintain important relationships with the Payment Card Brands to ensure our facilities and processes consistently meet their standards.

· | Well Positioned to Capitalize on Expected Growth in Financial Payment Card Market and Remaining EMV® Conversion in the United States. Europay, Mastercard and Visa (“EMV”) is a global, technical standard, maintained by EMVCo for smart payment cards, and for payment terminals and automated teller machines that accept them. EMV cards are smart cards (also called chip cards) which store data on integrated circuits rather than magnetic stripes, although EMV cards may have magnetic stripes. EMV cards can be contact cards that must be physically inserted into a reader, contactless cards that can be read over a short distance using radio-frequency identification (“RFID”) technology, or cards with both contact and contactless functionality (“dual-interface EMV cards”). With the past investments made to our physical infrastructure and equipment platform in preparation for the EMV conversion, we believe that we continue to be well-positioned to meet future demand in the Financial Payment Card market, the remaining small to mid-sized issuer U.S. market conversion to EMV cards, and the longer-term U.S. market conversion to dual-interface EMV cards. In addition, we have made investments in premium product capabilities, such as our metal card offering, CPI MetalsTM, in response to market demand for premium card products.

· | Comprehensive End-to-End Card Solutions. The foundation of our leading market position with our small to mid-sized issuer customers is our comprehensive end-to-end Financial Payment Card solutions. Our solutions provide a full suite of products and card services required to produce, personalize and fulfill Financial Payment Cards, while maintaining the security requirements of the Payment Card Brands. We are integral to many of our customers’ card programs, pairing card production with an end-to-end offering of card data personalization and card services that are integrated within our customers’ operations. We provide card data personalization services for financial institutions and managers of Prepaid Debit Card programs that require technology integration, such as secure data links to transfer highly sensitive cardholder information. Similarly, our installed base of instant issuance systems at bank and credit union branches across the United States require comparable levels of customer integration, as our Card@Once® instant issuance system utilizes only our secure technology to instantly personalize cards. Certain customers have also integrated our proprietary software into their customer-facing websites to offer card

design and customization to their cardholders. We believe that our comprehensive solution allows our customers to choose a single trusted partner to address their card program needs in a cost-effective manner instead of managing multiple suppliers across a complex value chain.

· | Certified Network of High-Security Facilities. Our high-security facilities are each certified by one or more of the Payment Card Brands and Interac (in Canada), forming a leading network of certified production facilities in in the United States and Canada. The Payment Card Brand certifications allow us to produce cards bearing these brands and provide relevant card services for our issuer customers. Additionally, many of our facilities are also certified to be in compliance with the standards of the PCI Security Standards Council. These certification processes are long, complex and costly, and our facilities must comply with strict standards of security in order to obtain and retain this designation, which are regularly verified by both the Payment Card Brands and our customers.

· | Industry Experience and Proprietary and Patented Solutions. We continuously work to enhance our offerings and to create and deliver next generation products and solutions that meet the demands of the marketplace and our customers. Over the course of our long operating history, we have developed technological, engineering and operational expertise that we believe has made us a leader in our industry. We believe that our technological and operational capabilities, combined with our specific focus on the Financial Payment Card market, gives us a competitive advantage. We have developed and acquired intellectual property over our operating history and hold 20 U.S. patents, including five patents related to our CPI MetalsTM card solution, 10 foreign patents, as well as 27 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, on our Financial Payment Card solutions. We also have patents on our instant issuance offering and on our tamper-evident security packaging used by customers with Prepaid Debit Card offerings, and we hold exclusive production rights to certain products the Company has developed.

 Our Products and Services
     EMV Financial Payment Cards (Contact and Dual-Interface)
     We produce both plastic and metal contact EMV cards, which feature an integrated circuit that interfaces with an EMV payment terminal over a contact plate on the surface of the card when inserted into an EMV-enabled payment terminal. We also produce dual-interface EMV cards, which feature both the contact EMV technology and an RFID antenna that utilizes near field communications (“NFC”) technology to allow transactions to also be processed on a contactless basis when the card is brought within the requisite proximity to a NFC-enabled payment terminal.      Non-EMV Financial Payment Cards and Retail Gift Cards
     We produce non-EMV cards that utilize magnetic stripes, contactless cards which utilize NFC technology and cards that include both magnetic stripes and NFC technology. In addition, we produce retail gift cards (which are not issued on the network of the Payment Card Brands) primarily in the U.K.     Card Data Personalization and Fulfillment
     We provide data preparation and card data personalization solutions for debit, credit and Prepaid Debit Cards in contact EMV, dual-interface EMV and non-EMV card formats. Our personalization services are technology-driven and provide a wide range of card customization options, using advanced processes to personalize (encode, program and emboss with data such as cardholder name and account number) and fulfill cards to individual cardholders. In addition, we provide EMV data script development services for our customers and in certain cases generate PIN numbers and mailers on their behalf. We offer patented card design software, known as MYCA™, which provides our customers and their cardholders the ability to design cards on the internet and customize cards with individualized digital images. We also provide consultation and card design services to further assist customers in card customization.      Tamper-Evident Security Packaging Solutions
     We offer specialized and innovative tamper-evident security packaging products and services to customers with a Prepaid Debit Card offering that reduce fraud for Prepaid Debit Cards sold through the retail channel. The majority of the tamper-evident security packaging we produce is protected by our patents. In certain cases, we also manage the fulfillment of fully-completed Prepaid Debit Card packages to retail locations on behalf of our customers utilizing this solution.     Instant Card Issuance Systems and Services 
     We offer Card@Once®, our proprietary and patented instant card issuance system and services, which provides our card issuing bank customers the ability to issue a completely personalized permanent debit or credit card within the bank branch to individual cardholders upon demand. Our instant issuance system is enabled by cloud-based software that securely transfers data from our servers to the card branch to encode a magnetic stripe, an EMV card, or a dual-interface EMV card, and personalizes the card on a desktop output terminal in a process which is certified by Mastercard® and Visa. Our instant issuance system generates both system sales and recurring revenue from software as a service, card personalization and sales of cards and consumables. In addition, we provide instant issuance of debit cards to large financial institutions whereby we provide fully-personalized temporary debit cards which are issued to card holders upon opening a new account, and we manage the fulfillment and replenishment of these fully personalized cards directly to thousands of individual bank branches.
     CPI on DemandTM Solutions
     Through our CPI on DemandTM services, we are able to produce images, personalized payment cards and related collateral on a one-by-one, on demand basis for our customers, enabling individualized offerings and reducing waste.  While not significant to our 2017 financial results, we believe the CPI on DemandTM solution will further differentiate us with our financial institution customers, and we believe it will enable us to further penetrate new, business-to-business and business-to-consumer verticals of the prepaid market such as healthcare, transit, payroll, corporate incentives, benefits and insurance.

 Digital Services 
     While not currently significant to our financial results, we are focusing on enabling payments for the emerging digital payment marketplace, including self-service card customization, on demand fulfillment, order lifecycle management, customer inventory management, EMV key management, and other innovative solutions, such as digitizing and securely delivering payment credentials as a virtual payment method.      Suppliers
     One of the most important components of our products is the EMV microchip. While we have developed constructive relationships with our suppliers and, in general, receive a high level of cooperation and support from them, the objective of our procurement strategy is not to depend on any single supplier. We obtain our components from multiple suppliers located in South Korea, France, the United States and Singapore, primarily on a purchase order basis. Our main suppliers of EMV microchips are four leading international manufacturers, including one supplier that is also owned by a competitor. Approximately 90% of our purchased EMV microchips for the year ended December 31, 2017 came from these four main suppliers. The other key components for our products are substrates (such as PVC), antennas and inlays which we also source from multiple suppliers. We continuously monitor supply chain risks and evaluate alternative suppliers based on numerous attributes including quality, performance, service, scalability, features, innovation and price.     Customers
     In the United States, we categorize our customers as follows: large issuers, small to mid-sized issuers, prepaid debit issuers, program managers, Group Service Providers and card processors. Our diverse customer base includes some of the largest issuers of credit and debit cards in the United States and the largest U.S. Prepaid Debit Card program managers. Our top customer represented 12.4% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our top five customers represented approximately 28.5% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, and we have been serving these customers for an average of greater than 10 years.
     We generally enter into master purchase or service agreements that govern the general terms and conditions of our commercial relationships. We then enter into purchase order or other short-term arrangements that define the prices and the quantities of products to be delivered and services rendered. Usually, our contractual arrangements include neither exclusivity clauses nor commitments from our customers to order any given quantities of products on a medium or long-term basis.
     Production and Services
     Our production and services strategy has several key facets. We have a large network of integrated high-security facilities that we leverage to balance customer orders, expand the array of products and services available to our customers, provide consistent supply and execute short lead times. Our facilities and operating processes are designed to provide a differentiated level of service to each of our key customer sets. For example, we have the processes and capabilities to:
· | execute high-volume production runs that allow us to meet the competitive price points of large orders;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | execute lower-volume, highly customized runs that allow us to meet the high-service and quick-turn needs of smaller orders, as well as on demand solutions; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | meet the specific needs of our Prepaid Debit Card customers, as an industry leader in tamper-evident secure card packaging, and through our expertise and capabilities specifically designed for this retail prepaid market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We operate approximately 500,000 square feet of facilities in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, where we focus on Financial Payment Card production and personalization services. See Part I, Item 2, “Properties” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the operations of each facility.

 We rely on secure ground and secure air freight to deliver products to our banking customers. Due to the high-security nature of the products we provide to our banking customers, product must be shipped to these customers via a secure method, such as armored vehicle. With respect to customers for whom we fulfill individual and personalized debit and credit cards, we utilize the U.S., Canadian and U.K. postal services to deliver these cards directly to individual cardholders. For other customers, we predominately deliver our products via regular ground and air freight.
     Sales and Marketing
     We market ourselves as a leader and trusted partner in payments, seeking to meet or exceed the needs of our customers through high quality and meaningful, innovative products at competitive prices. We work to strategize and collaborate with our customers to bring them valuable and innovative solutions. We have approximately 30 field-based sales representatives that give us a wide geographic reach across the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. Our sales representatives offer a complete end-to-end solution that incorporates the full spectrum of our products and services from concept to delivery. Our sales and marketing strategy focuses on strengthening our relationships with existing customers through a consultative approach that includes cross-selling expanded services. We leverage the strength of our full-service offerings to attract new customers. Our marketing efforts focus on the needs of our specific types of customers. By tailoring our marketing strategy to different customer groups, we are able to provide relevant targeted solutions to meet their individual needs. We utilize an array of different marketing communications and thought leadership across various industry publications, editorial white papers, case studies, conferences and trade shows, print and digital advertisements and educational webinars to introduce our existing customers and new customers to innovations in the payments market. Through these efforts, we drive customer retention and satisfaction, and have been able to attract new customers.     Competition
     The market for products and services in the payment card industry is highly competitive. Some of our competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do, and therefore have substantial flexibility in competing with us, including through the use of integrated product offerings and competitive pricing. Competitive factors for our business include product quality, security, service reliability, product line comprehensiveness and integration, timely introduction of new products and features and price.
     Our products and services compete with other card manufacturers and card solutions providers. We believe our primary competitors are IDEMIA (formerly known as Oberthur Technologies S.A.), Giesecke & Devrient GmbH, Valid S.A., Gemalto NV, CompoSecure L.L.C., and Multi Packaging Solutions, Inc. Certain existing and potential customers also have the ability to personalize Financial Payment Cards in-house. In addition, we compete with customers that offer transaction processing products and services to financial institutions.  
     Intellectual Property
     We own and control various intellectual property rights, such as patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, service marks, tradenames, copyrights and applications. We are also a party to certain patent cross-license arrangements with industry participants and may, from time to time, enter into similar commercial agreements should we consider it necessary or beneficial for our business.
     We rely on a combination of statutory (copyright, trademark and trade secret) and contractual safeguards for intellectual property protection throughout the world. As of December 31, 2017, we had 35 U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and applications, 20 existing U.S. patents, 10 foreign patents, as well as 27 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. Our patents have an average remaining maturity of 12 years, and our trademarks will be due for renewal for additional ten or fifteen-year periods on an ongoing basis.
     Environmental Protection
     Our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental protection regulations, including those governing the emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations.

 Regulation
     Privacy and Data Security
     In the course of our business, we receive personally identifiable information of cardholders from our customers, either from a financial institution or through a card processor on behalf of a financial institution. Such information includes names, addresses, card account numbers and expiration dates. In some cases, we receive a cardholder’s PIN number. As a service provider to financial institutions in the United States, we are subject to certain Federal Trade Commission requirements, the privacy provisions of the Gramm‑Leach‑Bliley Act (the “GLBA”) and its implementing regulations and, as applicable, with various other federal and state privacy statutes and regulations, and the PCI Security Standards Council’s Data Security Standards, each of which is subject to change at any time. Outside of the United States, we are subject to privacy laws and regulations of numerous countries and jurisdictions, including the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) in the European Union. The interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux. 
     In order to comply with our obligations under the GLBA, applicable state laws and our contractual agreements with our customers, we are required to implement adequate policies and safeguards to protect the privacy of personally identifiable information we receive. As part of their compliance with these requirements, each of our U.S. customers is expected to have a program in place for protecting personally identifiable information and responding to unauthorized access to, or use of, personally identifiable information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to consumers, as required by law. A majority of U.S. states have enacted security breach legislation, requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach, which could result in significant costs to us and significant damage to our reputation.
     In May 2016, the European Union adopted the GDPR, which is a comprehensive general data privacy regulation that will replace the current EU Data Protection Directive and related country-specific legislation. The GDPR will become fully effective in May 2018. The regulation will impose more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data of residents of the European Union, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, mandatory data breach notification requirements and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. The regulation will also include significant penalties for non-compliance. 
     We are also subject to requirements from the Payment Card Brands, which require us to meet certain security standards in order to achieve certification that allows us to produce and personalize Financial Payment Cards issued on their networks. These standards include extensive requirements with respect to the physical characteristics of our facilities, as well as our electronic treatment and storage of cardholder data. We believe that we have developed significant expertise in acquiring and maintaining these certifications, and have invested significant capital to obtain and retain these designations, which are regularly verified by both the Payment Card Brands and our customers. We believe the long, complex and costly certification process serves as a significant barrier to new entrants to our market.
     The interpretation of pending and existing laws and regulations is evolving and, therefore, these laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently. It is possible that our current data protection policies and practices may be deemed inconsistent with new legal requirements or interpretations thereof, and breaches in the security of our systems and technology could result in a violation of these laws and regulations. Changes to these laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with and may delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. 
     Financial Services
     We are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks, thrifts and credit unions. However, as a provider of products and services to these financial institutions, our operations may be examined by various state and federal regulatory authorities and representatives of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, which is a formal inter-agency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions. Also, state and federal regulations

require our financial institution clients to include certain provisions in their contracts with service providers like us and to conduct ongoing monitoring and risk management for third party relationships. In addition, we engage independent auditors annually to review certain of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients’ auditors.
     In conducting certain of our card services, we are directly subject to various federal and state laws and regulations including those relating to the movement of money. In order to comply with our obligations under applicable laws, we are required, among other things, to comply with licensing and reporting requirements, to implement operating policies and procedures to comply with anti-money laundering laws, to protect the privacy and security of our clients’ information and to undergo periodic audits and examinations.
     In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted. The Dodd-Frank Act introduced substantial reforms to the supervision and operation of the financial services industry, including introducing changes that: affect the oversight and supervision of financial institutions; provide for a new resolution procedure for large financial companies; introduce more stringent regulatory capital requirements; implement changes to corporate governance and executive compensation practices; and require significant rule-making. The Dodd-Frank Act has generated numerous new regulations that have imposed compliance costs and, in some cases, limited revenue sources for us and our clients. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) which is empowered to conduct rule-making and supervision related to, and enforcement of, federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has issued guidance that applies to “supervised service providers” which the CFPB has defined to include service providers, like us, to CFPB supervised banks and nonbanks. The CFPB has in the past and may in the future issue regulations that may require us to make compliance investments and/or limit our fees or other revenue sources. We do not currently anticipate a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition due to these regulations, but it is difficult to predict with certainty the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients.
     Employees and Labor
     As of December 31, 2017, our businesses employed approximately 1,200 employees.  We have never experienced any work stoppages or strikes as a result of labor disputes.  We consider our relations with employees to be good.      Available Information
