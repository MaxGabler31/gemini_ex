History of the Company
 
Wave Sync Corp. (the “Company”), formerly known as China Bio-Energy Corp., formerly known as China INSOnline Corp., was initially incorporated on December 23, 1988 as Lifequest Medical, Inc. (“DEXT”) as a Delaware corporation. On December 6, 2010, the Company entered into an Amendment (the “Amendment”) to a certain share exchange agreement dated November 12, 2010 with Ding Neng Holdings, a British Virgin Islands company (“Ding Neng Holdings”). This share exchange agreement and the Amendment provides for an acquisition transaction in which the Company, through the issuance of 25,875,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.001, representing 90% of the issued and outstanding common stock immediately following the closing of this acquisition, acquired 100% of Ding Neng Holdings.
 
The closing of this acquisition took place on February 10, 2011, on which date, pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement as amended, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Ding Neng Holdings from the shareholders of Ding Neng Holdings; and the shareholders of Ding Neng Holdings transferred and contributed all of their issued and outstanding shares of Ding Neng Holdings to the Company. Accordingly, on the closing of the acquisition, the Company, via Ding Neng Holdings, held 100% of Ding Neng Bio-technology Co., Limited, a Hong Kong Company, which held 100% of Zhangzhou Fuhua Biomass Energy Technology Co., Ltd., a wholly-foreign owned enterprise in China (“Fuhua Biomass”), which, via a series of variable interest entity (or VIE) arrangements, controlled the operating company Fujian Zhangzhou Ding Neng Bio-technology Co., Ltd. (“Ding Neng Bio-tech”). In connection of this share exchange, the Company changed its fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31.
 
In or about early October 2011, Mr. Nie Xinfeng, the Company’s former chairman of the Board of Directors (the “Board”), took possession of, among other things, the company seal, financial seal, and original books and records of Ding Neng Bio-tech. Since then, the Company was prevented from obtaining and did not have access to the financial information of Ding Neng Bio-tech.
 
The Company and the previous management believed that from late 2011 to 2014, due to change in law, unfavorable market conditions, and lack of effective management, the business of Ding Neng Bio-tech deteriorated significantly and eventually the Company defaulted on various loan obligations. The Company also believes that Ding Neng Bio-tech guaranteed some of Mr. Nie’s personal debts. From 2011 to 2014, multiple legal proceedings were brought against Ding Neng Bio-tech by creditors, service vendors and former employees of the Company and against Mr. Nie by his creditors. As a result, substantially all of Ding Neng Bio-tech’s assets were seized or disposed of by Ding Neng Bio-tech’s or Mr. Nie’s creditors. Eventually, Ding Neng Bio-tech completely ceased its operations.
 
On June 4, 2015, Fuhua Biomass filed a civil action in Haicang District People’s Court of Xiamen, Fujian, PRC (the “Court”) against Ding Neng Bio-tech, alleging that the purposes of those certain Consulting Service Agreement, Operating Agreement, Pledge and Security Agreement, Option Agreement, and Voting Rights Proxy Agreement (the “VIE Agreements”) entered into by Fuhua Biomass and Ding Neng Bio-tech on October 28, 2010 had been frustrated, and that these VIE Agreements should be terminated. Fuhua Biomass alleged that Ding Neng Bio-tech did not make any payment of service fees to Fuhua Biomass, and that Ding Neng Bio-tech failed to perfect the security interest in the pledged stock. On July 14, 2015, this case was settled via in-court mediation directed by the Court. As a result, Fuhua Biomass and Ding Neng Bio-tech entered into binding settlement (i) to terminate the VIE Agreements, (ii) to acknowledge that Fuhua Biomass and Ding Neng Bio-tech did not have any other disputes over this case, and (iii) that the litigation fee in the amount of RMB10,000 (approximately $1,610.5) would be borne by Ding Neng Bio-tech.
 
Given that the Company was unable to exercise effective control over Ding Neng Bio-tech or gain access to Ding Neng Bio-tech’s financial information since 2011, and that the VIE Agreements were terminated, the Company deconsolidated Ding Neng Bio-tech’s financial results.

During a review of the Company’s financial statements by its auditor, the auditor examined the share register and all the debts provided to or by the Company, and instruments of transfer provided by the Secretary of the Company. There was no evidence that ownership of Ding Neng Holdings was ever registered to be transferred and held by the Company. The Company also discovered that Ding Neng Holdings was delinquent and defunct. Accordingly, it was unable to determine whether the Company was registered as the sole shareholder of Ding Neng Holdings pursuant to the share exchange agreement dated November 12, 2010, as amended on December 6, 2010. As a result, the Company excluded the accounts of Ding Neng Holdings and its subsidiaries in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as contained herein. The Company has written off all investments made in Ding Neng Holdings as loss on investment in subsidiary.
 
Share Purchase Agreement with EGOOS Mobile Technology Co. Ltd.
 
On October 19, 2015, the Registrant entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with EGOOS Mobile Technology Company Limited, a British Virgin Islands holding company (“EGOOS BVI”), which owns 100% of EGOOS Mobile Technology Company Limited, a Hong Kong company (“EGOOS HK”), which owns 100% of Move the Purchase Consulting Management (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. (“WOFE” or “Yigou”), a foreign investment enterprise organized under the laws of the PRC, and which has, through various contractual agreements, management control and the rights to the profits of Guangzhou Yuzhi Information Technology Co., Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of the PRC as a variable interest entity(“Guangzhou Yuzhi”), which owns 100% of Shenzhen Qianhai Exce-card Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese corporation (“Shenzhen Exce-card”), which owns 100% of Guangzhou Rongsheng Information Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese corporation (“Guangzhou Rongsheng”, together with Guangzhou Yuzhi and Shenzhen Exce-card, is collectively referred to herein as “Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries”), and the sole shareholder of EGOOS BVI. Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries engage in research, development, marketing and distribution of inlays/audio chips for audio bank card products.
 
The Share Purchase Agreement provided for an acquisition transaction (the “Acquisition”) in which the Registrant, through the issuance of a convertible note in the principal sum of Fifteen Million U.S. Dollars ($15,000,000) to EGOOS BVI’s sole shareholder, acquired 100% of EGOOS BVI.
 
The closing of the Acquisition (the “Closing”) took place on October 19, 2015 (the “Closing Date”). On the Closing Date, pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Registrant acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of EGOOS BVI from the sole shareholder of EGOOS BVI; and the shareholder of EGOOS BVI transferred and contributed all of his issued and outstanding shares of EGOOS BVI to the Registrant. In exchange, the Registrant issued to the sole shareholder of EGOOS BVI a convertible note, which was subsequently converted into an aggregate of 15,000,000 post-Reverse Split (as defined below) Common Shares of the Registrant. There is no material relationship between the sole shareholder of EGOOS BVI and/or EGOOS BVI, on one hand, and the Company and its affiliates or associates, on the other hand. Upon conversion of the note (the “Conversion”), the then existing shareholders of the Registrant collectively own an aggregate of 24.7% of the post-Acquisition entity.
 
On August 5, 2015, Yigou entered into an Exclusive Service Agreement which entitled Yigou to receive substantially all of the economic benefits of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries in consideration of services provided by Yigou to Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries. In addition, Yigou entered into certain agreements with each of Wenbin Yang, Ping Li, (collectively, the “Guangzhou Yuzhi shareholders”), as well as Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries, including (i) a Call Option Agreement allowing Yigou to acquire the shares of Guangzhou Yuzhi as permitted by PRC laws, (ii) a Voting Rights Proxy Agreement that provided Yigou with the voting rights of the Guangzhou Yuzhi shareholders and those of Guangzhou Yuzhi, and (iii) an Equity Pledge Agreement that pledged the shares in Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries to Yigou. This VIE structure provides Yigou, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EGOOS HK, with control over the operations and benefits of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries without having a direct equity ownership in Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries (EGOOS BVI, EGOOS HK, Guangzhou Yuzhi, Shenzhen Exce-card, Guangzhou Rongsheng and Yigou are collectively referred to herein as the “Group”).

EGOOS BVI’s organizational structure was crafted to abide by the laws of the PRC and maintain tax benefits as well as internal organizational efficiencies. EGOOS BVI’s post–Acquisition organization structure is summarized below:
 


Reverse Stock Split
 
On October 13, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors and stockholders collectively holding approximately 70.5% of the Company’s outstanding common stock executed a joint written consent approving a reverse stock split at a ratio of one-for-twenty (the “Reverse Split”). A Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation effecting the Reverse Split was filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware on December 1, 2015.
Business Overview
 
EGOOS BVI, a British Virgin Islands business company, acts as a holding company and indirectly controls Guangzhou Yuzhi (a variable interest entity in China) and its Subsidiaries. EGOOS BVI’s sole source of income and operations is through its indirect, contractual control of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries.
 
Based in the city of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, Guangzhou Yuzhi and Guangzhou Rongsheng are principally engaged in software and information technology services and share full-time employees with Shenzhen Exce-card.
 
Shenzhen Exce-card is based in the city of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, with a business development department in New York, NY. Additionally, Shenzhen Exce-card has entered into a partnership agreement with UINT France located in Saint Aubin, France (“UINT”), amended and supplemented by an amendment dated March 27, 2015 (as amended and supplemented, the “Partnership Agreement”), pursuant to which UINT was engaged by Shenzhen Exce-card to conduct product research and development (“R&D”) and other related services in connection with new audio signals, testing and producing new inlays for audio bank card and assisting the card manufacturers with lamination test, new generation of audio card, and assisting the card manufacturers with certification of the new audio card products. This Partnership Agreement was terminated in 2018 due to lack of sales of the audio cards.

In February 2015, Shenzhen Exce-card developed an electronic inlay utilizing innovative audio technology and embedded in a specialized IC card product, namely, “audio bank card.” We were granted the patent pertaining to such audio bank cards inlay, which will expire in 2023. The audio bank cards meet innovative product standards set forth by UnionPay, the only domestic bank card organization in China as well as the only interbank network in mainland China. UnionPay has authorized its logo to be displayed on the audio bank cards. However, it should be noted that we have no contractual agreement or arrangement with UnionPay with respect to audio bank cards.
 
We intended to supply and sell electronic inlays embedded with audio chips and other modules to card manufacturers, such as Hengbao Co., Ltd. (“Hengbao”) and Wuhan Tianyu Information Industry Co., Ltd. (“Tianyu”). However, we stopped the negotiations with Hengbao and Tianyu in 2018. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we generated revenue in the amount of approximately $85,573 from providing technology consulting services.
 
Our Business Plan
 
We encountered challenges to expand the sales of our audio bank cards. Mobile phone payments through smart phone apps, such as Wechat and Venmo, have become one of the most popular methods to make payments. As of the date of this annual report, we ceased our efforts to market and sell our audio bank cards.
 
We sought to develop relationships with major card issuers in China since 2014 until 2018. We promoted two pilot programs with China Construction Bank (“CCB”), one of China’s four major banks; however, we could not continue the pilot programs due to lack of positive market reaction.
 
On August 22, 2016, we announced that Guangdong Qilong Internet Technology Co., Ltd. (“Qilong”), a high technology company based in Guangzhou, China, and one of the Company’s subsidiaries, Shenzhen Exce-card, entered into a strategic agreement to jointly develop the next generation of audio bank cards within the China Union Pay network. Qilong and the Company agreed to stop pursuing the strategic agreement referenced above.
 
On February 15, 2017, we, through Shenzhen Exce-card, entered into a card supply agreement (the “SD Card Supply Agreement”) with SmartDisplayer Technology, Co. Ltd. (“SmartDisplayer”), a company incorporated under the law of Taiwan, Republic of China, pursuant to which SmartDisplayer agreed to supply audio bank cards in compliance with Shenzhen Exce-card’s specifications and the ISO 7810 standard and in amounts requested by Shenzhen Exce-card from time to time for a term of two years commencing from the execution date of the SD Card Supply Agreement. We never put any purchase order from SmartDisplayer due to lack of demand for our audio cards.
 
Our Customers
 
During the fiscal year of 2018, we provided technology consulting services to our customer(s). We are in the process of shifting our business focus to find additional sources of revenue.

Marketing
 
Since we are in a business transition period, we conducted very limited marketing activities in the fiscal year of 2018. We stopped the efforts with Qilong with respect to the customer base development.
Research and Development
 
Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement between Shenzhen Exce-card and UINT, for the period from May 1, 2014 to April 30, 2016, Shenzhen Exce-card paid UINT €120,000 for R&D services, €20,000 of which was for developing new audio signals of new audio card product, €30,000 of which was for the testing of new Inlay and assisting the card manufacturers with lamination test, €50,000 of which was for the conception of new generation audio cards, and the last €20,000 of which was for assisting the card manufacturers with certification of the new audio card product. Another €60,000 was loaned to UINT to cover its operation costs. We ceased the cooperation relationship with UINT in 2018.
Employees
 
A part of our employees are located in China. As of the date of this annual report, Guangzhou Yuzhi and its subsidiaries had four (4) employees in China and seven (7) employees are located in the U.S. There are no collective bargaining contracts covering any of our employees. We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.
 
We are required to contribute a portion of our employees’ total salaries to the Chinese government’s social insurance funds, including medical insurance, unemployment insurance and workers’ compensation insurance, and a housing assistance fund, in accordance with relevant regulations. Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries are currently paying social insurance for all of their four (4) full-time employees through a third party agent.

Insurance companies in China offer limited business insurance products. While business interruption insurance is available to a limited extent in China, we have determined that the risks of interruption, cost of such insurance and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. As a result, we could face liability from the interruption of our business.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Currently we have five (5) valid patents that were granted by the State Intellectual Property Office of the P.R.C. (“SIPO”) and the terms of which are ten years from the dates of grant of the patent applications. The five patents relate to the audio bank card technology and designs and its transaction system, such as the design of the circuit board embedded in the audio card, the transaction platform processing the audio data and the design of the audio chip. Two of the five patents were granted on May 4, 2016 and the rest were granted respectively on January 22, 2014, September 9, 2015 and December 23, 2015. Our patents were fully impaired in the fiscal year of 2018.
 
We obtained one trademark of the Company’s logo from SIPO on August 21, 2016, which remains valid until August 20, 2026. On April 23, 2015, the Company through one of its subsidiaries obtained the copyright on its software of Zhuozhi Changtian bank audio card application for micro and small businesses.
 
Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, any background information and know-how used in connection with the agreement remain the property of the party introducing such background information. UINT’s know-how relating to the services it provides under this agreement remains the exclusive property of UINT and it may use such know-how for other clients. Additionally, the costs and rights of any patent related to the new audio bank card product arises during the Term are borne by and shared equally by both parties.
 
Government Approval and Regulation
 
Due to the limited business operations, we were subject to very few regulations and governmental approvals in the fiscal year of 2018. We believe that we have been compliant to date with all requirements required by the applicable governing authorities in China with respect to the technology consulting services.
Going Concern
 
As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, as of December 31, 2018, the Company had accumulated deficits of $27,059,112 and working capital deficit of current liabilities exceeding current assets by $1,407,762 due to the substantial losses in operation in previous periods. Management’s plan to support the Company in operations and to maintain its business strategy is to raise funds through public and private offerings and to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation. If we do not raise all of the money we need from public or private offerings, we will have to find alternative sources, such as loans or advances from our officers, directors or others. Such additional financing may not become available on acceptable terms and there can be no assurance that any additional financing that the Company does obtain will be sufficient to meet its needs in the long term. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. If we require additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations or cease business entirely. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
