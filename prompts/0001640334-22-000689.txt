The Company’s History

BioAdaptives, Inc., ("BioAdaptives," the "Company," "we" or "us") was incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 19, 2013, as APEX 8 Inc. From inception through October 21, 2013, the Company was in the developmental stage and conducted virtually no business operations, other than organizational activities and preparation of a registration statement on Form 10-12g (the "Registration Statement"), which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 3, 2013.  On June 11, 2013, the SEC staff informed the Company that it had no further comments 

On January 10, 2014, the SEC notified the Company that the registration statement was effective and on July 9, 2014, the Company’s shares commenced trading in the Over-the-Counter market under the trading symbol BDPT. 

On March 31, 2017, the Company filed a Form 15-15D with the SEC, terminating its status as an SEC-reporting company; it was current in its Continuous Disclosure obligations at that time.  The Company continued to provide financial and other reports to shareholders and the public by means of the Alternative Reporting System operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. Its shares continued to trade in the OTC market and it also continued to execute its business plan.  

On May 10, 2019, the Company filed a Form 10-12g with the SEC, re-entering the Continuous Disclosure program and registering its common stock under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  On August 1, 2019, the SEC staff informed the Company that it had no further comments on this filing.  

On September 11, 2019, the Company appointed Robert Ellis as President and Ron Lambrecht as Chief Financial Officer.  Dr. Jacobs remained as Chief Executive Officer.

On February 6, 2020, the Board of Directors exercised its authority under the Delaware General Corporations Law to establish its Series A Preferred Stock.  The Series A has enhanced voting and conversion privileges and can be used by the Company to settle recorded debt or exchange for new product rights or techniques.  On this same day, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company’s authorized common stock from 100,000,000 to 200,000,000; holders of a majority of the Company’s common shares consented to the increase. 

Effective May 31, 2021, Dr. Jacobs appointed Robert Ellis and Charles Townsend as directors of the Company and to serve as President and Chief Operating Officer respectively.  Dr. Jacobs also appointed Ronald Lambrecht as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer.  Effective December 31, 2021, Mr. Lambrecht resigned. 

On January 26, 2022, the Board of Directors exercised its authority under the Delaware General Corporations Law to establish its Series B Preferred Stock.  The Series B has enhanced voting and conversion privileges and can be used by the Company to acquire ownership of intellectual property rights and other assets.  On this same day, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company’s authorized common stock from 200,000,000 to 750,000,000; this increase received the consent of the holders of a majority of the Company’s common shares.

The Company’s Business

Overview

BioAdaptives’ core business is to investigate, market and distribute natural plant- and algal-based products and medical devices that improve health and wellness for humans and animals, with an emphasis on pain relief, anti-viral function, and anti-aging properties.

Effective November 15, 2021, the Company entered into a marketing agreement for an FDA-cleared Class II medical device, the Lung Flute™.  The Company is also exploring agreements with other medical device manufacturers; the owners of intellectual property relating to medical devices and processes; and marketing companies associated with these manufacturers and owners.

The Company’s current products include dietary supplements using natural ingredients and proprietary methods of optimizing the availability of nutrients in foods and beverages. The human products are designed to aid memory, cognition and focus; assist in sleep and fatigue reduction; provide pain relief and healing; and improve overall emotional and physical wellness.  The science behind our human products has proven to be effective for performance enhancement and pain relief for horses and dogs as well as providing improvements in appearance.  

Our current product line for humans includes PrimiCell®, PluriPain®, PrimiLungs™, PrimiLive® and PrimiSleep™.  We also market the Lung Flute™ and PrimiLungs™ product in our Lung Armor™ packaging, emphasizing the anti-viral properties of the nutraceutical and general respiratory health benefits from use of the device.  PrimiLive® is a nootropic formulation that enhances mental clarity and endurance; PrimiSleep™ is a natural soporific that aids relaxation and sleep quality.  We acquired the licenses for these products during 2021, and have commence marketing activities for these products.

Our animal products include Canine Regen® and Equine Regen® for dogs and horses, along with versions of the base formulations, including an Equine All-in-One® formulation evolved from Equine Regen® to trainers, horse owners and boarding stables.  Anecdotal and testimonial reports are that the equine products provide significant relief from exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhaging, as well as improved coat and mane appearance and hoof health.  

Effective February 2, 2022, the Company acquired the exclusive option to purchase U.S. Patent No. 9,783,432B (the “Patent”), covering technology used in enhancing the capability of water to hold significantly larger amounts of oxygen. The Agreement also allows the Company a two-year license to use the technology covered by the Patent, including for further development of oxygenated water products for consumers.  The Agreement is more fully discussed in the Company’s Form 8-K filed on February 6, 2022. The Company intends to develop consumer products using the oxygenation technology, and has formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, MORO2, Inc. to conduct these activities.

While we continue to investigate and acquire nutraceutical products for humans and animals, all of our current activities are reliant on marketing and distributing products developed and owned by others. We do not own the formulations for our key products and manufacture and market them under an agreement with the developer that requires payment of a royalty and license agreement

We are reliant on direct and indirect sales of the Primi and Pluri lines for humans and the Regen and All-in-One animal products for revenues, along with Lung Armor™, none of which has produced any significant revenue yet.  We have very limited experience in marketing and have yet to develop reliable sales expectations and forecasting.

Market and Marketing

We market our science-based, quality nutraceuticals to a broad base of the population in the U.S., and are exploring marketing prospects in Asia, Australasia, the Middle East, and Europe. The Company’s current target markets also include equine and canine companion animals and equine competitors in the U.S., Australasia and the Middle East.

During June 2021, we commenced use of social media professionals and existing connections to create awareness about our human products’ benefits.  The initial results were not satisfactory and a recast, animal product-specific program that followed later in 2021, similarly failed.  We are developing affiliate marketing opportunities and recognized that a broader campaign using traditional advertising along with social media and more contemporary marketing tools is necessary.

We are pursuing scientific surveys and other testing to demonstrate the usefulness of our products.  While we do not anticipate developing testing protocols suitable for FDA approvals, we expect anecdotal and testimonial reports that will be useful in our marketing efforts.  The Company is currently participating in a survey involving the use of PluriPain® by patients suffering from Gadolinium Deposition Disease (“GDD”).  The survey, conducted in collaboration with a research team affiliated with Stanford University, has produced early promising results with 60% of a small subject population reporting significant relief.  We have undertaken preliminary steps toward developing a survey/research protocol for use of the Lung Flute™ by long-term tobacco smokers and persons regularly exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke.  We expect to continue these explorations in 2Q and 3Q 2022.

Our products have not changed, except for refinements and improvements, and we will continue to emphasize the unique qualities, use and function of our nutraceuticals.  We intend to create market share in our target demographic by (i) emphasizing the benefits of our proprietary algal-based, all-natural, stimulant-free, non-GMO ingredients that combine with proven Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic botanicals into science-based formulations, (ii) investigating additional products in response to market demand and testing, and (iii) utilizing our marketing operation to act as its sales and distribution arm to seek additional channels for sales coverage.  

As noted above, we entered into licensing agreements for the PrimiLive® and PrimiSleep™ products during 2021.  While these products are all-natural botanical formulations, as our other nutraceutical products, they represent a departure from our existing product lines because they are targeted to specific markets:  PrimiLive® is a nootropic, intended to improve concentration and mental acuity; our initial marketing efforts are oriented toward e-gamers.  PrimiSleep™ is intended for use as an aid to relaxation, with an emphasis on improving the quality of sleep.  We believe these products can be used in a complementary manner, to maintain on-task endurance and then to unwind and recover from such activities.  

The Lung Flute™, especially when used with PrimiLungs™, shows great promise.  The device is an FDA-cleared Class II medical device that employs user-generated acoustic waves to loosen lung secretions for expulsion.  In short, the device helps users clear their lungs.  In conjunction with the anti-viral function of PrimiLungs™, the Lung Armor™ package presents great opportunities in view of current fears of an endemic viral environment.

In addition, we are investigating the use of a formulation of PluriPain® targeted toward the symptoms of pre-menstrual syndrome and menstrual pain.  Anecdotal and testimonial reports have long noted that users obtain relief from these symptoms with use of the PluriPain® product, and we have made adjustments and additions to the formulation to target these symptoms.  Early reports regarding “PluriPain-PMS” are promising, and we expect marketing efforts to emphasize the usefulness of the new product.

The Company believes that products using our oxygenated water technology will be useful and commercially viable.  Water products manufactured using the technology demonstrate dissolved O2 levels approaching above 80mg/L that persist over an extended period, which greatly exceeds levels and persistence in other commercial products. Users of oxygenated water produced with our technology report enhanced physical endurance, stamina and performance. We are currently arranging a Pilot Run of an ingestible oxygenated water product and are exploring usage in topical and other applications.

With regard to animal products, in 2020, the Company formed the Livestock Impact Division. The President of the Division is Bruce Colclasure, a National Cutting Horse Association champion who owns and operates the Flying C Bar Ranch, and is the breeder and trainer of over 80 NCHA champion cutting horses.  Mr. Colclasure uses and endorses our Equine All-in-One®, EquineRegen® and EquineRegen® Plus products and provides valuable feedback and testimonials regarding its function.  In addition, a high-performance formulation of our All-in-One product is used by quarter horse trainers at facilities in Oklahoma and New Mexico, with exceptional results.  We expect to use these results in our marketing efforts in 2022 and to expand our outreach program for performance horse trainers.

In light of the failures of our social media campaigns, in 2021, we commenced a marketing affiliate outreach program, directly contacting the principals of horse clubs and associations, offering discounts, samples and other inducements, seeking to develop “product champion” and “maven” relationships.  We have contacted principals in organizations with thousands of members and many more thousands of horses.  We have distributed samples and marketing materials to approximately 40 principals and influencers in regional and breed-specific equine associations and anticipate feedback from these marketing initiatives in the fourth quarter. Our expectation is that use of the samples by these principals will demonstrate improvements in appearance and performance and that they will, in turn, recommend the product to their members.  We delayed contracting for print and on-line ads with certain of these organizations, as well as traditional magazine and other print placements, pending the results of our sample program, which we expected to learn in 1Q and 2Q 2022.  We have, effective March 3, 2022, arranged for a print ad campaign, which will begin in one publication during April 2022, and expand later in 2022.

The Company believes that the population growth in the seasoned and geriatric demographic cohort presents a unique opportunity. The World Health Organization has stated that the 60 years and over population segment will more than double from 11% to over 22% between 2000 and 2050, with the absolute number of people aged 60 and over expected to increase to 2 billion within the same period. The Company also recognizes the rising buying power and interests of the Millennials in wellness products and their choice of communication medium being social media and internet. It intends to establish a major focus to capture the anticipated growth in this sector.  We believe that our social media promotion program will eventually gain traction and generate revenues. We are actively seeking a workable, efficient formula to grow consumer engagement and product sales.

The Company believes that international sales represent a significant future growth opportunity as aging population growth outside North America exceeds 1 billion people. The Company plans to aggressively pursue international sales by adding salespeople to its marketing effort, including use of social media influencers, developing a network in high-growth APAC regions, and continuing its efforts to register products and trademarks in attractive foreign markets.

Manufacturing

All of the Company’s nutraceutical products are considered dietary supplements or natural foods, and we carefully avoid making health, drug or disease cure claims that could trigger regulatory compliance issues and affect our ability to market BioAdaptives products. Our active ingredients are all plant- or algal-based and sourced worldwide from reputable suppliers who employ stringent compliance and sustainable agriculture practices or operate NSF-certified (or equivalent) facilities.  

We contract exclusively with manufacturers that utilize pharmaceutical grade facilities to assemble and package our products, all of which is subject to our inspection and approval. Fulfillment of retail internet and direct-to-reseller orders are conducted from our warehouse facilities. BioAdaptives actively investigates new products, techniques and novel applications of existing products or technology in our research. The Company’s research work has centered on investigations of all-natural supplement formulations that activate primitive cells, including stem cells and their derivatives, and natural ingredients that encourage stem cell proliferation.

With regard to medical devices, we purchase the LungFlute™ from a company affiliated with the patent holder; it too is manufactured in NSF-certified/GMP-compliant facilities.  We do not expect to develop any direct capability to manufacture medical devices for numerous reasons, including a lack of capital and the fact that amortized cost of such facilities, if we were to construct or acquire them, is generally far higher compared to the cost of purchase of a finished product.  

We are exploring the means to bring one or more oxygenated water products to market.  Our technology has been employed in large scale plants to produce bottled water, so we know that process is viable and the machinery functional. The costs of using our technology is modest – pennies per bottle – but we recognize there are numerous better-capitalized manufacturers, many of whom also have excellent branding.  We are currently arranging a Pilot Run of our oxygenated water product and intend to roll-out a marketing program based on user testimonials.  We will also consider licensing opportunities with competitors or other manufacturers.  

As noted above, it is our intention to operate primarily as a marketing company, developing consumer markets for nutraceutical products and medical devices that we license or market for others.  

Employees

The Company currently has 3 full-time executive employees and 4 part-time employees.  We retain hourly labor on an as-needed basis and professional consultants to operate our business.

Management of the Company expects to continue use of outside consultants, attorneys, and accountants, as necessary, so long as it is seeking and evaluating business opportunities.

The need for additional employees, and their availability, will be addressed in connection with the decision whether or not to acquire or participate in specific business opportunities.
