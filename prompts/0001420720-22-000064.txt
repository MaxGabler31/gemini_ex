Item 1. Business.
Overview
iBio, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”, “iBio”, “iBio, Inc” or the “Company”) is a developer of next-generation biopharmaceuticals using our proprietary Artificial Intelligence (“AI”)-Driven Discovery Platform and FastPharming® Manufacturing System. We are focusing our technologies on the research and development of novel products at its Drug Discovery Center in California. We are currently using our FastPharming Manufacturing System (“FastPharming” or the “FastPharming System”) and GlycaneeringSM Technologies to develop our portfolio of proprietary biologic drug candidates. We also offer contract development and manufacturing services from its 130,000 square foot cGMP facility in Texas.
We operate in two segments: (i) Biopharmaceuticals; its large molecule discovery, development, and licensing activities, and (ii) Bioprocessing; its contract development and manufacturing services for recombinant proteins. 
On September 19, 2022, we acquired substantially all of the assets of RubrYc Therapeutics, Inc. (“RubrYc”) which included:

● | AI Drug Discovery Platform: A patented system that uses artificial intelligence (“AI”) to design 3D models of subdominant and conformational epitopes to facilitate the creation of antibody drug candidates against previously hard-to-target tumors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Previously Licensed Candidates: All rights, with no future milestone payments or royalty obligations, to IBIO-101, an IL-2 sparing anti-CD25 antibody for depletion of regulatory T cells, along with the jointly discovered monoclonal antibody (“Target 6”) that was identified in Q2 FY2022 using the Discovery Engine.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New Therapeutic Candidates: Three immuno-oncology candidates, plus a partnership-ready PD-1 agonist for serious autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We expect the addition of new therapeutic candidates and an AI-driven drug discovery platform for difficult to treat tumors to strengthen its Biopharmaceutical discovery and development capabilities. Meanwhile, IBIO-101 remains our lead immuno-oncology asset. 
For our Bioprocessing area, the FastPharming System is our proprietary approach to recombinant protein production using plants. It uses hydroponically grown Nicotiana benthamiana (a relative of the tobacco plant), novel expression vectors, and transient transfection at scale to produce complex proteins emerging from our own development pipeline or for our clients. 
In an effort to focus our resources on the promising new AI discovery platform and entering the clinic with our lead compounds, we have initiated a review of potential options to accelerate our transformation into a platform drug discovery and development company while extending our cash runway. These include a review of the pipeline, asset sales or licenses, partnerships, portfolio decisions, cost reductions, and efforts to raise additional capital, including non-dilutive additions of capital.
Biopharmaceuticals:
AI Drug Discovery Platform
In September 2022, iBio purchased substantially all of the assets of RubrYc (for a complete description of the transaction please see Footnote 26—Subsequent Events). The AI Drug Discovery platform technology is designed to be used to discover antibodies that bind to hard-to-target subdominant and conformational epitopes for further development within our existing portfolio or in partnership with outside entities. The RubrYc AI platform is built upon 3 key technologies. 

1. | Epitope Targeting Engine: A proprietary machine-learning platform that combines computational biology and 3D-modeling to identify molecules that mimic hard-to-target binding sites on target proteins, specifically, subdominant and conformational epitopes. The creation of these small mimics enables the engineering of
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

therapeutic antibody candidates that can selectively bind immune and cancer cells better than ”trial and error” antibody engineering and screening methods that are traditionally focused on dominant epitopes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | RubrYcHuTM Library: An AI-generated human antibody library free of significant sequence liabilities that provides a unique pool of antibodies to screen. The combination of the Epitope Targeting Engine and screening with the RubrYcHu Library has been shown to reduce the discovery time from Ideation to in vivo Proof-of-Concept [PoC] by up to 4 months. This has the potential to enable more, and better, therapeutic candidates to reach the clinic, faster.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | StableHuTM Library: An AI-powered sequence optimization library used to improve antibody performance. Once an antibody has been advanced to the Lead Optimization stage, StableHu allows precise and rapid optimization of the antibody binding regions to rapidly move a candidate molecule into the IND-enabling stage.

Therapeutics
Immuno-Oncology
There have been notable advances in the field of oncology in recent years, and arguably none more important than the advent of immunotherapies. The Company has established its own AI drug discovery and drug development capabilities in San Diego, California, has built a pipeline of nine immuno-oncology programs.
IBIO-101
In August 2021, the Company signed a worldwide exclusive licensing agreement with RubrYc to develop and commercialize RTX-003 (now referred to as IBIO-101), an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody [mAb]. As of September 2022, the Company acquired exclusive ownership rights to IBIO-101. In preclinical models of disease, IBIO-101 has demonstrated the ability to bind and deplete immunosuppressive regulatory T [Treg] cells to inhibit the growth of solid tumors. 
​
Targeting depletion of Treg cells to control tumors emerged as an area of interest in oncology over the past several years. Since Treg cells express interleukin-2 Rα (“IL-2Rα” or “CD25”), it was envisioned that mAbs could be developed that bind CD25 and thereby trigger depletion by Natural Killer cells, resulting in stimulation of anti-tumor immunity.
​

2



Unfortunately, while first-generation mAbs successfully bound CD25+ cells, they also interfered with interleukin-2 [IL-2] signaling to T effector [Teff] cells to activate their cancer cell killing effects. The result was a failure of first-gen anti-CD25 mAbs as cancer immunotherapies, since their favorable anti-Treg effects were negated by their unfavorable impact on Teff cells.
​
IBIO-101 is a second-generation anti-CD25 mAb that potently binds and depletes Treg cells but doesn’t block the IL-2 signaling pathway to Teffs. IBIO-101 was initially developed using traditional mammalian cell expression systems, and preclinical studies have demonstrated that fucosylated and afucosylated IBIO-101 produced using a mammalian expression or the FastPharming System and Glycaneering Technology have comparable performance offering 2 potential alternative manufacturing paths.
​
We continue to advance its IL-2 sparing anti-CD25 antibody, IBIO-101, and anticipate moving the program from IND-enabling stage to an IND filing during the calendar year 2024.

​Discovery Immuno-Oncology
With iBio’s existing portfolio and with the acquisition of all of RubrYc’s pipeline assets, iBio has eight assets in the discovery phase for immuno-oncology including three immuno-oncology products in the late discovery stage and five products in the early discovery stage. Two of the late discovery programs have advanced from early to late discovery in June 2022 after extensive screening and in vitro testing. 
All three immune-oncology programs purchased from RubrYc specifically have been selected to be differentiated by or benefit from the different RubrYc technology platforms.
We expect the immuno-oncology pipeline to continue to evolve as we evaluate the combined portfolio, move targets through preclinical stages and add targets via the AI Discovery Platform. 
Autoimmune
PD-1
iBio has purchased the global rights to a partnership-ready PD-1 agonistic mAb intended to treat serious autoimmune disorders. While the goal in immuno-oncology is to remove immune tolerance towards cancer cells, in autoimmune diseases the opposite is the case, because autoimmune diseases can result from deficits in peripheral and/or central tolerance mechanisms which presents an opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Specifically, agonism or stimulation of inhibitory receptors like PD-1 or CTLA4, which mediate peripheral tolerance is a promising approach to treat autoimmune diseases. Unlike PD-1 antagonists used in immuno-oncology, PD-1 agonists are difficult to find. RubrYc used its AI Discovery Platform to discover PD-1. PD-1 is currently in the late-discovery stage, having undergone extensive screening and in vitro characterization, and we anticipate it will be advanced into in vivo models as IBIO-102, in the near future. 
Fibrosis
Fibrosis is a pathological disorder in which connective tissue replaces normal parenchymal tissue to the extent that it goes unchecked, leading to considerable tissue remodeling and the formation of permanent scar tissue. Fibrosis can occur in many tissues within the body, including the lungs (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [“IPF”] and skin (e.g., systemic scleroderma [“SSc’].
IBIO-100
Our lead anti-fibrotic candidate is IBIO-100, and its design is based in part upon work by Dr. Carol Feghali-Bostwick, Professor of Medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina and Vice-Chair of the Scleroderma Foundation. Her initial work was conducted at the University of Pittsburgh, and we have licensed the patents relevant for the continued development of the molecule from the university. 
​
As part of the Company’s review of potential options, we intend to continue to review the data from our research and development efforts and with continued consultation with Dr. Fedhali-Bostwick, determine how to proceed with the development of IBIO-100 in Fibrosis.
​

To align with the Company’s focus on the immuno-oncology pipeline, we intend to continue to pursue the E4 endostatin peptide, from which IBIO-100 is derived, as an oncology target in collaboration with University of Texas Southwestern. 
Infectious Diseases
COVID
Coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19” or “COVID”) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. While most people have mild symptoms, some people develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), possibly precipitated by cytokine dysregulation, multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.
IBIO-202
Produced in iBio’s FastPharming System, IBIO-202 is a subunit vaccine candidate that targets the Nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2. 
​Initial pre-clinical studies of IBIO-202 demonstrated a robust, antigen-specific, memory T-cell response. Immunization data are consistent with that, as a strong, cytotoxic, memory T-cell response was seen, rather than an inflammatory response. As a result, in September 2021, iBio submitted a pre-IND package for IBIO-202 with the intent to move its novel vaccine candidate into the clinic. Following review of its pre- investigational new drug (“IND”) submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in January 2022, the Company conducted an IND-enabling challenge study with IBIO-202. At all 5 selected dose levels IBIO-202 provided no protective effect. This was true for all of the assessed endpoints which included bodyweight, viral load and histopathological evaluation.
​
Based on the data derived from the IND-enabling challenge study, iBio has decided not to move forward with the IND submission in 2023 and will further evaluate next steps with IBIO-202 as part of it the overall evaluation of its pipeline assets.
​
Animal Health: Classical Swine Fever
Classical swine fever (“CSF”) is a contagious, often fatal disease affecting both feral and domesticated pigs. Outbreaks in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America have not only adversely impacted animal health and food security but have also had severe socioeconomic impacts on both the pig industry worldwide and small-scale pig farming. Currently available vaccines can be efficient at triggering rapid animal immune response and protecting swine populations when combined with culling of infected pigs but do not allow the differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA), nor are they approved for use in the U.S. The development of DIVA compatible and efficacious vaccination solutions remains a top priority to prevent the economic impacts of a CSF outbreak including supply disruptions, export restrictions and reduced food security.
IBIO-400
In collaboration with the Institute of Infectious Animal Diseases at Texas A&M University and the Kansas State University, iBio used the FastPharming System to develop a potentially safe and protective DIVA-capable subunit vaccine1.

The antigen is formulated in cost-effective oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants. IBIO-400 studies have shown that after single-dose vaccination, the adjuvanted, plant-made CSF E2 subunit vaccine provides complete protection in challenged pigs and is accompanied by strong virus neutralization antibody responses.
We submitted updated efficacy protocols, manufacturing processes, and validation plans to the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) in February 2022 to enable manufacturing clearance of pre-license lots for study material to licensure. During the USDA’s regulatory review period to evaluate our facility for the production of IBIO-400, we intend to continue to assess the data from our research and development efforts and determine how we will proceed with the development of IBIO-400, as part of our overall evaluation of our pipeline assets.
​
Bioprocess segment
Services:
iBio uses its proprietary FastPharming Expressions System and know how to develop or manufacture recombinant proteins on a contract basis for third parties, as well as to support our own biopharmaceutical development initiatives. Gross revenue for 2022 and 2021 was approximately $2.4 million and $2.4 million respectively, an increase of 1%. iBio’s services now include:

Process Development | Contract development and manufacturing, including: Feasibility assessment and development of manufacturing processes using iBio’s FastPharming Technology for optimized gene expression and purification parameters to meet client specifications for their active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”). Product optimization via iBio’s Glycaneering Services that may be used to enhance the quality and performance of therapeutic proteins with our plant-based glycosylation controls.
​ | ​ 
Manufacturing | Bioproduction using the FastPharming System. 
​ | ​ 
BioAnalytics | Method development and validation, including protein characterization using mass spectrometry. 
​ | ​ 
​ | ​ 

We expect our services business to deliver synergies with our Biopharmaceutical Segment, as in some cases it may allow us to identify in-licensing opportunities. 
​FastPharmingThe FastPharming System is iBio’s proprietary approach to plant-made pharmaceutical and protein production. It uses hydroponically grown, transiently transfected plants, (typically Nicotiana benthamiana, a relative of the tobacco plant), novel expression vectors, a large-scale transient transfection method, and other technologies that can be used to produce complex therapeutic proteins emerging from our own, our clients’ and our potential clients’ pipelines.
The FastPharming System offers several potential advantages versus traditional mammalian cell expression systems, including:

● | Speed: Shorter time-to-clinic with research and clinical-scale quantities of product in weeks versus months
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cost-Effectiveness: No expensive, labor-intensive or costly mammalian cell line development
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Quality: Consistently high-quality recombinant protein production with the ability to enhance potency for some products with powerful glycosylation controls
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Scalability: Each N. benthamiana plant is its own bioreactor, so scale-up issues are avoided by simply growing more plants
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Safety: Since mammalian viruses cannot replicate in plants, FastPharming-produced products avoid many of the risks associated with viral contamination events
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sustainability/Eco-Friendliness: Use of plants for the protein expression process avoids the single-use plastic disposables frequently used in large volumes with mammalian expression systems
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FastPharming System is carried out in iBio’s 130,000 square foot facility in Bryan, Texas. The process begins with planting seeds into an inert matrix for hydroponic cultivation and growth of iBio’s plants indoors under carefully controlled conditions. While the plants grow, FastPharming vectors carrying the genes encoding the desired protein product and plant viral proteins that result in amplification of construct within the plant are developed and produced in a bacterial host (Agrobacterium tumefaciens). Subsequently, the bacterial host is introduced into the leaves of intact plants via an automated vacuum infiltration process. After infiltration, the plants continue growing for about another week, as the target protein accumulates in plant leaves. Leaves are then harvested, homogenized in an extraction buffer and the target protein is purified via traditional methods.

In the FastPharming System, no animal- or human-derived materials are used, decreasing the risk of product contamination with mammalian viruses or prions. In place of animal-origin raw materials, green plants, grown under clean and controlled conditions, provide for the expression of proteins. This portion of the bioprocess uses raw materials readily available to us, decreasing certain supply chain risks. 
By incorporating transient gene expression technology, the FastPharming System can deliver high quality proteins for clinical use without several of the time-consuming steps that competitive mammalian-cell based expression systems require, such as the need to i) isolate a high-producing cell clone from millions of non-productive cells, ii) establish a master cell bank, and iii) grow the clonal cells in a sterile fermenter to start the manufacturing process. These advantages may allow iBio the opportunity to test more pipeline opportunities and generate results quicker than conventional approaches. In addition to saving months of development time associated than traditional production platforms, iBio believes that the use of plants as bioreactors may be more environmentally friendly than mammalian cell culture protein expression systems. Traditional protein expression systems require large volumes of water-for-

injection [WFI] that is energy-intensive to produce. Also, many modern cell culture production systems rely heavily upon single-use plastic consumables for their operations. The combination may contribute to the finding that in 2015, the pharmaceutical industry’s emission intensity was about 55% higher than that of the automotive industry2. In iBio’s process, plants, which fix carbon, are at the heart of the process and the use of disposable plastics is minimized.
​
iBio seeks to continuously improve the FastPharming System via incremental and step changes in process to ensure additional advantages are incorporated as technology changes for bioprocessing.
Strategic Alliances, Collaborations, and Joint Ventures
iBio has formed collaborations and strategic alliances to gain access to funding, capabilities, technical resources and intellectual property to further its development efforts, commercialize its technology and to generate revenues, including through the development and manufacture of products at iBio’s FastPharming Facility.

​
FastPharming Facility Purchase from Eastern Capital Limited 
On November 1, 2021, we purchased the manufacturing facility (the “Facility”) previously operated under a lease from two affiliates of Eastern Capital Limited (the “Eastern Affiliates”). We also acquired the approximate 30% equity interest (after conversion) in iBio CDMO held by the Eastern Affiliates, who became the lessee under the ground lease for the property upon which the Facility is located and terminated the Sublease iBio had entered into with the Eastern Affiliates. As a result, the subsidiary and its intellectual property are now wholly owned by iBio. The total purchase price for the Facility, the termination of the Sublease and other agreements among the parties, and the equity described below is $28,750,000, which was paid $28,000,000 in cash and by the issuance to Bryan Capital Investors LLC, an affiliate of the Eastern Affiliates a five-year warrant to purchase 51,583 post reverse split shares of our common stock at a post reverse split exercise price of $33.25 per share. 
​
In connection with the purchase of the Facility, iBio entered into a Credit Agreement, dated November 1, 2021 (the “Credit Agreement”), with Woodforest National Bank (“Woodforest”) pursuant to which Woodforest provided iBio CDMO a $22,375,000 secured term loan (the “Term Loan”) to purchase the Facility, which Term Loan is evidenced by a Term Note (the “Term Note”). The Term Loan was advanced in full on the closing date.  The Term Loan bears interest at a rate of 3.25%, with higher interest rates upon an event of default, which interest is payable monthly beginning November 5, 2021. Principal on the Term Loan is payable on November 1, 2023, subject to early termination upon events of default. The Term Loan provides that it may be prepaid by iBio CDMO at any time and provides for mandatory prepayment upon certain circumstances. The Term Loan is secured by a lien on all of the assets of iBio CDMO and we guaranteed payments of the obligations owed under the Term Loan.
​
The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default (which are in some cases subject to certain exceptions, thresholds, notice requirements and grace periods), including, but not limited to, nonpayment of principal or interest, failure to perform or observe covenants, breaches of representations and warranties, cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness, certain bankruptcy-related events or proceedings, final monetary judgments or orders and certain change of control events. The Credit Agreement also contain negative covenants which included a prohibition on the incurrence of Debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) except Permitted Debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and Liens (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and termination of the Ground Lease Agreement and affirmative covenants that originally included delivery of audited financial statements within 120 days of the year end without a “going concern” or like qualification. In addition, the Credit Agreement originally provided that the Company must maintain unrestricted cash of no less than $10,000,000.
​
On October 11, 2022, we and Woodforest entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement pursuant to which the Credit Agreement was amended to: (i) include a payment of $5,500,000 of the outstanding principal balance owed under the Credit Agreement on the date of the amendment, (ii) include a payment of $5,100,000 of the outstanding principal balance owed under the Credit Agreement within two (2) business days upon our receipt of such amount owed to us by Fraunhofer as part of our legal settlement with them (see Item 3 – Legal Proceedings for more information), (iii) include principal payments of $250,000 per month in debt amortization for a 6 month period commencing the date of the amendment through March 2023, (iv) include an amendment fee of $22,375 and all costs and expenses, (v) require delivery 

10



of a report detailing cash flow expenditures every two (2) weeks for the period prior to the delivery of the last report and a monthly 12-month forecast (vi) reduce the liquidity covenant in the Guaranty (as defined in the Credit Agreement) from $10 million to $7.5 million with the ability to lower the liquidity covenant to $5.0 million upon the occurrence of a specific milestone in the Credit Agreement, and (vii) change the annual filing requirement solely for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, such that the filing is acceptable with or without a “going concern” designation. In addition, Woodforest cancelled the irrevocable letter of credit issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank upon closing of the amendment.
​

Competition 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products.
We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop based on the use of our technologies.
Our competition in the CDMO market includes a number of full-service contract manufacturers and large pharmaceutical companies offering third-party development and manufacturing services to fill their excess capacity. Large pharmaceutical companies have been seeking to divest portions of their manufacturing capacity, and any such divested businesses may compete with us in the future. In addition, most of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or other resources than we do. Moreover, additional competition may emerge and may, among other things, result in a decrease in the fees paid for our services, which would affect our results of operations and financial condition.

12



While we believe that the potential advantages of our new technologies will enable us to compete effectively against other providers of technology for biologic product development and manufacturing, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through arrangements with large and established companies, and this may reduce the value of our technologies for the purposes of establishing license agreements. In addition, these third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.
We expect to rely upon licensees, collaborators or customers for support in advancing certain of our drug candidates and intend to rely on additional work with our collaborators during our efforts to commercialize our product candidates. Our licensees, collaborators or customers may be conducting multiple product development efforts within the same disease areas that are the subjects of their agreements with us. Agreements with collaborators may not preclude them from pursuing development efforts using a different approach from that which is the subject of our agreement with them. Any of our drug candidates, therefore, may be subject to competition with a drug candidate under development by a customer.
There are currently approved vaccines and therapies for many of the diseases and conditions addressed by the product candidates our clients and collaborators may be developing or manufacturing or in our own pipeline. Technological developments in our field of research and development occur at a rapid rate and we expect competition to intensify as advances in this field are made. We will be required to continue to devote substantial resources and efforts to our research and development activities. 
As a biopharmaceutical company with a focus on cancer therapeutics, we compete with a broad range of companies. At the highest level, our therapeutics can be seen as both a complement and a potential competitor to any oncology therapy, most notably chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biologics and small molecule drugs. Not only do we compete with companies engaged in various cancer treatments including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but we also compete with various companies that have developed or are trying to develop immunology vaccines for the treatment of cancer. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources, large customer bases, broader product lines, sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs with extensive facilities and equipment than we do and have more established reputations as well as global distribution channels. Our most significant competitors, among others, are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly and Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, MedImmune, LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc), Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc., Merck KGaA and Sanofi SA, and more established biotechnology companies such as Genentech, Inc. (a member of the Roche Group), Amgen Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc. and its subsidiary Kite Pharma, Inc., and competing cancer immunotherapy companies such as, Bluebird Bio, Inc., Transgene SA, Bausch Health Companies, Lumos Pharma, Agenus Inc., Aduro Biotech, Inc., Advaxis, Inc., ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd., IMV Inc., Oxford BioMedica plc, Bavarian Nordic A/S, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., as well as tech enabled drug discovery companies such as Recursion, Abcellera Biologics, Inc., Cellarity, BenevolentAI, and others, some of which have substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and human resources than we do. These companies might succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive products more rapidly than we can for our products. In addition, competitors might develop technologies and products that are less expensive, safer or more effective than those being developed by us or that would render our technology obsolete. In addition, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Because our research approach integrates many technologies, it may be difficult for us to remain current with the rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Our competitors may render our technologies obsolete by advancing their existing technological approaches or developing new or different approaches.
Research and Development
Our research and development functions are focused on the creation of new products and services, as well as enhancements to our existing offerings, both of which are necessary to maintain our competitive position. Our research and development activities take place primarily at our facilities in San Diego. iBio has leased lab and office space in San Diego for the purpose of conducting research.

13



Commercialization 
We intend to develop and, if approved by the FDA, to commercialize our product candidates alone or in collaboration with others. We do not intend to further develop all of our product candidates, such as IBIO-202, unless we are able to receive grant funding or funding from a partner or collaborator. We may work in combination with one or more large pharmaceutical partners for certain indications, where specialist capabilities are needed. We may enter into distribution or licensing arrangements for commercialization rights for other regions outside the United States.
Suppliers
We outsource certain functions and supplies to third parties such as Charles River Laboratories, Sartorius, Repligen, Cytiva, and Purolite. While we rely on our outsourcing partners to perform their contracted functions, we are continuing to build internal capabilities. Our suppliers are generally available to meet our demands and supply requirements, but our items are long lead time items that have been exacerbated by the current macro environment due to increased demand. We continue to mitigate the risks through inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when possible. Refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for a description of risks associated with our reliance on suppliers and outsourcing partners.Backlog
Our backlog consists primarily of orders for which we have entered into a Master Services Agreement with an accompanying Statement of Work (“SOW”). Our backlog was approximately $0.3 million as of June 30, 2022. 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Approval Process
All of the vaccine and therapeutic products developed from our technologies will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines are subject to rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and other pre-marketing approval requirements by the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the U.S., various federal, and, in some cases, state statutes and regulations, also govern or impact the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record-keeping and marketing of vaccines and pharmaceutical products. The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory approval, if and when obtained for any of our product candidates, may be limited in scope, which may significantly limit the indicated uses for which our product candidates may be marketed. Further, FDA approved vaccines and drugs are subject to ongoing oversight and discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use, or in their withdrawal from the market.
The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices (“GLP”) and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14




● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices (“GCPs”) and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application or NDA or Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for marketing approval that meets applicable requirements to ensure the continued safety, purity, and potency of the product that is the subject of the NDA or BLA based on results of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product candidates are produced, to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA audit of the pre-clinical trial and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA or licensure of the BLA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Tests
Before any product candidates with potential immunization or therapeutic value may be tested in human subjects, we must satisfy stringent government requirements for preclinical studies. Preclinical testing includes both in vitro and in vivo laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. “In vitro” refers to tests conducted with cells in culture and “in vivo” refers to tests conducted in animals. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. Preclinical testing results obtained from studies in several animal species, as well as data from in vitro studies, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application and are reviewed by the FDA prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. These preclinical data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical trials. In the case of vaccine candidates, animal immunogenicity and immune protection tests must establish a sound scientific basis to believe that the product candidate may be beneficial when administered to humans.
IND
An IND becomes effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA raises concern or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials as outlined in the IND prior to that time. In such an event, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials may proceed. For additional information on the most recent FDA regulations and guidance on vaccine and therapeutic product testing and approval, visit its website at http://www.fda.gov. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to potential safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
Clinical Trails
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that 

15



assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations composing the good clinical practice requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Human clinical trials involving biological products are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into a small number of closely monitored healthy human volunteers and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the targeted disease.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. Clinical trials generally enroll a large number of volunteers and are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects.
Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted. 
Many other countries in which we might choose to develop drugs or run clinical trials have similar rules and regulation. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union or other foreign countries, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.

Overall potential risks:
Although we are still in preclinical stages, we potentially could have some risks associated with commercializing a product. These risks include but are not limited to:

● | NDA/BLA:
--+---------


o | Once clinical trials of a product candidate are completed, FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The NDA or BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data, or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the NDA or BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-Approval Requirements: 

o | Any products for which we receive FDA approvals will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses, known as ‘off-label’ use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirement: 

o | In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for instance the Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the physician payment transparency laws, the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA, as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and similar state laws, each as amended. Once commercialized, we could be liable to ensure full compliance with the law. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

o | Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. This is dictated by third-party payors’ coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. The marketability of any product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Foreign Regulation: 

o | In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17




and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Orphan Drug Act 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the name of the sponsor, identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review or approval process, but does provide certain advantages, such as a waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, fees, enhanced access to FDA staff and potential waiver of pediatric research requirements.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Accelerated Approval
There are a variety of pathways under which applicants may seek expedited approval from FDA, including fast track, breakthrough therapy, priority review and accelerated approval. The FDA accelerated approval program provides for early approval of drugs based on a drug on a clinical trial(s) showing that the drug meets a surrogate or an intermediate clinical endpoint rather than a clinical benefit endpoint. Accelerated approval is possible for drugs for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need. 
A surrogate endpoint used for accelerated approval is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Likewise, an intermediate clinical endpoint is a measure of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on irreversible morbidity and mortality. Because it sometimes can take many years for a drug trial to show a clinical benefit, the use of a surrogate endpoint or an intermediate clinical endpoint can significantly shorten the time required to complete clinical trials and obtain FDA approval.
If a drug receives an accelerated approval, the company that sponsored the application must conduct a post-approval trial to confirm the anticipated clinical benefit. These trials are known as Phase 4 or post-approval confirmatory trials. If the confirmatory trial shows that the drug actually provides a clinical benefit, then the FDA grants traditional approval for the 

18



drug. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. If the confirmatory trial does not show that the drug provides clinical benefit, FDA has regulatory procedures in place that could lead to removing the drug from the market.
Healthcare Regulations and Healthcare Reform
Healthcare regulation and pricing (included drug pricing) is complex, extensive, and dynamic around the world. In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement government pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs. 
We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
We anticipate that current and future U.S. legislative healthcare reforms may result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
U.S. Patent-Term Extension
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our current product candidates or any future product candidate, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch Waxman Act. The Hatch Waxman Act permits extension of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during FDA regulatory review process. Patent term extension, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term extension period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension (and only those patent claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended), and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension. In the future, we may apply for extension of a patent term for our currently owned patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. However, there can be no assurance that the USPTO will grant us any requested patent term extension, either for the length we request or at all.
CDMO Regulatory Requirements
iBio CDMO’s operations are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those of the Environmental Protection Agency and equivalent local and state agencies. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. Any failure to comply with environmental, health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or monetary fines or civil or criminal sanctions, or other future liabilities. iBio CDMO is also subject to laws and regulations governing the destruction and disposal of raw materials and the handling and disposal of regulated material. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning research and development, testing, manufacturing processes, equipment and facilities, including compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”), labeling and distribution, import and export, and 

19



product registration and listing. As a result, our facility is subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as regulatory bodies of other jurisdictions where our customers have marketing approval for their products. 
Certain products manufactured by us involve the use, storage and transportation of toxic and hazardous materials. Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and the maintenance of safe working conditions. We maintain environmental and industrial safety and health compliance programs and training at our facilities. Prevailing legislation tends to hold companies primarily responsible for the proper disposal of their waste even after transfer to third party waste disposal facilities. Other future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us and could subject the handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants at our facilities to more rigorous scrutiny than at present.
These regulatory requirements impact many aspects of our operations, including manufacturing, developing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, import and export and record keeping related to customers’ products. Noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements can result in government refusal to approve facilities for manufacturing products or products for commercialization. 
Human Capital/Employees 
As of June 30, 2022, we had 31 employees in iBio and 85 employees in iBio CDMO, 105 of which are full time employees. Our employees are not represented by any union and are not the subject of a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop, retain and motivate key personnel. Our management and scientific teams possess considerable experience in drug discovery, research and development, manufacturing, clinical and regulatory affairs, and iBio directly benefits from this experience and industry knowledge. 
We anticipate that we will need to identify, attract, train and retain other highly skilled personnel to pursue our development program. Hiring for such personnel is competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or attract, assimilate or retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.
We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Management believes that it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully currently and will need to attract new talent to the organization in order to achieve its plans for growth.
Competitive Pay and Benefits. Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically: 

● | we provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we align our executives’ long-term equity compensation with our shareholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | annual increases and incentive compensation are based on merit, which is communicated to employees at the time of hiring and documented through our talent management process as part of our annual review procedures and upon internal transfer and/or promotion; and

● | commencing January 1, 2018, we established the iBio, Inc. 401(k) Plan. Eligible employees may participate in the 401(k) Plan, whereby they may elect to make elective deferral contributions pursuant to a salary deduction agreement and receive matching contributions upon meeting age and length-of-service requirements. We will make a 100% matching contribution that is not in excess of 5% of an eligible employee’s compensation. In addition, we may make qualified non-elective contributions at our discretion.

Reverse Stock Split
On June 30, 2022, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders at which the stockholders approved a proposal to effect an amendment to the Company's certificate of incorporation, as amended, to implement a reverse stock split at a ratio of one-for-twenty five (1:25). 
On September 22, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors approved the implementation of the reverse stock split at a ratio of one-for-twenty five (1 : 25) shares of the Company's common stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, every twenty five (25) shares of the Company's common stock either issued and outstanding or held by the Company in its treasury immediately prior to the effective time was, automatically and without any action on the part of the respective holders thereof, combined and converted into one (1) share of the Company's common stock. The reverse split also applied to common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Company’s outstanding stock options. The reverse stock split did not affect the par value of the Company’s common stock or the shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue under its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who otherwise were entitled to receive a fractional share in connection with the reverse stock split instead were eligible to receive a cash payment, which was not material in the aggregate, instead of shares. The effective date of the reverse stock split was October 7, 2022. All share and per share amounts of common stock presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the one-for-twenty five reverse stock split.
