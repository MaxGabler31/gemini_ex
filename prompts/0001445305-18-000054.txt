Item 1. Business
Overview
Workiva provides Wdesk, an intuitive cloud platform that modernizes how customers work with business data at thousands of organizations. Wdesk is built on a data management engine, offering controlled collaboration, data connections, granular permissions and a full audit trail. Wdesk helps mitigate risk, improves productivity and gives users confidence in their data-driven decisions. As of December 31, 2017, 3,063 enterprises, including more than 70% of Fortune 500® companies, subscribed to our platform. 
Many organizations throughout the world are required to report business data to a variety of regulators, boards and other stakeholders. However, these organizations often struggle to produce accurate and consistent information and reports because their ever-expanding volume of business data is typically spread across hundreds of different sources and stored in incompatible formats. While many enterprises maintain data in a structured enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, International Data Corporation estimates that more than 90% of the data businesses create is “unstructured,” which is defined as unorganized data that resides outside the realm of the ERP. 
Legacy processes and disconnected software technologies are inefficient at helping users find, understand and report critical and relevant information on a timely basis. Organizations often rely on cumbersome manual processes, large teams, third-party consultants and a variety of point solutions, such as disconnected word-processing documents and spreadsheets, general-purpose collaboration software and email. Exacerbating these challenges is the continued growth in size and complexity of many enterprises, with employees and data spread around the world. The stakes for enterprises are high: reporting incorrect, incomplete or untimely information increases the risks of poor decision-making, legal liability, reputational damage and a weakened competitive position.
By addressing these challenges, Wdesk is changing the way people work. Our scalable, enterprise-grade data engine enables users to collect, aggregate and manage their unstructured and structured data in Wdesk. Numbers, narrative, charts and graphics can be linked inside Wdesk, which becomes an organization’s central repository for critical data or “single source of truth.” With linked data and a full audit trail, managers can trust that Wdesk spreadsheets, word documents, presentations, dashboards and reports are up-to-date and consistent, reducing the risk of reporting incorrect data or taking action based on erroneous information. 
In September 2017, we began offering our customers the ability to connect Wdesk with data in more than 100 cloud and on-premise applications. Integrating enterprise business systems with Wdesk enables customers to connect the datasets they need directly to a central hub of trusted data, with powerful linking, auditability and control features. Wdesk users can combine narrative with their data, which further improves a wide range of financial, regulatory and performance management functions.
With Wdesk serving as a single system of record for critical business data, our customers have more time to perform value-added work by eliminating repetitive, manual and time-consuming tasks imposed by legacy software. Technology features people have come to expect as consumers – speed, access and sharing – are available at work with Wdesk, thereby enabling our customers to become more efficient and flexible, which we believe leads to greater job satisfaction, employee retention and career opportunities. 
Coworkers using Wdesk can create, review and publish data-linked documents and reports with greater control, consistency, accuracy and productivity than ever before. Wdesk enables people to collaborate in the same document at the same time, which improves efficiency and version control. Wdesk is flexible and scalable, so users can easily adapt it to define, automate and change their business processes in real time, which helps our users streamline and modernize legacy processes and methods. 
With data linking in Wdesk, changes are automatically updated in all linked instances – including numbers, text, charts and graphics – throughout a customer’s spreadsheets, word-processing documents, presentation decks and dashboards in our platform. Linking enables data consistency and ensures that collaborators are working with the most current data, which reduces operational costs related to tedious ticking and tying and gives our customers peace of mind that their data and reports are accurate and up-to-date.
Wdesk provides accountability and transparency through a detailed audit trail that tracks every change made by every user over time. A complete record of data provenance and all changes helps our customers mitigate risk, gain insights and make better, data-driven decisions.
With permission controls in Wdesk, administrators can manage access at all levels – down to an individual data point – for each user to create, review and edit data and documents that relate directly to them. This control feature also enables users to grant access to their external auditors, outside counsel and other consultants, which streamlines the review process and reduces expenses.  
Wdesk allows users to work anytime from anywhere with an internet connection, enabling them to:
Create trusted datasets that are linked and aggregated throughout Wdesk documents, spreadsheets, presentations, dashboards and reports. Control access to datasets, reports and workflows throughout the organization and with external stakeholders. Connect Wdesk with data in more than 100 cloud, hosted and on-premise applications.Integrate enterprise business systems with Wdesk to directly connect datasets to a central hub of trusted data, with powerful linking, auditability and control features.Combine narrative with data, further improving a wide range of financial, regulatory and corporate performance management functions.Collaborate among thousands of users in the same document at the same time in a secure, cloud-based platform.Streamline and automate business processes, saving time and resources.Present critical data and reports to internal and external stakeholders.Gain insights with improved transparency of data provenance and collaborators’ changes. Decide with confidence based on trusted data and reports.





Wdesk Technology
Our technology is enterprise grade and developed to perform at scale. Wdesk utilizes Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services, which enable us to scale our compute and storage capacity on demand. We can deploy incremental changes to our customers on a daily basis by employing a continuous delivery process supported by Agile software development methodologies and a proprietary quality assurance process. As a result, all of our customers access the latest version of our platform, and upgrades are applied with minimal disruption to ongoing operations. In addition, in order to keep our customers’ data secure, we have developed advanced data security protocols that augment the standard security of the Google and Amazon cloud services. Our architecture has scalability for global enterprises, as well as advantages in reliability and cloud delivery.
Platform Milestones 
In March 2010, we released our first software solution, which focused on streamlining reporting to the SEC. SEC filings, such as Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and proxy statements, are lengthy and complex documents that require significant collaboration across multiple business functions and external constituents, including auditors and lawyers. Our SEC solution enables customers to automate and improve their regulatory filing process. 
In March 2013, we launched our Wdesk platform to respond to the growing demand from our customers to use Wdesk for work beyond SEC reporting. We have continued to add solutions to the Wdesk platform over time by identifying markets where Wdesk can address a wide range of critical business challenges for our customers. We employ a rigorous process to validate and prioritize new markets based on the number of customers that could benefit from a new solution and our assessment of Wdesk’s ability to address that challenge.
In September 2016, we released enhancements to Wdesk that included: new capabilities to our spreadsheets, making them one of the largest and fastest spreadsheet applications in the cloud; more powerful, dynamic dashboards; advanced testing and workflow capabilities and expanded data relationships for SOX and internal control teams.
In July 2017, we began offering our customers the ability to connect Wdesk with more than 100 cloud and on-premise applications. Integrating enterprise business systems with Wdesk enables customers to directly connect the datasets they need into a central hub of trusted data, with powerful linking, auditability and control features.
Markets and Use Cases
Although our Wdesk platform is used for hundreds of different use cases across public and private companies, state and local governments and universities, we are currently focusing our sales and marketing resources in four areas: 
Finance and accounting, including:SEC (including Section 16 and Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, N-4, N-6 and Form S-1 and related IPO readiness); Canada’s System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR); eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) for both GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) taxonomies; Inline XBRL; investor relations including earnings call scripts and press releases; data collection for financial footnotes; statutory reporting; Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A); Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) and budgeting for state and local governments; financial reporting and planning for universities; Global Reporting Initiative (GRI); capital markets transactions; and investment company compliance.




Audit and internal controls, including:Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), SOX certifications, internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR), evidence management, testing, Model Audit Rule (MAR-SOX), audit management, dashboards, audit risk assessments, planning, legal compliance, policies and procedures and issues management. Risk and compliance, including:Enterprise Risk Management, risk assessments, risk framework, board reporting and a wide range of regulatory reporting, such as Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA), Solvency II, Resolution and Recovery Plans (RRP), Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), and Dodd-Frank Stress Testing (DFAST).Management and performance reporting, including:Board, Board committee and quarterly reporting, C-Suite reporting, strategic business plans, monthly management reports, managing and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), budget and planning, data collection for sales, performance reporting and employee benefit financial statements.
Our success in delivering multiple solutions has created demand from our customers for a broader-based, enterprise-wide Wdesk platform. In response, we have been improving our technology and realigning sales and marketing to capitalize on our growing enterprise-wide opportunities.
Sales and Marketing
We distribute our software and services through field sales, inside sales, and partnership channels. We focus on a “land-and-expand” strategy to acquire new customers and expand our existing customer relationships. We reallocated our sales and marketing resources in 2017 to simplify our account management model and create stronger relationships with our customers through improved coverage. 
In 2017, we continued to add more partners. Our advisory and service partners offer a wider range of domain and functional expertise that broadens the capabilities of Wdesk, bringing scale and support to customers and prospects. Our technology partners enable more data and process integrations to help customers connect critical transactional systems directly to Wdesk, which becomes a central repository of trusted data, with powerful linking, auditability and control features.
Our customer success and professional services teams help our account managers build our existing customer relationships by providing advice on best practices that enable users to harness the full power of our Wdesk platform. We believe our sales strategies position us to build relationships over time as we add new users and solutions and expand our platform across organizations. 
Many of the largest and most demanding enterprises in the world are our customers. We have a broadly diversified customer base; our largest customer represented less than 1% of our revenue in 2017. We believe that we have exceptional customer satisfaction, as evidenced by our subscription and support revenue retention rate of 96.0% (excluding add-on seats) as of December 2017. Our subscription and support revenue retention rate including add-ons was 107.6% at the December 2017 measurement date.
We have experienced high revenue growth since the release of our first solution in March 2010. Our revenue increased from $14.9 million in 2011 to $207.9 million in 2017, representing a 55% compound annual growth rate. We incurred a net loss of $43.4 million in 2015, $44.0 million in 2016 and $44.4 million in 2017. Approximately 81% of our revenue in 2017 was derived from subscription and support fees, with the remainder from professional services. 
Our Industry
Industry Trends are Driving a Fundamental Shift in How Enterprises Collect, Manage, Report and Analyze Critical Business Data.
Data is Widespread and Disconnected. Enterprise data is typically spread across hundreds of different sources and stored in incompatible formats. While many enterprises maintain data in a structured enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, International Data Corporation estimates that more than 90% of the data businesses create is “unstructured,” which is defined as unorganized data that resides outside the realm of the ERP. Organizations often struggle with creating efficient and trusted solutions to harness this data in ways that can support decision-making.
Regulatory Requirements are Continually Changing. Legislation, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, and related regulations continue to drive complex reporting mandates. SOX requires public company CEOs and CFOs to individually certify that their annual and quarterly financial reports are accurate and complete and to assess the effectiveness of their internal controls over financial reporting. Increased scrutiny from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) on audits of management’s assessment of internal controls – and the transition in the framework used for assessing internal controls – is driving public companies to find more efficient and accurate solutions for SOX compliance.
Charged with implementing these legislative mandates and others, governmental agencies such as the SEC, the Canadian Securities Administrators, the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, continue to issue and change regulations that affect existing reporting requirements. Regulators are also implementing new, industry-specific reporting requirements. For example, in recent years insurance companies have been required to produce reports for Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA) and Model Audit Rule, often referred to as MAR-SOX because of its similarity to SOX compliance. 
Use of Machine-Readable Data Is Growing. Regulators are demanding greater use of structured, machine-readable data in companies’ reports. For example, the SEC requires that public companies include “structured financial data” in filed annual and quarterly reports so that an investor can automate extraction of the data the instant it is filed and compare it to performance in past years, information from other companies and industry averages. The SEC implemented its structured data mandate by requiring companies to tag the data in their financial statements using XBRL, which is a royalty-free, international standard designed specifically for digital reporting of financial, performance, risk and compliance information. XBRL provides a unique, machine-readable tag for individual disclosures within business reports. Use of XBRL enables government agencies to automate screening and analysis of filed documents. For example, the SEC Division of Enforcement has integrated the analysis of XBRL data into its investigative processes. In June 2016, the SEC began allowing public companies to submit financial statements using Inline XBRL, a standard that embeds XBRL in the financial statements, thus eliminating the need to file two documents.
We expect the use of non-proprietary data standards, such as XBRL, in the United States to continue to grow. For example, in May 2017,  after a two-year pilot program, U.S. federal agencies began complying with Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) requirement to file electronic federal spending reports using a non-proprietary open data standard. The U.S. Treasury Department and the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) selected XBRL as the non-proprietary data standard to help increase accountability over how federal funds are spent. In addition, Treasury and OMB are required to decide in 2018 whether to require recipients of federal contracts and grants to submit reports to the agencies using XBRL.
We also expect the use of machine-readable data to grow outside the United States, as securities regulators, stock exchanges and taxing authorities in several countries (such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom) already require the filing of XBRL data. The European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA) announced in December 2016 that, beginning January 1, 2020, issuers in the European Union must report their company information to national securities regulators using Inline XBRL. Starting December 15, 2017, all Foreign Private Issuers (FPIs) that file financial statements with the SEC prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards must submit XBRL financial data for fiscal periods ending on or after December 15, 2017. In comparison, U.S. companies reporting under U.S. GAAP have been required to file XBRL financial data since 2009.
Management Oversight is Increasing. Enterprises are under increasing pressure to report a growing amount of information to internal management teams, boards of directors, internal and external auditors and other stakeholders. We believe that data needs to be collected, reported and analyzed more rapidly than ever before. Management teams are increasingly focused on leveraging data to support critical decisions. At the same time, boards of directors are pressing organizations to improve transparency in order to better fulfill their fiduciary duties.
Workforces are Becoming More Geographically Disbursed. Market dynamics and the globalization of enterprises have changed where people work and how they work together. Organizations are becoming increasingly global, with employees geographically distributed to support strategic and business needs. Workforce flexibility initiatives have resulted in more employees working remotely, which has increased the demand for cloud-based enterprise software. 
Consumerization of Enterprise IT. Technical advancements in smart phones, tablets and wireless networks have enabled the proliferation of mobile devices across the enterprise. Enterprise cloud-based solutions are becoming increasingly common and are enabling employees to work from anywhere with an internet connection, often from a mobile device. The rapid advancement of consumer applications, particularly social media, has raised expectations for enterprise technology as employees expect their workplace technology to achieve the same level of functionality, performance and ease of use as the consumer technologies that permeate their daily lives.
Legacy Business Processes and Solutions Are Insufficient for Meeting the Requirements of Modern Enterprises.
For many enterprises, the process of compiling, reporting and analyzing critical data has been manual, repetitive and error-prone. Large enterprises often employ hundreds or even thousands of people to manually collect data with unencrypted emails and create and update rolling versions of draft documents and disconnected spreadsheets. Modern enterprises require a level of collaboration, security and control that we believe outdated business software and point solutions do not deliver. Shortcomings of legacy business processes and solutions include the following:  
Access to resources is restricted. Traditional solutions require employees to be physically present at, or remotely logged into, a machine with the required technology and access permissions. Enterprise remote networks can be plagued by connection and performance challenges. These impediments restrict productivity as employees attempt to complete work at home and while traveling and often lead to unapproved workarounds that may expose sensitive data. 
Collaboration is inefficient and risky. Traditional office software requires one person to work on one version of a presentation or report at one time. This rigidity creates challenges as concurrent versions lead to a tedious and time-consuming reconciliation process. Collaboration requires opening and closing, saving and sending, and communicating outside the document rather than inside the document, all of which adds time to document creation and risk to document integrity. 
Workflows are rigid and serial. Workflows for presentation and report production operate as a series of dependent events, with workers being unable to advance sections they are responsible for while waiting for their turn in the document-production process. Any section completed out of order risks data integrity and has the potential to lengthen – rather than reduce – production timelines. Unanticipated events at any step in the workflow may slow down the entire process.
Dataset creation is highly manual. Traditional dataset creation relies on ad-hoc processes and loosely defined protocols to consolidate a patchwork of disparate data sources with different owners and storage locations across the enterprise. Enterprise databases are typically controlled by IT personnel, requiring additional resources and time to query, access and manipulate data. Compiling the same dataset in future periods often requires the same amount of time as the initial effort as enterprises are unable to leverage prior work to roll forward datasets.
Edits are error prone and lack audit trails. Traditional software does not permit linking references to a single source, so when a change is made it does not flow throughout the document or related documents. The integrity of a group of related presentations and reports is at risk every time a number is edited, and worker productivity is lost in a cycle of implementing edits and reviewing for errors. Traditional solutions do not offer visibility into data provenance or the lineage of changes to a document. Audit trails often consist of unsatisfactory solutions, such as tracked changes, which can be turned off; in-line comments, which are cumbersome to manage; and rolling versions, which lead to inefficient workflows and reconciliation.
Control is limited. With legacy software, multiple versions of a spreadsheet, presentation or report may be stored in numerous locations across an enterprise, making it difficult to control who can review and edit, and even more difficult to adjust these roles as the creation process evolves. 
Wdesk Platform Features
Our Wdesk platform enables enterprises and their employees to modernize inefficient business data processes, thereby reducing risk, improving productivity and giving them more confidence in their data-driven decisions.
Integrated Platform of Software Applications Built on a Data Management Engine. Wdesk comprises proprietary word processing, spreadsheet, presentation and dashboard applications that are integrated and built on a data management engine, offering synchronized data, controlled collaboration, granular permissions and a full audit trail. 
Controlled Collaboration. Our familiar, intuitive platform enables co-workers to collaborate within the same Wdesk document, spreadsheet, presentation or report at the same time from any location with internet access.

Our platform also provides a certification function that allows any Wdesk viewer to attest to the accuracy and completeness of documents and reports and allows administrators to monitor the process with customizable dashboards. 
Digital Paper Trail for SOX and Internal Controls. Internal audit and SOX compliance teams use the Evidence Management feature in Wdesk to digitally embed and annotate evidence in work papers with a complete audit trail, which helps our customers and their auditors better identify, assess and mitigate risks. 
Consumer Product Features at Work. The technology features people have come to expect in their personal lives – speed, access and sharing – are available at work with Wdesk in a familiar interface, which we believe improves productivity and increases employee satisfaction.
Trusted Ecosystem for Critical Business Data. Our platform captures a complete history of a document’s lineage, from the most granular edit to a spreadsheet cell formula to key document milestones. At the same time, Wdesk gives document owners the ability to manage document permissions down to a single section of a document or a single cell of a spreadsheet. The ability to control access and user permissions with this level of granularity enables document owners to respond to evolutions in team composition and collaboration requirements. Ultimately, these robust audit and access control capabilities create transparency, accountability, integrity and confidence in the data-creation and report-generation workflows.
Enterprise Grade and Built for Scale. Our cloud platform allows our customers to implement and rapidly scale users and solutions, often within days, without the need to install and maintain costly infrastructure hardware and software necessary for on-premise deployments.
Secure Architecture. In addition to the physical, operational and infrastructure security protections provided by our technology partners – Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services – we work to protect our customers’ data using enterprise-grade security measures. These measures include static and dynamic multi-factor authentication methods, strong encryption in-transit and at-rest and the adoption of aggressive web technologies, such as HTTP Strict Transport Security and Content Security Policies, to protect customers from the most common threat vectors. Secure coding practices are enforced through pre-production vulnerability scanning. In addition, Wdesk undergoes multiple security assessments each year by our customers and independent security firms. 
Ability to Dynamically Define and Change Business Processes. Wdesk frees users from the confines of traditional business processes by allowing them to dynamically define processes on-demand to support evolving business needs. Wdesk enables multiple users to work in concert, allowing teams to redefine workflows and business processes without the traditional limitations posed by disconnected, legacy software systems. Users can make progress on individual sections at the same time and adapt the workflow as needed to create documents, spreadsheets, presentations and reports. At the same time, managers gain an added level of insight into organizational dependencies, enabling them to reassign workflow and resources to further increase efficiency and reduce operational costs.

Wdesk proficiency often appears in our end users’ resumes and becomes an attractive consideration in promotions within an organization or by recruiters looking for professionals with advanced skills.
Growth Strategy
We continue to add new Wdesk customers as well as add seats at existing customers for a wide range of use cases at public and private companies, state and local governments and universities. In addition, customer demand for a broader-based, enterprise-wide Wdesk platform continues to expand as we improve Wdesk features and capabilities and build our ecosystem of customers and partners. Key elements of our growth strategy include:
Expand Across Enterprises. Our success in delivering multiple solutions has created demand from customers for a broader-based, enterprise-wide Wdesk platform. In response, we have been improving our technology and realigning sales and marketing to capitalize on our growing enterprise-wide opportunities. We believe expansion across enterprises will add seats and revenue and continue to support our high revenue retention rates. However, we expect that enterprise-wide deals will be larger and more complex, which tends to lengthen the sales cycle.
Generate Growth From Existing Customers. Wdesk can exhibit a powerful network effect within an enterprise, meaning that the usefulness of our platform attracts additional users and more data. As more employees in an enterprise use Wdesk, additional opportunities for collaboration and automation drive demand among their colleagues for add-on seats. Expansion within current customers includes adding users for both existing solutions and new use cases. 
Pursue New Customers. Our first software solution enabled customers to streamline and automate their SEC regulatory filing process. In 2013, we began expanding into additional markets that were faced with managing large, complex processes with many contributors and disparate sets of business data. We now sell to new customers in the areas of finance and accounting, risk and compliance, audit and internal controls and performance and management reporting. We intend to continue to build our sales and marketing organization and leverage our brand equity to attract new customers. 
Expand our Ecosystem. We continue to expand our ecosystem of partners, including Business Process Outsourcing and managed service firms, global consultancies providing an array of accounting and advisory services, system integrators, large and and mid-sized Independent Software Vendors (ISV) and IT service providers. Our advisory and service partners offer a wider range of domain and functional expertise that broadens the capabilities of Wdesk, bringing scale and support to customers and prospects. Our technology partners enable more data and process integrations to help customers connect critical 
transactional systems directly to Wdesk, which becomes a central repository of trusted data, with powerful linking, auditability and control features.
Target the “Last Mile of Reporting” Market. Many organizations struggle to produce accurate and consistent data and reports because their business data is typically spread across hundreds of different sources and stored in incompatible formats. Wdesk users can collect, aggregate and manage their unstructured and structured data in an integrated environment. Numbers, narrative, charts and graphics can be linked inside Wdesk, which becomes an organization’s central repository for critical business data. With consistent data and a full audit trail, managers can reduce the risk of reporting incorrect data or taking action based on erroneous information. Wdesk improves accuracy, transparency and supports better data-driven decisions.
Offer More Solutions. We intend to introduce new solutions to continue to meet growing demand for our Wdesk platform. Our close and trusted relationships with our customers are a source for new use cases, features and solutions. We have a disciplined process for tracking, developing and releasing new solutions that are designed to have immediate, broad applicability; a strong value proposition and a high return on investment for both Workiva and our customers. Our advance planning team assesses customer needs, conducts industry-based research and defines new markets. This vetting process involves our sales, product marketing, customer success, professional services, research and development, finance and senior management teams.
Expand Our International Footprint. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated approximately 92% of our revenue in the United States. However, the growth drivers for our solution are similar in other parts of the world, including the need to reduce errors and risk, improve efficiency and respond to complex regulatory requirements. For example, European public companies are subject to regulation similar to SOX, and all Foreign Private Issuers (FPIs) that file financial statements with the SEC prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) must submit their filings with XBRL tagging for fiscal periods ending on or after December 15, 2017. Accordingly, we plan to continue to increase our sales and marketing presence in Europe. 
Continue to Innovate. We believe we are the first technology company to build an integrated platform on a data management engine that provides a secure ecosystem to manage structured and unstructured business data that spans data integrations, data collection and linking, controlled collaboration, process management, streamlined reporting and data-driven decision-making. Our research and development efforts are focused on improving the Wdesk platform for broad use across all of our solutions and use cases. Our development teams deploy incremental changes to our platform for our customers several times each week. We employ a continuous delivery process supported by Agile software development methodologies and a proprietary quality assurance process. 
Our Wdesk Data Platform powers one of the largest and fastest spreadsheet applications in the cloud and improves data relationships for SOX and internal control teams. Our Data Platform offers dynamic dashboards, automates reporting and supports advanced testing and configurable, step-by-step workflows. We plan to continue to provide Wdesk users with even more effective ways to capture, store and connect data and to manage workflow, dashboards, presentations and reports. 
Growth in Non-SEC Use Cases. We believe we have just begun to scratch the surface of several large and growing markets outside of SEC reporting, and therefore, we are continuing to invest in software development, sales and marketing to help Workiva grow. For example, we continue to sell Wdesk for regulated risk, Enterprise Risk Management, audit management, SOX and internal controls, capital markets transactions, and performance and management reporting – where we continue to see substantial opportunities for expansion. 
Wdesk Platform Use Cases
Our Wdesk platform enables customers to collect, link, manage, report and analyze critical business data for a wide range of use cases across public and private companies, state and local governments and universities. In addition, customer demand for a broader-based, enterprise-wide Wdesk platform continues to expand as we improve Wdesk features and capabilities and grow our ecosystem of partners. Our advisory and service partners offer a wider range of domain and functional expertise that broadens the capabilities of Wdesk, bringing scale and support to customers and prospects. Our technology partners enable more data and process integrations to help customers connect critical transactional systems directly to Wdesk, which becomes a central repository of trusted data, with powerful linking, auditability and control features.
Although Wdesk is used for hundreds of different use cases, we currently focus our sales and marketing resources on four areas: 
Finance and Accounting
In the finance and accounting market, we sell Wdesk to public and private companies, state and local governments and universities that use our platform to improve business data processes and create a wide range of documents, spreadsheets, presentations and reports for management, investors, boards, regulators, auditors and other stakeholders. 
SEC Reporting. We developed Wdesk to give customers control over the entire SEC reporting process, from data collection to drafting to embedding supporting documentation to the actual filing with XBRL. Our SEC reporting solution allows our customers to prepare and file all major SEC reports, such as Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, as well as Form S-1 and other registration statements, proxy statements and Section 16 reports. Features tailored to the SEC reporting process include the capability to concurrently create reports in the HTML format required for filing on the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system and the ability to perform XBRL tagging as well as to submit SEC reports with Inline XBRL. Canadian issuers can use Wdesk to draft and file reports on SEDAR. Wdesk also enables customers to create earnings press releases, earnings call scripts, presentations and other investor relations materials with data linked to the corresponding filing. 
Broader Use By Accounting and Finance Teams. Public and private companies, state and local governments and universities must create a vast array of complex financial and managerial reports to better drive real-time business decisions. Wdesk use cases include: Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A), board reporting, quarterly reporting, C-Suite reporting, monthly operation and flash reports; statutory reporting, Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) and budgeting for state and local governments, financial reporting and planning for universities, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), investment company compliance and capital markets transactions.
Audit and Internal Controls
We sell Wdesk to people who work in Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) compliance, SOX certifications, internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR), evidence management, testing, Model Audit Rule (MAR-SOX) for insurance companies, audit management, dashboards, audit risk assessments, planning, legal compliance, policies and procedures and issues management. 
SOX and ICFR. Our customers use Wdesk to increase efficiency in documenting, implementing and assessing ICFR as required by SOX. SOX also requires public company CEOs and CFOs to individually certify that their annual and quarterly financial reports are accurate and complete and to assess the effectiveness of their ICFR. Increased scrutiny from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) on audits of management’s assessment of internal controls – and the transition in the framework used for assessing internal controls – is driving public companies to find more efficient and accurate solutions for SOX compliance. With Wdesk, our customers can collect data from multiple departments, centralize that information in a linked platform, create and track process narratives and 
flows with co-workers and embed evidence in internal audit work papers. We began selling our Wdesk solution to the SOX market in the second quarter of 2014. As of December 31, 2017, more than 600 customers use Wdesk for SOX and internal controls.
Audit Management. We sell to the broad-based audit management market because users in that market often collaborate with colleagues working in SOX and risk across an organization. Audit management, which is a subset of a much larger market that is defined as Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC), extends throughout an organization, organically drawing in Wdesk users from a wide range of departments. Audit management, which includes audit risk assessments, the audit planning process and the internal audit group, faces the same challenges in managing and documenting information from disparate departments. Wdesk allows simultaneous collaboration with control, accountability and documentation of ICFR that is essential to auditors, executives and boards. With Wdesk permission controls, administrators can control access at all levels, down to an individual data point, for each user to create, review and edit data and documents that relate directly to them. This control feature also enables users to grant access to their external auditors and counsel, which further streamlines the review process and reduces expenses. 
Risk and Compliance
Changing regulations and mandates create complexity in risk and compliance reporting, which is often carried out by teams scattered across different departments and geographies within organizations. While we cannot predict future changes that could affect federal regulations, we expect demand for Wdesk to remain strong as a platform for improving transparency, accountability and insight into business and government data.
We market Wdesk to address regulatory compliance risk and enterprise risk. Examples of regulations facing our customers include the Dodd-Frank Act, Basel III, Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). Wdesk regulatory compliance risk use cases include Resolution and Recovery Plans (RRP), Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), and Dodd-Frank Stress Testing (DFAST). Regulators are also implementing new, industry-specific reporting requirements. For example, in recent years insurance companies have been required to produce reports for Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA) in the U.S. and Solvency II in Europe.
With Wdesk, risk management practices can be integrated throughout the organization while maintaining information privacy, audit trails and security resulting in highly efficient and transparent compliance. Therefore, we also sell Wdesk for Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) as a solution for enterprises to identify systemic risks, determine risk probabilities, assess risk magnitude, plan strategic responses and report to boards and other stakeholders. Wdesk also can help business leaders make real-time ERM decisions. 
Performance and Management Reporting
Operations teams across organizations of all sizes typically have to collect, track, manage and report on a wide range of operating metrics to better drive business decisions. Our customers continuously find new use cases across their organizations, including board committee and quarterly reporting, C-Suite reporting, strategic business plans, monthly management reports, managing and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), data collection for domestic sales, performance reporting, and employee benefit financial statements.
Wdesk Platform Technology
Wdesk is the cloud-based, multi-tenant technology platform upon which all Workiva software solutions run. Wdesk is built on the Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services and is composed of proprietary and open-source technologies. Users can access all Wdesk solutions with any standard web browser, mobile web browsers and iPad and Android applications. We believe that the following characteristics comprise our platform’s key competitive advantages:
Easy to Deploy and Configure. The Wdesk platform can usually be deployed within days or weeks for new customers and can be easily configured by the customer for individual employees or entire teams. Because our solutions are browser-based, customers avoid costly, time-intensive deployments typically associated with on-premise enterprise software.
High Performance. The performance of the Wdesk platform has been tested and proven by some of the largest, most demanding enterprises in the world. Our platform is built for organizations of all sizes. The architecture, design, deployment and management of our solutions are focused on enterprise-grade scalability, availability and security. Our underlying code base is continually optimized in order to ensure high performance for our users.
Always On. Our customers are highly dependent on our solutions for their business data management and reporting needs. As a result, Wdesk is designed as an “always on” service. Additionally, constant customer collaboration and development iteration allows us to offer our customers continuous improvements by releasing a new version of Wdesk several times each week. 
Scales Rapidly. Wdesk is designed to support concurrent user sessions within a global enterprise, managing billions of data elements while continuing to deliver rapid processing performance. A number of our customers have reported millions of links to single sources of data, among multiple documents, spreadsheets and presentations, without any noticeable negative effects on performance. Wdesk is designed to support millions of end users as a result of its scalability and our relationship with the Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services.
Secure. Many of the largest enterprises in the world trust us with their most sensitive data. Wdesk employs stringent data security, reliability, integrity and privacy practices. In addition to our regular customer security assessments, we aggressively test the security of our operations by subjecting it to continuous and ongoing penetration and vulnerability testing (manual and automatic, internal and third-party). The quality of our data security efforts is validated by our annual completion of an independent audit process using the SSAE 16 standard. This standard is designed to determine whether a company has internal controls and safeguards that are suitably designed and effectively operating. The annual SSAE 16 examination includes coverage of security controls through performing SOC 1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2 audits.
Research and Development 
Our research and development team is distributed among nine office locations in North America and Europe, including our headquarters in Ames, Iowa. 
Our research and development efforts are focused on improving the Wdesk platform for broad use across all of our solutions. Our development teams can deploy incremental changes to our platform for our customers on a daily basis. We employ a continuous delivery process supported by Agile software development methodologies and a proprietary quality assurance process. Our spending on research and development was $68.2 million in 2017, $57.4 million in 2016, and $50.5 million in 2015. Our investment in research and development has grown due to increased compensation and headcount related to dedicating more resources to developing new features and functionality to our platform to capitalize on the growing demand for enterprise-wide Wdesk deployments.
To ensure new features are intuitive and efficient, each development team has a dedicated user interface designer who is focused on delivering an optimized user experience. Additionally, we continuously test our software code using a combination of quality assurance personnel and a proprietary automated testing suite. We believe our focus on user experience and our rigorous quality assurance culture are key differentiators that contribute to the success of our Wdesk platform.

Our subscription and support revenue retention rate including add-on seats was 107.6% as of the December 2017 measurement date.
Competition
The intensity and nature of our competition varies significantly across our different solutions, as changes in regulation and market trends result in evolving customer requirements and demand for enterprise software. Our primary competitors include: 
Status quo, manual business processes that rely on legacy business software tools;Diversified enterprise software providers;Niche software providers that provide point solutions;Providers of professional services, including consultants and business and financial printers;Governance, risk and compliance software providers; andBusiness intelligence / performance management software providers.
As our market grows, we expect it will attract more highly specialized software vendors as well as larger vendors that may continue to acquire or bundle their products more effectively. 
The principal competitive factors in our market include: product features, reliability, performance and effectiveness; product line breadth, diversity and applicability; product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures; price and total cost of ownership; adherence to industry standards and certifications; strength of sales and marketing efforts; and brand awareness and reputation. We believe that our Wdesk cloud-based platform has the combination of features and value to our customers that will continue to allow us to compete favorably. 
Sales and Marketing
Our “land-and-expand” sales strategy focuses on acquiring new customers and growing our existing customer relationships. We believe that we have penetrated only a small fraction of our market opportunity, and we intend to continue investing in sales and marketing to drive growth. 
Sales
Our sales organization employs a combination of field sales, inside sales and partnership channels. We focus on a “land-and-expand” strategy to acquire new customers and expand our existing customer relationships. We reallocated our sales and marketing resources in 2017 to simplify our account management model and create stronger relationships with our customers through improved coverage. 
In 2017, we continued to expand our ecosystem of partners, including Business Process Outsourcing and managed service firms, global consultancies providing an array of accounting and advisory services, system integrators, large and and mid-sized Independent Software Vendors (ISV) and IT service providers. Our advisory and service partners offer a wider range of domain and functional expertise that broadens the capabilities of Wdesk, bringing scale and support to customers and prospects. Our technology partners enable more data and process integrations to help customers connect critical transactional systems directly to Wdesk, which becomes a central repository of trusted data, with powerful linking, auditability and control features.
Our sales organization comprises sales development representatives, pre-solutions engineers and account managers. Our sales development representatives qualify sales-accepted opportunities for our account managers. Our pre-solutions engineers focus on solutions and custom product demonstrations and consultative sales. Our account managers work to attract new customers as well as expand Wdesk into new use cases and departments across our current customers’ organizations. 
Our customer success and professional services teams also help our account managers grow our existing customer relationships by providing advice and best practices that enable users to harness the full power of Wdesk.
We expect to continue to strengthen our sales coverage in our current markets, as well as expand our sales footprint in locations where we see a demand for our solutions. To achieve this growth, we plan to continue to hire energetic and motivated sales people with experience in large enterprise software sales. We believe that our approach to hiring sales people, along with a progressive training, culture and compensation package will allow us to retain sales talent and continue to drive growth.

Professional Services and Customer Success
We believe our professional services and customer success teams are essential contributors to our long-term success and differentiate our service from our competitors. 
Professional Services. Professional Services include initial setup of documents; XBRL mapping, tagging and review; best practices implementation; and business process consulting. Our XBRL team is primarily composed of people with accounting or financial reporting experience who work with our customers to perform XBRL mapping, tagging and review services. We also employ a team of Solution Architects who offer consulting services to customers to improve and streamline their Wdesk-related business data processes. 
Customer Success. Our Customer Success teams support our users with in-depth knowledge and continuity for each customer’s Wdesk usage. Our Customer Success Managers (CSMs) provide 24/7 live customer support via phone, digital messaging and web-based conferencing. We provide intensive training to our CSMs and segment them for each solution and market focus. We have an in-house, e-learning curriculum called “The Learn Center” for Professional Services and CSMs to continue to develop skills related to Wdesk products, key markets and solution areas, management and compliance. The Learn Center also helps our employees stay current with industry and technology issues. In addition, we pay for employees to maintain professional certifications and licenses that are important to our customers, and we host regular company-wide employee education sessions on business, industry, technology and workplace topics.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual protections in the United States and other jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2017, we had 30 issued patents and 19 patent applications pending in the United States relating to our platform. We cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow or otherwise limit our claims. Any patents issued may be contested, designed around, found unenforceable, or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. We also license software from third parties for integration into our solutions, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available.
We control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, end-customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses, and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade-secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
If we continue to be successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop solutions and services that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our platform infringes their proprietary rights.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the enterprise software industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies, may assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us, and our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify our customers against such claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain solutions or performing certain services, require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing solutions, or force us to pay substantial damages (including enhanced damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights), royalties or other fees. In addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims from third parties. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents, copyrights or other proprietary rights. 
We have registered a number of trademarks and logos, including "Workiva" and "Wdesk," with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in several jurisdictions outside the United States. We have also registered other trademarks in the United States and in other jurisdictions outside the United States. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and we cannot assure you that these names will be available for use in all such jurisdictions.
Litigation
From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of any currently pending legal proceedings to which we are a party will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 1,318 full-time employees. Our headcount as of December 31, 2017 increased 12.5% from our headcount as of December 31, 2016. None of our employees is represented by a labor organization or is a party to any collective bargaining arrangement. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
