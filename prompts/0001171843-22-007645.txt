ITEM 1.         BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
We design, manufacture and distribute fiber protection, fiber management and fiber delivery solutions to enable rapid and cost-effective fiber-fed deployment throughout the broadband service provider space primarily across North America. Our “fiber to anywhere” platform serves the unique requirements of leading incumbent local exchange carriers (“Traditional Carriers”), wireless operators, Multiple Systems Operators and Cable TV companies (“MSO’s”), and competitive local exchange carriers (“Alternative Carriers”), while also catering to the broadband needs of the utility/municipality, enterprise, and data center markets. 
 
We are engaged in global operations. Our operations currently comprise of two reportable segments: the Clearfield Operating Segment, (referred to herein as “Clearfield”) and, since July 26, 2022, the Nestor Cables Operating Segment (referred to herein as “Nestor Cables” or “Nestor”). Prior to July 26, 2022, we were considered to be in a single reporting segment and operating unit structure.
 
On July 26, 2022, we acquired Nestor Cables Ltd, a leading developer and manufacturer of fiber optic cable solutions located in Finland, upon the terms and conditions contained in a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement entered into on May 17, 2022. The purchase of Nestor Cables is expected to provide Clearfield with the ability to vertically integrate the supply of fiber optic cables and help meet customer demand for its products. Nestor Cables’ technical expertise is expected to extend the supply of FieldShield into the North American market to reduce cost and complexity of transportation.

Upon closing of the acquisition of Nestor Cables, the Company reassessed its operating segments as defined under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280, Segment Reporting.  Under ASC 280, operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise where discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”), in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Based upon the Company’s assessment, the Company determined that the business of Nestor Cables was considered a second reportable segment as of July 26, 2022.
 
Nestor Cables Operating Segment
 
As of July 26, 2022, Clearfield through its newly created Finnish subsidiary, Clearfield Finland Ltd, acquired Nestor Cables. Nestor Cables is based in Oulu, Finland, with operations in Keila, Estonia through its wholly -owned subsidiary, Nestor Cables Baltics Ltd. Nestor Cables manufactures fiber optic and copper telecommunication cables and equipment which it distributes to telecommunication operators, network owners, electric companies, building contractors, and industrial companies. Prior to our acquisition, Nestor Cables had been a supplier to Clearfield for over a decade and that relationship continued following the closing of the acquisition. Nestor has two types of production processes, the process of making cable in its Finland facility and the finished assembly portion of its business performed in Estonia. Nestor Cables’ customer base includes telecom operators, network owners, contractors, industries and wholesalers. Products are sold via distributors, and directly to end users. Nestor Cables is subject to Finnish government regulation; Nestor Cables Baltics is subject to Estonian government regulation.
Clearfield Operating Segment
 
Clearfield is focused on providing fiber management, fiber protection, and fiber delivery products that accelerate the turn-up of gigabit speed bandwidth to residential homes, businesses, and network infrastructure in the wireline and wireless access network. We offer a broad portfolio of fiber products that allow service providers to build fiber networks faster, meet service delivery demands, and align build costs with take rates.
 
Clearfield’s products allow its customers to connect twice as many homes in their Fiber to the Home (“FTTH”) builds by using fewer resources in less time. Our products speed up the time to revenue for our service provider customers in Multiple Dwelling Units (“MDUs”) and Multiple Tenant Units (“MTUs”) by reducing the amount of labor and materials needed to provide gigabit service. Our products help make business services more profitable through faster building access, easier reconfiguration and quicker services turn-up. Finally, Clearfield is removing barriers to wireless 4G/5G small cell, Cloud Radio Access Network (“C-RAN”), and distributed antenna system (“DAS”) deployments through better fiber management, test access, and fiber protection.
 
Substantially all of the final build and assembly is completed at Clearfield’s plants in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota and Mexico, with manufacturing support from a network of domestic and global manufacturing partners. Clearfield specializes in producing these products on both a quick-turn and scheduled delivery basis.
 
Products
 
Product development for the Company’s product line program has mainly been conducted internally. We believe that the communication industry environment is constantly evolving, and our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. Our product strategy involves analyzing the environment and technology, with a particular focus on simplifying our customers’ business, and developing innovative high-quality products utilizing modular design wherever possible. Research and development are reflected in Selling, General, & Administrative expenses.
 
Some of our products currently offered are described below:
 
    2 

  

FieldSmart® is a series of panels, cabinets, wall boxes and other enclosures that house the Clearview components to provide a consistent design from the inside plant of the telco’s “central office” or cable television’s “head-end,” all the way through the outside plant to the access network to within the home or business. The central building block of FieldSmart is the patented technology surrounding the Clearview® Cassette.

The Company’s products are sold direct to customers through the Company’s sales force as well as through authorized distributors. In addition, the Company uses manufacturing sales representatives and sales agents for customer and geography specific needs.
 
The Company considers the primary markets for its products to be as follows:
 
FTTP
 Fiber to the Premise (also called Fiber to the Home) is a means of delivering the highest possible level of bandwidth directly to the user. The Company’s sales and marketing efforts have principally been focused on the U.S., with additional efforts in Canada and Central/Latin America.
FTTB
 Fiber to the Business is principally for Multiple System Operators (cable television) and wireless/wireless national telco carriers (Tier 1) to penetrate the business marketplace.
 
FTT-Cell site
 Fiber to the Cell site is the trend in which wireless service providers enhance their coverage for bandwidth. Currently, the majority of these cell sites are served by fiber.
DAS
 A distributed-antenna system, or DAS, is a network of spatially separated antenna nodes connected to a common source via a transport medium that provides wireless service within a geographic area or structure.
C-RAN
 C-RAN uses front-haul fiber to connect the Remote Radio Head (“RRH”) to a Baseband Unit (“BBU”) located in a datacenter (i.e., the cloud). C-RAN is an evolution of RAN cellular architecture that traditionally used fiber to backhaul signals from the BBU at a tower back to the mobile core network.
Build to Print
 In addition to a proprietary product line designed for the broadband service provider marketplace, Clearfield provides contract manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers requiring copper and fiber cable assemblies built to their specification.
Competition
 
The market for the fiber management, fiber protection, and fiber delivery products provided by the Clearfield segment is highly competitive. Competition is largely based on any one or a combination of the following factors: functionality and features, price, product quality, cost and ease of installation, service and support, long-term returns to customers, scalability, product innovation and manufacturing capability.
 
Competitors to the FieldSmart product lines include, but are not limited to, products offered by Corning Cabling Systems, Inc., OFS (Furukawa Electric North America, Inc.), AFL Telecommunications (a subsidiary of Fujikura Ltd.), Fujikura Ltd., Nokia, and CommScope, Inc. Competitors to the CraftSmart product line include products offered by Emerson Network Power, a subsidiary of Vertiv Co., and Charles Industries, Ltd., a subsidiary of Amphenol. Competitors to FieldShield include products offered by PPC Broadband, Inc. In various geographic or vertical markets, there are also several smaller companies with which we compete. Clearfield believes that it has a competitive advantage with customers who can leverage the cost savings the Clearview Cassette can provide and those who require quick-turn, high-performance customized products, and that it is at a competitive disadvantage with customers who principally seek large volume commodity products.

The Nestor Cables segment faces competition from numerous competitors within each of the markets it serves. The Nestor Cables segment competes primarily on the basis of its product performance and its ability to meet its customers’ highly specified design, engineering and delivery needs on a timely basis. The market demand and resulting build rates of fiber optic networks and capital expenditures by telecommunications wholesalers and telecommunications providers, has a large and direct influence on the demand for the Nestor Cables segment products.
 
Many of our competitors have greater resources than we do, including greater sales, product development, marketing, financial, technical, or engineering resources. As a result, our competitors may be able to procure necessary components and labor at much lower prices than we can or may offer competitive products at below market prices, which could prevent us from competing effectively.
 
Sources of Materials and Supply Chain
 
Numerous purchased materials and components, and sources of labor are used in the manufacturing of the Company’s products. Most of these are available from multiple suppliers. However, some components and third-party contract manufacturing services are purchased from a single or a limited number of suppliers. The loss of access to some components and third-party contract manufacturing services could have an adverse effect on our ability to deliver products on a timely basis and on our financial performance.
 
Clearfield’s Mexico facility operates under a Maquiladora arrangement. Under this arrangement, we contract with a company to provide certain personnel and other services at the production facilities in Mexico that complete final build and assembly of a significant portion of Clearfield’s products. Maquiladora also status allows us to import certain items from the United States into Mexico duty-free, provided that such items, after processing, are exported from Mexico within a stipulated time frame.
 
Our supply chain management team oversees our suppliers to source and procure materials, manufacture and deliver our products to customers from the site of manufacture, whether at Clearfield’s facility in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota or the two facilities in Tijuana, Mexico that operate as Maquiladoras. Our supply chain management team consists of planning, sourcing, and logistics personnel. We tightly integrate our supply chain management, our product innovation activities, and our manufacturing operations. Our supply chain team also manages the critical logistics and transport services for our materials, components and finished products in and out of Mexico to ensure sufficient materials to timely produce products and to ensure timely export of products in order to qualify as duty-free.
 
Over the last several years, we have taken steps to improve our supply chain operations, enhance resiliency and mitigate risk of disruption that are described below under “Developments Regarding, and Actions Taken in Response to, COVID-19.”
 
Major Customers and Financial Information about Geographic Areas 
 
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the Company had one customer that comprised 14% of net sales. This customer is a distributor. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, and 2020 the Company had two customers that comprised 28% and 30% of net sales, respectively. Both of these customers were distributors. These major customers, like our other customers, purchase our products from time to time through purchase orders, and we do not have any agreements that obligate these major customers to purchase products in the future from us.
 
As of September 30, 2022, one customer accounted for 20% of accounts receivable. This customer is a distributor. As of September 30, 2021, one customer accounted for 17% of accounts receivable. This customer is a telecommunications service provider in the Company’s Community Broadband market.
 
    5 

  

The Company allocates sales from external customers to geographic areas based on the location to which the product is transported. Sales outside the United States are principally to customers in countries in the Caribbean, Canada, Europe and Central and South America. Since our acquisition of Nestor Cables in July 2022, we have experienced an increased concentration of customers based in Europe.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
As of September 30, 2022, Clearfield has 36 patents granted and multiple patent applications pending both inside and outside the United States. These patents begin to expire in 2028. We have also developed and are using multiple trademarks and logos to market and promote our products.         
Sales Backlog
 
Sales backlog reflects purchase order commitments for our products received from customers that have yet to be fulfilled. The Company had a backlog of $164,914,000, and $66,365,000 as of September 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. At September 30, 2022, most of the Company’s backlog orders are scheduled to ship within the next six months. We believe that the Nestor Cables segment generally experiences the same seasonality as the Clearfield segment.
Seasonality
 
We are affected by the seasonal trends in the industries we serve. We typically experience sequentially lower sales in our first and second fiscal year quarters, primarily due to customer budget cycles, deployment schedules of outdoor products, some customer geographical concentrations as well as standard vacation and holiday calendars. Sales have usually reach a seasonal peak in our third and fourth fiscal quarters.
Human Capital Resources
 
As of September 30, 2022, the Company had approximately 407 full-time employees, of which 70% were based in the United States (“U.S.”) and 30% were based outside of the U.S., primarily in Finland and Estonia due to our Nestor Cables operations. We also employ seasonal, part-time employees and independent contractors. Subject to customarily local collective bargaining arrangements for employees in Finland and Estonia, none of our employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreement.
 
Our U.S. employees include approximately 160 office personnel and 120 manufacturing personnel as of September 30, 2022. The substantial majority of these employees work out of our Brooklyn Park, Minnesota headquarters. The Company’s office personnel are comprised of sales, marketing, engineering, and administrative personnel. The manufacturing personnel include both individuals directly involved in the manufacturing of our products, as well as warehouse and operations supervisory personnel. Certain positions within our organization require industry specific technical knowledge. Our manufacturing personnel currently work in two shifts as needed at our Brooklyn Park facility.
 
We invest significant management attention, time and resources to attract, engage, develop and retain our employees, particularly for positions that require technical knowledge or expertise. For this reason, we offer rigorous training programs for manufacturing and other technical employees to allow them to develop the necessary skillset for their roles and promote career development. To date, our training programs and overall collaborative working environment have allowed us to be successful in attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel for these positions.
 
    6 

  

Nestor Cables has approximately 40 office personnel and 90 manufacturing personnel as of September 30, 2022.
 
As of September 30, 2022, we had contracted for approximately 725 personnel in the Mexico facilities through a Maquiladora agreement and these manufacturing personnel are also currently working in two shifts as needed.
 
In our manufacturing operations, we monitor key metrics and goals based on quality, productivity, and ability to meet shipping promise dates. As a measure of quality, we focus on First Pass Yield (“FPY”), which is calculated as the percentage of product that meets all performance criteria upon first completion from our manufacturing floor and requires no rework. The Company’s target for FPY ranges from 92-99%, depending on key manufacturing steps and the product line being produced. We also measure our On-Time Delivery (“OTD”) which is determined by the Company’s ability to ship product on the date necessary, accounting for standard shipping times, in order to meet the agreed upon delivery date with our customers. The Company’s OTD target is a minimum of 95%. This metric is important as the Company has taken a strategic approach to be able to offer low industry lead times for our customers. The Company incentivizes certain of its personnel based on the metrics.
 
Climate Change
 
Certain government and regulatory bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes relating to climate change. While we do not believe climate-related risks are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition at this time, we are continuing to assess the nature and extent of risk from a changing climate and the potential for increased regulation.
 
The majority of our manufacturing operations calls for compiling raw material and other purchased components from suppliers. As part of our operations, we focus on minimizing scrap and other waste and look to recycle and salvage this scrap wherever possible. Any new regulation of emissions may result in additional costs to our suppliers which may be passed on to us.
 
In addition, the physical impacts of climate change and other natural events, including adverse weather conditions such as heavy or sustained rainfall, flooding, cold weather and snow, can impact deployment schedules of outdoor products and potentially affect demand for our products. Additionally, we may need to take into account the increasing frequency of extreme weather events in the development of our products.
 
The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, changes in weather patterns, drought, rising ocean and temperature levels, earthquakes and the like may impact our manufacturing operations or the manufacturing operations of suppliers of our critical raw materials or components. These types of impacts from climate change may also result in transportation-related supply chain challenges and negatively impact the delivery of raw materials, components or products to or from our facilities. These potential physical effects may increase costs, cause delays or shortages in components required to produce our products or cause delays in the shipment of our products to customers.
 
Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in the Company’s products or facilities and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including GHG emissions, could subject the Company to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs and other compliance requirements which could negatively impact the Company’s reputation, business, capital expenditures, results of operations, and financial position.

Developments Regarding, and Actions Taken in Response to, COVID-19
 
Under U.S. federal and state guidance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Clearfield’s operations are classified as part of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”) critical infrastructure sector and similar categorization in Minnesota. In March 2020, we transitioned our corporate employees at our Brooklyn Park headquarters to remote work arrangements and they currently continue primarily working remote. In accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and World Health Organization (“WHO”) guidelines, we implemented and have continued health and safety measures for the production staff that remain onsite at our Brooklyn Park facility. We have maintained our manufacturing capacity in Brooklyn Park with these personnel at near historic levels. Similarly, we have ensured implementation of the recommended health and safety measures for the production staff that remain onsite at our Tijuana, Mexico manufacturing facilities that operate as Maquiladoras. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has closely monitored the operations and staffing levels at its Brooklyn Park facility and the two manufacturing facilities in Tijuana, Mexico.
 
Due to the risks to timely supply of materials to our facilities, we have taken multiple actions to ensure sufficient safety stock inventory levels at both our Minnesota and Mexico facilities. Additionally, we made the decision to maximize the availability of all product lines at all three of our plants by assuring that each location can manufacture across our broad product portfolio. These actions, combined with our historic practice of dual sourcing most of our components, has positioned us to meet our obligations to customers and to fulfill our sales backlog. However, in the event of serious border restrictions or border delays, continuing or worsening component material shortages, supply chain transportation delays, or other serious disruption in our supply chain, we may experience diminished or temporarily suspended operations, longer lead times than typical for product deliveries, or temporarily suspended product deliveries, which would result in delayed or reduced revenue from the affected orders in production and higher operating costs. In addition, due to the unprecedented lead-times and challenges in the global supply chain, we are working with our customers to place longer lead-time purchase orders to ensure availability of components and materials from our supply chain. Based on current supply chain dynamics, lead times have stretched to 8 to 10 weeks for certain product categories. Over the remainder of calendar 2022 and into 2023, the Company expects to work to manage lead times to more historic levels from receipt of purchase order.
