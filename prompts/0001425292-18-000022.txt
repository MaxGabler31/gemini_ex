Item 1.    Business
Overview
CVR Partners, LP ("CVR Partners," the "Partnership," "we," "us," or "our") is a Delaware limited partnership formed by CVR Energy to own, operate and grow our nitrogen fertilizer business. We produce and distribute nitrogen fertilizer products, which are used by farmers to improve the yield and quality of their crops. Our principal products are UAN and ammonia. All of our products are sold on a wholesale basis. We produce our nitrogen fertilizer products at two manufacturing facilities, which are located in Coffeyville, Kansas and East Dubuque, Illinois.
Our Coffeyville Facility includes a 1,300 ton-per-day capacity ammonia unit, a 3,000 ton-per-day capacity UAN unit, and a gasifier complex having a capacity of 89 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen. Our gasifier is a dual-train facility, with each gasifier able to function independently of the other, thereby providing redundancy and improving our reliability. Strategically located adjacent to CVR Refining’s refinery in Coffeyville, Kansas, our Coffeyville Facility is the only operation in North America that utilizes a petroleum coke, or pet coke, gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer. During the past five years, over 70% of the pet coke consumed by our Coffeyville Facility was produced and supplied by CVR Refining’s Coffeyville, Kansas crude oil refinery. We upgrade the majority of the ammonia we produce at our Coffeyville Facility to higher margin UAN, which has historically commanded a premium price over ammonia. Approximately 88% of our Coffeyville Facility produced ammonia tons were upgraded into UAN in 2017.
Our East Dubuque Facility includes a 1,075 ton-per-day capacity ammonia unit and a 1,100 ton-per-day capacity UAN unit. The facility is located on a bluff above the Mississippi River, with access to the river for loading certain products. The East Dubuque Facility uses natural gas as its primary feedstock. The East Dubuque Facility has the flexibility to significantly vary its product mix. This enables us to upgrade our ammonia production into varying amounts of UAN, nitric acid and liquid and granulated urea each season, depending on market demand, pricing and storage availability. Product sales are heavily weighted toward sales of ammonia and UAN. Approximately 44% of our East Dubuque Facility produced ammonia tons were upgraded to other products in 2017.
CVR Energy, which indirectly owns our general partner and approximately 34% of our outstanding common units, also indirectly owns the general partner and approximately 66% of the outstanding common units of CVR Refining at December 31, 2017. 
We generated net sales of $330.8 million and a net loss of $72.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our total assets balance as of December 31, 2017 was $1,234.3 million.

Organizational Structure and Related Ownership
The following chart illustrates the organizational structure of the Partnership as of the date of this Report.

 Raw Material Supply
Coffeyville Facility
Our Coffeyville Facility was built in 2000 and uses a gasification process to convert pet coke to high purity hydrogen for subsequent conversion to ammonia. Our Coffeyville Facility's pet coke gasification process results in a higher percentage of fixed costs than a natural gas-based fertilizer plant. During the past five years, over 70% of our pet coke requirements on average were supplied by CVR Refining's adjacent crude oil refinery, pursuant to a renewable long-term agreement. Historically we have obtained the remainder of our pet coke requirements from third parties such as other Midwestern refineries or pet coke brokers at spot-prices. We are party to a pet coke supply agreement with HollyFrontier Corporation that ends in December 2018, and we have historically renewed this agreement annually. If necessary, there are other pet coke suppliers. We also purchased some of our hydrogen from CVR Refining's adjacent crude oil refinery pursuant to a long-term agreement. 
The pet coke gasification process is licensed from an affiliate of General Electric Company. The license grants us perpetual rights to use the pet coke gasification process on specified terms and conditions, and the license is fully paid. 
Linde LLC ("Linde") owns, operates, and maintains the air separation plant that provides contract volumes of oxygen, nitrogen, and compressed dry air to our gasifiers. 
East Dubuque Facility
The East Dubuque Facility uses natural gas to produce nitrogen fertilizer. We are able to purchase natural gas at competitive prices due to the plant’s connection to the Northern Natural Gas interstate pipeline system, which is within one mile of the facility, and the ANR Pipeline Company pipeline. The pipelines are connected to Nicor Inc.’s distribution system at the Chicago Citygate receipt point and at the Hampshire interconnect, from which natural gas is transported to the facility. 
Changes in the levels of natural gas prices and market prices of nitrogen-based products can materially affect our financial position and results of operations. Natural gas prices in the United States have experienced significant fluctuations over the last decade, increasing substantially in 2008 and subsequently declining to the current lower levels. From time to time, we enter into forward contracts with fixed delivery prices to purchase portions of our natural gas requirements. As of December 31, 2017, we had commitments to purchase approximately 1.8 million MMBtus of natural gas supply for planned use in our East Dubuque Facility in January and February 2018 at a weighted average rate per MMBtu of approximately $3.20, exclusive of transportation cost.
Distribution, Sales and Marketing
The primary geographic markets for our fertilizer products are Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Texas. We primarily market the UAN products to agricultural customers and ammonia products to agricultural and industrial customers. UAN and ammonia accounted for approximately 67% and 25%, respectively, of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017.
UAN and ammonia are primarily distributed by truck or by railcar. If delivered by truck, products are most commonly sold on a FOB shipping point basis, and freight is normally arranged by the customer. We lease and own a fleet of railcars for use in product delivery, and, if delivered by railcar, our products are most commonly sold on a FOB destination point basis and we typically arrange the freight. Our products leave our Coffeyville Facility either in railcars for destinations located primarily on the Union Pacific Railroad or in trucks for direct shipment to customers. The East Dubuque Facility primarily sells its product to customers located within 200 miles of the facility. In most instances, customers take delivery of nitrogen products at the East Dubuque Facility and arrange and pay to transport them to their final destinations by truck. 
We have the capacity to store approximately 160,000 tons of UAN and 80,000 tons of ammonia. Our storage tanks are located primarily at our two production facilities. Inventories are often allowed to accumulate to allow customers to take delivery to meet the seasonal demand. While we do experience higher sales volumes due to seasonality during the fall and spring application periods, we sell our product to customers throughout the year.
We offer our agricultural products on a spot, forward or prepay basis. We often use forward sales of our fertilizer products to optimize our asset utilization, planning process and production scheduling. These sales are made by offering customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates that we propose. We use this program to varying degrees during the year and between years depending on our view of market conditions. Fixing the selling prices of our products months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment. Cash received as a result of prepayments is recognized as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheet upon receipt, and revenue and resultant net income and EBITDA are recorded as the product is delivered.

Customers
We sell UAN products to retailers and distributors. In addition, we sell ammonia to agricultural and industrial customers. Given the nature of our business, and consistent with industry practice, we do not have long-term minimum purchase contracts with most of our agricultural customers. Some of our industrial sales include long-term purchase contracts.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, the top five customers in the aggregate represented 31% of our net sales. Our top customer on a consolidated basis accounted for approximately 11% of our net sales. While we do have high concentration of customers, we do not believe that the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Our business depends on significant customers, and the loss of significant customers may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions, of this Report for further discussion.
Competition
We have experienced and expect to continue to meet significant levels of competition from current and potential competitors, many of whom have significantly greater financial and other resources. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Nitrogen fertilizer products are global commodities, and we face intense competition from other nitrogen fertilizer producers, of this Report for further discussion.
Competition in our industry is dominated by price considerations. However, during the spring and fall application seasons, farming activities intensify and delivery capacity is a significant competitive factor. We maintain a large fleet of leased and owned railcars and seasonally adjust inventory to enhance our manufacturing and distribution operations.
Our major competitors include CF Industries Holdings, Inc., including its majority owned subsidiary Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P.; Koch Fertilizer Company, LLC; and Nutrien Ltd. (formerly known as Agrium, Inc. and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, Inc.). Domestic competition is intense due to customers' sophisticated buying tendencies and competitor strategies that focus on cost and service. We also encounter competition from producers of fertilizer products manufactured in foreign countries. In certain cases, foreign producers of fertilizer who export to the United States may be subsidized by their respective governments.
Seasonality
Because we primarily sell agricultural commodity products, our business is exposed to seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products in the agricultural industry. In addition, the demand for fertilizers is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers who make planting decisions based largely on the prospective profitability of a harvest. The specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like crop prices, farmers' current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns and the types of crops planted. We typically experience higher pricing in the first half of the calendar year, which we refer to as the planting season, and our pricing tends to be lower during the second half of each calendar year, which we refer to as the fill season. 
Environmental Matters
Our business is subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing the emission and release of hazardous substances into the environment, the treatment and discharge of waste water and the storage, handling, use and transportation of our nitrogen fertilizer products. These laws and regulations, their underlying regulatory requirements and the enforcement thereof impact us by imposing:

• | restrictions on operations or the need to install enhanced or additional controls;


• | the need to obtain and comply with permits and authorizations;


• | liability for the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at current and former facilities (if any) and off-site waste disposal locations; and


• | specifications for the products we market, primarily UAN and ammonia.

Our operations require numerous permits and authorizations. Failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws and regulations generally could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions or a revocation of our permits. In addition, the laws and regulations to which we are subject are often evolving and many of them have become more stringent or have become subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement by federal or state agencies. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs or result in delays or limits to our operations or growth while attempting to obtain required permits.

The principal environmental risks associated with our business are outlined below, with additional details included in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and Note 13 ("Commitments and Contingencies") to Part II, Item 8 of this Report.
The Federal Clean Air Act
The federal Clean Air Act and its implementing regulations, as well as the corresponding state laws and regulations that regulate emissions of pollutants into the air, affect us through the federal Clean Air Act's permitting requirements and emission control requirements relating to specific air pollutants, as well as the requirement to maintain a risk management program to help prevent accidental releases of certain substances. Some or all of the standards promulgated pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act, or any future promulgations of standards, may require the installation of controls or changes to our nitrogen fertilizer facilities in order to comply. If new controls or changes to operations are needed, the costs could be material. These new requirements, other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act, or other presently existing or future environmental regulations could cause us to expend substantial resources to comply and/or permit our facilities to produce products that meet applicable requirements. 
The regulation of air emissions under the federal Clean Air Act requires that we obtain various construction and operating permits and incur capital expenditures for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at our operations. Various regulations specific to our operations have been implemented, such as National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants, New Source Performance Standards and New Source Review. 
Release Reporting
The release of hazardous substances or extremely hazardous substances into the environment is subject to release reporting requirements under federal and state environmental laws. We periodically experience releases of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances from our equipment. Our facilities periodically have excess emission events from flaring and other planned and unplanned startup, shutdown and malfunction events. Such releases are reported to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") and relevant state and local agencies. From time to time, the EPA has conducted inspections and issued information requests to us with respect to our compliance with release reporting requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. If we fail to timely or properly report a release, or if the release violates the law or our permits, it could cause us to become the subject of a governmental enforcement action or third-party claims. Government enforcement or third-party claims relating to releases of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances could result in significant expenditures and liability.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Climate change laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions, of this Report for further discussion of the Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") Emissions regulations. 
Environmental Remediation
As is the case with all companies engaged in similar industries, we face potential exposure from future claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters, including soil and water contamination, personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances that we manufactured, handled, used, stored, transported, spilled, disposed of or released. We cannot assure you that we will not become involved in future proceedings related to our release of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances or that, if we were held responsible for damages in any existing or future proceedings, such costs would be covered by insurance or would not be material.
Environmental Insurance
We are covered by CVR Energy's site pollution legal liability insurance policy. The policy includes business interruption coverage. The policy insures any location owned, leased, rented or operated by the Partnership, including our nitrogen fertilizer facilities. The policy insures certain pollution conditions at, or migrating from, a covered location, certain waste transportation and disposal activities and business interruption.
In addition to the site pollution legal liability insurance policy, we benefit from umbrella and excess casualty insurance policies maintained by CVR Energy. This insurance provides coverage due to named perils for claims involving pollutants where the discharge is sudden and accidental and first commences at a specific day and time during the policy period. 
The site pollution legal liability policy and the pollution coverage provided in the casualty insurance policies are subject to retentions and deductibles and contain discovery requirements, reporting requirements, exclusions, definitions, conditions and limitations that could apply to a particular pollution claim, and there can be no assurance such claim will be adequately insured for all potential damages.

Safety, Health and Security Matters
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act ("OSHA"), and comparable state statutes, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. We also are subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.
We operate a comprehensive safety, health and security program, with participation by employees at all levels of the organization. We have developed comprehensive safety programs aimed at preventing OSHA recordable incidents. Despite our efforts to achieve excellence in our safety and health performance, there can be no assurances that there will not be accidents resulting in injuries or even fatalities. We routinely audit our programs and consider improvements in our management systems.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 304 direct employees. As of December 31, 2017, these employees are covered by health insurance, disability and retirement plans established by CVR Energy. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. 
As of December 31, 2017, the Coffeyville Facility employed 151 of our employees, of whom none were unionized. As of December 31, 2017, the East Dubuque Facility employed 148 of our employees, about 64% of whom were represented by the International Union of United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers under a collective bargaining agreement that expires in October 2019.
We also rely on the services of employees of CVR Energy and its subsidiaries pursuant to a services agreement between us, CVR Energy and our general partner. Additionally, the Partnership's general partner manages the Partnership's operations and activities as specified in the partnership agreement and had 4 employees as of December 31, 2017. For more information on these agreements, see Note 14 ("Related Party Transactions") to Part II. Item 8 of this Report.
