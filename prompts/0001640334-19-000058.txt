("Alipay") collection code system. Alipay is a PRC company. The ownership interest will be acquired through the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Guangzhou Shengjia Trading Co., Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of PRC. However, as disclosed in the 8K submitted on April 30, 2018, Shengjia has replaced its 10% interest in the Alipay payment code business development project (“Alipay Project”), announced on December 7, 2017, with a 30% interest in Renhai’s new China Mobile project. Renhai has recently reached an agreement with China Mobile Communications Corporation (“China Mobile”) whereby Renhai and China Mobile are to sign an agreement appointing Renhai as one of China Mobile’s marketers in promoting China Mobile’s business products for the period from April 1, 2018 to September 30, 2018. This replacement was because there was a change in the PRC regulations and practices that had negatively impacted the financial performance of the Alipay Project
