History
In March 2015, FMC Technologies, Inc., a U.S. Delaware corporation (“FMC Technologies”), and Technip S.A., a French société anonyme (“Technip”), signed an agreement to form an exclusive alliance and to launch Forsys Subsea, a 50/50 joint venture, that would unite the subsea skills and capabilities of two industry leaders. This alliance, which became operational on June 1, 2015, was established to identify new and innovative approaches to the design, delivery, and maintenance of subsea fields.
Forsys Subsea brought the industry’s most-talented subsea professionals together early in operators’ project concept phase with the technical capabilities to design and integrate products, systems, and installation to significantly reduce the cost of subsea field development and enhance overall project economics.
Based on the success of the Forsys Subsea joint venture and its innovative approach to integrated solutions, in May 2016 Technip and FMC Technologies announced that the companies would combine through a merger of equals to create a global subsea leader, TechnipFMC, that would drive change by redefining the production of oil and gas. The business combination was completed on January 16, 2017 (the “Merger”), and on January 17, 2017, TechnipFMC began operating as a unified, combined company trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange (“Euronext Paris”) under the symbol “FTI.” 
In 2017, our first year as a merged company, TechnipFMC secured several project awards as many operators moved forward with final investment decisions for major onshore projects and subsea developments. Several of the subsea awards incorporated the use of our integrated approach to project delivery, validating our unique business model aimed at lowering project costs and accelerating the delivery of initial hydrocarbon production. This was made possible by bringing together the complementary subsea work scopes of the merged companies.
In 2018, TechnipFMC delivered the industry’s first three full-cycle, integrated projects and realized considerable growth in Subsea order inbound, driven in part by its unique integrated offering, iEPCI™ (“iEPCI”). For all of 2019, the value of integrated subsea awards to TechnipFMC more than doubled versus the prior year, representing more than 50% of all Subsea project order inbound. The increase was driven by a wider adoption of the integrated business model, particularly by those clients with whom we have unique alliances. With the industry’s most comprehensive and only truly integrated subsea market offering, we have continued to expand the deepwater opportunity set for our clients.
On August 26, 2019, we announced our intention to separate into two diversified pure-play market leaders - TechnipFMC, focused on subsea and surface hydrocarbon production, and Technip Energies, focused on downstream engineering, procurement, and construction project execution. 
On February 16, 2021, we completed the separation of the Technip Energies business segment. The transaction was structured as a spin-off (the “Spin-off”), which occurred by way of a pro rata dividend (the “Distribution”) to our shareholders of 50.1 percent of the outstanding shares in Technip Energies N.V. Each of our shareholders received one ordinary share of Technip Energies N.V. for every five ordinary shares of TechnipFMC held at 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the record date, February 17, 2021. Immediately following the completion of the Spin-off, we owned 49.9% of the outstanding shares of Technip Energies. During 2021, we sold approximately 75% of the original ownership stake for proceeds of $900.9 million. As of December 31, 2021, we retained 12.2% ownership of Technip Energies’ issued and outstanding share capital. In January 2022, we sold an additional 9.0 million Technip Energies shares for total proceeds of €118.4 million, or $135.1 million. As of February 25, 2022, we retain a direct stake of 12.9 million shares, representing 7.1% of Technip Energies’ issued and outstanding share capital and valued at $155.3 million. 
On January 10, 2022, we announced that following a comprehensive review of the Company’s strategic objectives, we were proceeding with the voluntary delisting of our shares from Euronext Paris. The delisting was completed on February 18, 2022.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Subsea
We are transforming subsea energy production by safely providing innovative solutions that improve economics, enhance performance, and reduce emissions. As a fully-integrated technology and services provider, we continue to drive responsible energy development. 
Our Subsea segment provides integrated design, engineering, procurement, manufacturing, fabrication, installation, and life of field services for subsea systems, subsea field infrastructure, and subsea pipe systems used in oil and gas production and transportation. 
We are an industry leader in front-end engineering and design (“FEED”), subsea production systems (“SPS”), subsea flexible pipe, subsea umbilicals, risers, and flowlines (“SURF”) and subsea robotics. We also have the capability to install these products and related subsea infrastructure using our fleet of highly specialized vessels. By integrating the SPS and SURF work scopes, we are able to drive greater value to our clients through more efficient field layout and execution of the installation campaign. This capability, in conjunction with our strong commercial focus, has enabled the successful market introduction of an integrated subsea business model, iEPCI, which spans a project’s early phase design through life of field services. 
Through integrated FEED studies, or iFEED™ (“iFEED”), we are uniquely positioned to influence project concept and design. Using innovative solutions for field architecture, including standardized configurable equipment, new technologies, digital services, and simplified installation, we can significantly reduce subsea development costs and accelerate time to first production.
iEPCI is our unique, fully integrated approach to designing, managing, and executing subsea projects. By combining complementary skills with innovative technologies, we boost efficiency, lower costs, and accelerate time to first oil and gas for our clients. As the first and only subsea provider to integrate SPS with SURF and a fleet of installation vessels, we successfully created a new market opportunity in 2016 through our iEPCI offering. iEPCI projects are partnerships based on knowledge sharing and mutual trust. Success is based on early engagement and a collaborative, cooperative approach, both internally and with our clients. 
Our first-mover advantage and ability to convert iFEED studies into iEPCI contracts, often as direct awards, creates a unique set of opportunities for us that are not available to our peers. This allows us to deliver a fully integrated – and technologically differentiated – subsea system, and to better manage the complete work scope through a single contracting mechanism and a single interface, yielding meaningful improvements in project economics and time to first oil.
We continue to support our clients following project delivery by offering aftermarket and life of field services. Our wide range of capabilities and solutions, including integrated life of field, or iLOF™ (“iLOF”), allows us to help clients 
increase oil and gas recovery and equipment uptime while reducing overall cost. Our iLOF offering is designed to unlock the full potential of subsea infrastructures during operations by transforming the way subsea services are delivered and proactively addressing the challenges operators face over the life of subsea fields.

Dependence on Key Customers
Generally, our customers in the Subsea segment are major integrated oil companies, national oil companies, and independent exploration and production companies.
We actively pursue alliances with companies that are engaged in the subsea development of oil and natural gas to promote our integrated systems for subsea production. These alliances are typically related to the procurement of subsea production equipment, although some of them are related to EPCI services. Development of subsea fields, particularly in deepwater environments, involves substantial capital investments. Operators have also sought the security of alliances with us to ensure timely and cost-effective delivery of subsea and other energy-related systems that provide integrated solutions to meet their needs.
Our alliances establish important ongoing relationships with our customers. While these alliances do not contractually commit our customers to purchase our systems and services, they have historically led to, and we expect that they would continue to result in, such purchases.
The commitment to our customers goes beyond project delivery, and we nurture these alliances with transparency and collaboration to better understand their needs to ensure customer success.
No single Subsea customer accounted for 10% or more of our 2021 consolidated revenue.
Competition
We are the only fully integrated company that can provide the complete suite of subsea production equipment, umbilicals, and flowlines with the complete portfolio of installation and LOF services, enabling us to develop a subsea field as a single company. We compete with companies that supply some of the components, as well as installation companies. Our competitors include Aker Solutions ASA, Baker Hughes Company (“Baker Hughes”), Dril-Quip, Inc., McDermott International, Inc. (“McDermott”), National Oilwell Varco, Oceaneering International, Inc., Schlumberger, Ltd. (“Schlumberger”), and Subsea 7 S.A.
Seasonality
In the North Sea, winter weather generally subdues drilling activity, reducing vessel utilization and demand for subsea services as certain activities cannot be performed. As a result, the level of offshore activity in our Subsea segment is negatively impacted in the first quarter of each year.
Market Environment
Our Subsea inbound orders in 2021 increased more than 20 percent versus the prior year reflecting the continued offshore market recovery and expansion. Innovative approaches to subsea projects, like our iEPCI solution, have improved project economics, and many offshore discoveries can be developed economically well below today’s crude oil prices. We believe deepwater development is likely to remain a significant part of many of our customers’ portfolios.
As the subsea industry continues to evolve, we have taken actions to further streamline our organization, achieve standardization and reduce cycle times. The rationalization of our global footprint will also further leverage the benefits of our integrated offering. We aim to continuously align our operations with activity levels, while preserving our core capacity in order to deliver current projects in backlog and fulfill future orders.
While still impacted by the pandemic, economic activity improved over the course of 2021. Increased global demand and production curtailments by the OPEC+ countries have resulted in improved oil prices, which in turn support market supply growth. Long-term demand for energy is forecast to rise, and we believe this outlook provides our customers with the confidence to increase investments in new sources of oil and natural gas production.
Strategy
We are transforming subsea energy production by safely providing innovative solutions that improve economics, enhance performance, and reduce emissions.

Surface Technologies
The Surface Technologies segment designs, manufactures, and services products and systems used by companies involved in land and shallow water exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. Our Surface Technologies product families include drilling, stimulation, production, measurement, and services. We manufacture most of our products internally in facilities located worldwide.
Principal Products and Services
Drilling. We provide a full range of drilling and completion systems for both standard and custom engineered applications. The customer base of our drilling and completion offerings is oil and gas exploration and production companies.
Surface Wellheads and Production Trees. Our products are used to control and regulate the flow of crude oil and natural gas from the well. The wellhead is a system of spools and sealing devices from which the entire downhole well string hangs and provides the structural support for surface production trees. Production trees are comprised of valves, actuators and chokes which can be combined into various configurations, depending on customer-specific requirements.
Surface wellheads and production trees are “per-well” systems which are designed for onshore shale, onshore conventional, and offshore shallow water platform applications, and are typically sold directly to exploration and production operators during the drilling and completion phases of the well lifecycle. Our surface wellhead and 
production tree systems are used worldwide, and we are one of the few companies that provide global coverage and a full range of system configurations, including conventional wellheads, Unihead® drill-thru wellheads designed for faster installation and drill-time optimization, and high-pressure, high-temperature (“HPHT”) systems for extreme production applications.
We also provide services associated with our surface wellhead and production tree portfolio, including service personnel and rental tooling for wellhead and production tree installation and life of field repair, refurbishment, and general maintenance. Our wellhead and production tree business relies on our ability to successfully provide the necessary field operations coverage, responsiveness, and reliability to prevent downtime and non-productive time during the drilling and completion phases.
Stimulation and Pressure Pumping. Our iComplete™ (“iComplete”) offering is the first integrated pressure containment kit for the onshore conventional stimulation market. Its CyberFrac™ digital platform reduces manpower in the red zone and enables efficiencies that significantly reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, lower downtime, and eliminate the integration burden for operators.
We are one of the few oilfield service providers that can offer an integrated solution covering the fracturing through flowback phases. iComplete provides our exploration and production customers with an integrated rental and service offering, including fracturing tree and manifold systems, as well as pressure control flowlines, flowback and well testing equipment, and field services.
Fracturing Tree and Manifold Systems. During the completion of a shale well, the well undergoes hydraulic fracturing. During this phase, durable and wear-resistant wellsite equipment is temporarily deployed. Our equipment is designed to sustain the high pressure and highly erosive fracturing fluid which is pumped through the well into the formation.
Our equipment (fracturing tree systems, fracturing valve greasing systems, hydraulic control units, fracturing manifold systems, and rigid and flexible flowlines) is temporarily laid out between the wellhead and the fracturing pump truck during hydraulic fracturing. Exploration and production operators typically rent this equipment directly from us during the hydraulic fracturing activities. Associated with our fracturing equipment rental is fracturing rig-up / rig-down field service personnel as well as oversight and operation of the equipment during the multiple fracturing stages for a shale well.
TechnipFMC’s manifold solutions help increase operational efficiency for a pad site with multiple wells. Our SuperFrac™ manifold provides time savings and pumping efficiencies when stimulating multiple wells on a single pad. The manifolds are installed and connected to multiple trees off the critical path, which allows our customers to fracture more stages per day in a compact footprint and efficiently move operations from one well to another, saving time and money. We also offer conventional and articulating arm manifold trailers, which are used as the connection point between fracturing pump trucks and the fracturing flowline and manifold system.
Our Ground Level Fracturing System is an essential tool for unconventional operators who use simultaneous operations to efficiently run completions in multi-well pads. The innovative system design uses various lengths of trunkline to align the SuperFrac™ manifold and fracturing tree at ground level, which minimizes the number of flowline connections for safer operation. We are a significant supplier of flowline pipework (rigid and flexible) that is used to move the fracturing product from the pump truck, via the manifold, into the fracturing trees.
Pressure Pumping. We design and manufacture equipment used in well completion and stimulation activities by major oilfield service and drilling companies, as well as by oil and gas exploration and production operators directly.
Flexibles. We have been a leading supplier of flexible lines since the 1970s and have successfully introduced our Coflexip® portfolio of flexible solutions for the onshore market. Our PumpFlex™ and WellFlex™ products can be incorporated into most shale operations and are an integral part of our iComplete system.

These offerings are differentiated by our comprehensive portfolio of in-house compact, modular, and digital technologies, and are designed to enhance field project economics and reduce operating expenditures with an integrated system that spans from wellhead to pipeline.
Our iProduction™ system is the first automated integrated production platform for onshore unconventional. Our digital interface enables operators to manage their production operations remotely, leveraging Insitex data-monitoring technology. Our separation portfolio and measurement technologies, combined with our expertise in modularization, enable our customers to achieve first production faster with compact systems which are fully optimized and environmentally conscious.
Flowback and Well Testing Services. After a shale well is hydraulically fractured, the well moves to the flowback phase in which much of the fracturing fluid pumped into the well flows back out through the wellhead and fracturing tree system. This phase lasts until the wellbore flow is adequate for flow through the production facilities downstream of the wellsite. Our flowback and well testing offering includes chokes, desanders, and advanced well testing equipment and related services which are provided to exploration and production operators during the flowback phase. Our Automated Well Testing Package (“AWT™”) is now widely used in North America, enabling operators to remove personnel from processes and its digital package anticipates service. These offerings enable a substantial reduction in downtime and enhanced safety.
Well Control and Integrity Systems. We supply control components and safety systems designed to safely and efficiently run a wellpad, modules on an offshore platform, or a production facility. Our systems are based on standard, field-proven building blocks and designed for minimal maintenance during life of field operations.
Surface Multiphase Meter. Our multiphase meters (“MPMs”) are a collection of technologically advanced innovations that provide a differentiated approach to multiphase measurement. The patented technology in our MPMs offers many unique features that provide a step change in allocation measurement and allows for continuous surveillance of wells across a full range of operating conditions. Our MPMs provide real-time data to a central facility, or our cloud portal, for production reporting and remote notification and system troubleshooting.

•Proven pre-engineered solutions for the jack-up drilling environment;
•Connected products in the field, using one single digital interface; and
•Integrated seamless planning for operations, execution and life of field services.
Acquisitions and Investments
In December 2021, we officially inaugurated our new 56,000 square feet facility in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The facility, comprising two stories and a 13,000 square meter manufacturing space, is part of our continued investment in the Middle East to reinforce our leading position in delivering local solutions that extend asset life and improve project returns. The new facility positions us to respond to the expected increase in activity in the area while strengthening our capabilities, providing a solid platform for us to grow in what is a strategic market for our Surface Technologies business. The new facility will offer a broader range of capabilities and greater value-add in-country, supporting our full portfolio with high technology equipment in the drilling, completion, production, and pressure control sectors. 
Also in December 2021 a 10-year framework agreement for wellheads, trees and associated services by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), our largest-ever Surface Technologies contract. Under the framework agreement, TechnipFMC will further grow in-country talent and expand existing manufacturing, assembly and test capabilities in Abu Dhabi in order to deliver the Company’s complete portfolio of surface wellheads and trees locally.
OTHER BUSINESS INFORMATION RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Capitalizing on Energy Transition
Since our inception as an integrated company in 2017, TechnipFMC has been pursuing innovation to reduce emissions within the conventional energy space. We have also been exploring ways to position ourselves in the energy transition by delivering differentiated solutions and leveraging our core competencies and existing resources. We believe offshore will be the next frontier of the energy transition and are ready to accelerate and grow our contribution. This is the role of our New Energy Ventures.
Our goal is to be a key enabler of the offshore renewables industry. To get there, we will leverage our subsea and surface expertise, our technology know-how, our collaborative and innovative mindset, as well as our demonstrated capabilities in project integration.
We will continue collaborating with energy companies and technology providers to bring to market innovative solutions that are best-suited for offshore applications, while maintaining an asset-light model within our business. Utilizing our expertise in integrated projects, we are able to serve as a system architect, from technology development to project delivery and life of field services. 
As a result of our evolution in the new energies arena, we are further refining our market approach, which we define through three main pillars:
•Greenhouse gas removal;
•Offshore floating renewables; and
•Hydrogen.
Project integration is perhaps TechnipFMC’s strongest point of differentiation. We see strong integration potential across offshore renewable markets. For example, by combining wind and wave, or wind and hydrogen, we could maximize energy generation and efficiency, since the incremental capital expenditure and operational expenditure needed is much lower than a standalone product for the same energy generation. We will approach these new integration opportunities in renewable energies with a new execution model, which is integrated Offshore Novel Energies, or simply iONE™(“iONE”). iONE builds on the success of our iEPCI model in oil and gas, and leverages that experience in the new energy space. By acting as system integrator in a complex and rapidly changing environment, we can play a meaningful role in enabling offshore renewable solutions.
The Pillars
We will begin addressing greenhouse gas removal with carbon transportation and storage, a key enabler of the energy transition. We believe one of the safest and most efficient storage locations for greenhouse gases is offshore, is naturally occurring reservoirs and saline aquifers. Existing equipment developed by our Surface Technologies and Subsea businesses can be leveraged to achieve this aim. Our efforts in this area include:
•Development of our iCTS™ - Integrated Carbon Transportation and Storage System;
•A strategic alliance with Talos Energy to accelerate carbon capture and storage;
•The acquisition of Magma Global, manufacturer of the key gas transportation technologies thermoplastic composite pipe and hybrid flexible pipe; and
•An agreement to commercialize PETRONAS’ unique natural gas processing membrane which reduces emissions of CO2 and hydrogen sulfide by integrating the technology into our onshore and offshore production portfolio.
TechnipFMC aspires to lead the offshore floating renewables industry by leveraging our differentiated technologies, product standardization, and integrated approach. This emerging market is predicted to grow from near zero to an installed base of 30 gigawatts by 2030. Our efforts in this area include:
•A partnership with Magnora ASA, Magnora Offshore Wind, to develop floating offshore wind projects;
•A partnership with Bombora to develop the InSPIRE™ offshore wind and wave power solution;
•A partnership with Floating Power Plant, a renewable energy technology company, for an offshore green hydrogen pilot for the Canary Islands which will leverage Deep Purple™ (see below); and
•A strategic investment in Orbital Marine Power, the world's most powerful floating tidal energy turbine, which we believe to be the most mature tidal technology.
We believe hydrogen will become a crucial carrier for the storage and transportation of energy, as well as bringing reliability, stability, and efficiency to renewable sources. Our strategy covers two areas: green hydrogen produced offshore by the electrolysis of water using renewable energy, and off-grid energy systems delivering renewable, stable power to traditional energy installations and remote islands. Our efforts in this area include:
•Deep Purple™ is our system to provide sustainable offshore renewable energy production by integrating wind energy and hydrogen production and storage;
•A partnership with Energias de Portugal (EDP) and others to develop a new platform for green hydrogen production offshore Portugal; and
•Working with renewable energy provider Statkraft towards a trial of large-scale offshore hydrogen storage at Hardanger Hydrogen Hub.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Our business segments purchase carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and steel castings and forgings from the global marketplace. We typically do not use single source suppliers for the majority of our raw material purchases; however, certain geographic areas of our businesses, or a project or group of projects, may heavily depend on certain suppliers for raw materials or supply of semi-finished goods. We believe the available supplies of raw materials are adequate to meet our needs.
Research and Development
We are engaged in research and development (“R&D”) activities directed toward the improvement of existing products and services, the design of specialized products to meet customer needs, and the development of new products, processes, and services. A large part of our product development spending has focused on the improved design and standardization of our Subsea products to meet our customer needs.
Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property
We own a number of patents, trademarks, and licenses that are cumulatively important to our businesses. As part of our ongoing R&D focus, we seek patents when appropriate for new products, product improvements, and related service innovations. We have approximately 3,800 issued patents and pending patent applications worldwide. Further, we license intellectual property rights to or from third parties. We also own numerous trademarks and trade names and have approximately 410 registrations and pending applications worldwide.
We protect and promote our intellectual property portfolio and take actions we deem appropriate to enforce and defend our intellectual property rights. We do not believe, however, that the loss of any one patent, trademark, or license, or group of related patents, trademarks, or licenses would have a material adverse effect on our overall business.
Segment and Geographic Financial Information
The majority of our consolidated revenue and segment operating profits is generated in markets outside of the United States. Each segment’s revenue is dependent upon worldwide oil and gas exploration, production and petrochemical activity. Financial information about our segments and geographic areas is incorporated herein by reference from Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

HUMAN CAPITAL
People and culture are at the heart of our development strategy. People are our wealth and strength. We are committed to our employees, and our employee guidelines are specified in our Code of Business Conduct, which applies to all employees, regardless of their roles, and no matter where they work.
We believe that all our employees are entitled to fair treatment, courtesy, and respect, wherever they work: in the office, on vessels, on industrial and construction sites, or in client offices. We do not tolerate any form of abuse or harassment, and we will not tolerate any action, conduct, or behavior that is humiliating, intimidating, or hostile.
Furthermore, our hiring and employee development decisions are fair and objective. Employment decisions are based only on relevant qualifications, performance, demonstrated skills, experience, and other job-related factors, with our goal of creating a diverse, tolerant, and inclusive workforce. 
Workforce Overview
Our workforce consists of the following:

 | As of December 31,
 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 
Permanent employees | 19,103 | 19,078 | 21,522
Temporary employees (fixed-term) | 1,507 | 1,054 | 1,637 
Employees on payroll | 20,610 | 20,132 | 23,159
Contracted workforce | 1,392 | 635 | 2,560 
Total workforce | 22,002 | 20,767 | 25,719

Attracting Talent
To position ourselves as an employer of choice, we continued to bring our Employee Value Proposition ("EVP") to life. We encouraged and included more people from our business to share their inspiring experiences and stories that truly reflects the diversity and plurality we have in the company. People from different cultures, generations, gender, races, disabilities and sexual preferences are represented by what they all have in common: inspiring experiences lived at TechnipFMC. We continue to explore how best we can share these experiences with external candidates as well as internally through different channels. A significant effort in 2021 was to improve the candidate experience when accessing our website’s new career page as well as on our internal EVP-dedicated web page. 
The career pages aim to reflect key EVP messages as well as our commitments to Diversity and Inclusion and ESG to attract the right talent to our company.
Our recruitment system is becoming more standardized worldwide to improve the selection process. Global programs are being revised to provide a more dynamic, modern and attractive experience with relevant content. Our onboarding program will be further simplified, with better global alignment and more efficient communication to make the experience of new employees and line managers more efficient and connected. Our graduate program gained more global representation with an increase in participation across our business.
Key performance indicators linked to talent acquisition are now available and accessible to key stakeholders through our internal tracking platform. These include the results of the exit interview, onboarding program and new employees; and evaluation of the selection process.
Developing and Keeping Talent
In 2021, we have further simplified the design and process of identifying key talents that was launched in 2020. We saw an improvement in our Leadership Succession Planning both in terms of depth and representation of underrepresented nationalities and U.S. minorities and gender. We have continued to work on Talking Talents (a process launched in 2020 to identify and support development of our key talents). As of December 31, 2021, we have 14 percent (an increase from 6 percent in 2020) of our employee population identified as flagged talents in our three main Career Pathways: Leadership, Technology and Project Management. This includes our Technical Expertise Program, which was also launched in 2020, where we welcomed new experts in 2021.
Leadership You was introduced in 2021, which provides leadership development opportunities not only for our leaders, but for all of our employees. We have also made other talent development tools available for all employees. Examples include Individual Development Plan, Continuous Multi Source Feedback and Inclusive Leadership Training.
Employee attrition in 2021 was 6.4 percent compared to 2.5 percent in 2020, attributable to a significant extent to the great reshuffle we witnessed across industries globally. Through dedicated efforts focused on key talents we managed to keep attrition rate lower at 5.6 percent.
In 2022, we will further improve our Performance Process and move from annual performance reviews and ratings to continuous feedback and check-ins between employees and managers thereby enabling an environment where our employees will have boundless opportunities to grow, contribute and their best. This will further improve our business and individual performance and focus on people development for our people.
As we continued to manage the ever-changing COVID-19 landscape, we have carried on sharpening our focus on enabling our people to grow, develop and share knowledge. The importance of being able to offer learning and knowledge-sharing opportunities in a digital, 24/7, and global environment has been key to our success. Building on our solid foundations, we delivered impactful courses, initiatives and solutions across all of our business segments, in addition to being particularly focused on leadership, technology and project management. 
Technical Expertise Program
Building on the launch of the global Technical Expertise Program in late 2020, we executed the first-ever application and selection process for the program. It recognizes and rewards employees who have demonstrated technical mastery in their discipline, as well as: 
•Technical impact. whether it is operational performance, product development or project management; 
•People development. by inspiring others, enabling the full potential of people and teams, mentoring, sharing knowledge and expertise, and attracting other technical talent; 
•Business impact. by developing business with existing or new customers, new solutions in existing markets, or new markets altogether; and 
•Industry leadership. through internal and external professional visibility as a thought leader, both individually and as a representative of the Company’s technical leadership. 
The Technical Expertise Program has more than 650 members, who share their knowledge broadly across the Company’s learning ecosystem, using knowledge management platforms such as The Bridge to connect with employees in almost 40 chartered global knowledge-sharing networks. The related knowledge repository, The Well, has more than 4,000 pages, which received in excess of 600,000 visits in 2021. The Well is connected with the Company’s competency management platform and provides direct access to competency-based content. Employees in all regions access these and other knowledge management social learning tools such as an Experts Explain webinar series and Illuminate podcasts to increase their knowledge about business and technical topics, and to share their own knowledge.
Learning and Training
Engagement in the iLearn learning platform has seen a significant rebound in use in 2021, as we continue to embrace our digital transformation. In 2021, there were more than 26,000 pieces of creative and innovative learning content available, with ongoing releases of new and meaningful courses, to support skills development for our employees and enhance their performance in their role. In 2021, 76 percent of our training hours (up from 50 percent in 2020) and 96 percent of our course completions (up from 95 percent in 2020) were done in a digital or virtual environment, which resulted in 15.5 training hours per employee (up from 5.85 hours per employee in 2020). The areas of learning in 2021 were Health, Safety, Environment and Security; Human Resources; Legal; and Personal Effectiveness. 
Promoting Cultural and Ethnic Diversity
We focus on our broad cultural and ethnic diversity, which we constantly promote and develop throughout the Company, through the internationalization of our teams, multicultural programs, and international mobility.
Providing Equal Employment Opportunities
Three of our Foundational Beliefs – integrity, respect, and sustainability – are tangibly embedded in fair employment practices and equal opportunity. The Company’s policy is that our employment decisions related to recruitment, selection, evaluation, compensation, and development, among others, are not influenced by unlawful or unfair discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, age, ethnic origin, nationality, sexual orientation, gender or gender reassignment, marital status, or disability.
It is our policy to encourage and give full and fair consideration to applications for employment from disabled people, and to assist with their training and development in light of their aptitudes and abilities. If an existing employee becomes disabled, it is the Company’s policy wherever practicable to provide continuing employment under our usual terms and conditions, and to provide training, career development, promotion opportunities and a safe work environment based on the requested, reasonable needs to disabled employees to the fullest extent possible.
In December 2021, we celebrated International Day of Persons with Disabilities. We had various initiatives to promote inclusion and respect featuring our colleagues throughout the globe, including:
•Inspiring stories featuring perspectives from leadership, disabled individuals and careers of disabled children;
•Creating awareness of invisible disabilities in a podcast; and
•Virtual iVolunteer event for People & Culture where senior managers recorded holiday greetings for Helping Hands for the Deaf through sign language and many other local events.
Strengthening Social Dialogue
The Company has developed a culture that is based on the values of trust, mutual respect, and dialogue. In accordance with local legislation, regular meetings with trade union-appointed and/or works council representatives are organized for information and/or consultation. The Company’s European Works Council (“EWC”) meets regularly and all of our European entities joined the EWC by the end of 2019. In 2021, the EWC elected its new members, who consist of employee representatives from France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, and the United Kingdom.
Employee Engagement and Well-being
In 2021, we launched our first Company-wide employee engagement survey, with a remarkable 70 percent response rate.
The results were consistent with the oil and gas industry, but certainly have room for improvement. The results achieved and the commitments made by our Executive Leadership Team and business executives illustrate the importance of the survey initiative to the Company. The robust and analytical platform gives all managers the opportunity to work autonomously on their action plans.
We continued to build on the strong foundations we laid in 2020, with the launch of our Well-being program in September 2021, in partnership with our Workplace Options platform, to help all employees be more successful at meeting their responsibilities at home and at work. Among the extensive resources available, we focused on mental health and all of our more than 20,000 people now have access to mental health resources and counselling. During the month of September 2021, webinars and Experts Explain webcasts were made available to stimulate discussion on the topic. As committed by our Chair and CEO in 2020, we annually celebrate the month of October as mental health awareness month with several activities to promote awareness. TechnipFMC also celebrates International Women's Day, PRIDE month and International Women in Engineering Day, among others.
Internal Communication
We have a robust internal communications strategy and support communication channels that ensure that we communicate with our employees in a timely and effective way. The effectiveness of internal communication is continually monitored and adjusted based on a focus group feedback program that reaches multiple levels across the Company. New digital tools help us gauge the effectiveness of our digital communication platforms. Employees are regularly consulted and provided with information on changes and events that may affect them through channels such as regular meetings, employee representatives, and the Company’s intranet site. These consultations and meetings ensure that employees are kept informed of the financial and economic factors affecting the Company’s performance and matters of concern to them. 
Labor Relations and Collective Agreements
We seek to maintain constructive relationships with works councils and trades unions, and to comply with relevant local laws and collective agreements in relation to collective or individual labor relations. The Company also operates through local subsidiaries in many countries, a number of which, including those in France, Germany, and Norway, have legal requirements for works councils, which include employee representatives. We send regular information to all employees to share information about business success, changes to the organizational structure, and any major impact to the business or the Company. The same approach to sharing information and maintaining a regular dialogue with employees exists at a local level through the action of the local communications teams and managers. In countries where employee representatives or works councils are in place, the Company seeks to maintain an effective and regular dialogue. To get the direct feedback of employees, we performed an employee engagement survey globally in 2021. The results have been communicated and actions are being taken in all of our operations to improve employee relations and engagement. Every quarter, all employees receive a direct message from the Chair and CEO about the financial results of the Company and main business information.
