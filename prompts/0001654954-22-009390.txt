UPlus Health, LLC Transaction

On June 18, 2021, we and HBR Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary entered into and closed an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), with UserTech U.S. LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“UPlus”) and UPlus Health, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of UPlus (“UPlus Health”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, HBR Sub, Inc. was merged with and into UPlus Health, with UPlus Health surviving the merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and certain ancillary agreements. UPlus Health is now our Company’s wholly owned subsidiary. UPlus helps companies across multiple industries with continuous innovation and market development through the implementation of its proprietary technology called the U+Method, which is a is a step-by-step product development methodology that focuses on front–loading the risky parts of product development before starting large buildouts (the “U+Method Technology”). UPlus has licensed to UPlus Health the U+Method Technology and related intellectual property for use in the health care and medical services industry (the “Medical Industry”), pursuant to a separate license agreement (the “License Agreement”).

 UPlus and the Company believe that their individual capabilities and expertise could be combined to provide a unique integrated solution to clients in the Medical Industry; and UPlus’ post transaction participation in providing the anticipated integrated solution is set forth in a separate services agreement (the “Services Agreement”). The Company’s post transaction financial metrics plan for UPlus Health and the anticipated integrated solution is set forth in UPlus Health’s financial metrics plan (“Financial Metrics Plan”). UPlus Health is managed by the Company’s current management team.

The consideration for the merger consisted of our Company’s issuance to UPlus of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock and a three-year warrant to purchase 1,400,000 shares of our common stock for $0.50 per share, subject to the Special Adjustments described in the Merger Agreement, which includes UPlus’ right to unwind the merger in the event we fail to meet the Financial Metrics Plan described in the Merger Agreement. As of August 31, 2021, the total purchase price for the acquisition was determined to be $857,990, which consisted of 1,000,000 shares of common stock with a fair value of $500,000 and 1,400,000 stock warrants with a fair value of $357,990. The Company concluded the transaction qualified as an asset acquisition and all such acquisition costs have been capitalized.

Principal Services

We generate revenue by providing consulting services. These services include:


· | management consulting related to sales, marketing, business development and advisory board functions to healthcare organizations 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | financial incentive program services to identify grants, tax credits and other government incentives for companies across a variety of industries including healthcare; and
· | technology consulting and engineering services. 


Our management, board of advisors and board of directors have extensive experience in market expansion strategies, financial analysis, acquisition integration, management consulting and training, healthcare law, corporate law, capital markets, mergers and acquisitions. We believe the combined experience, knowledge, credibility and connections of our people are unique and potentially valuable to prospective clients. As a result, even though we have limited revenues to date, we believe we will successfully execute our business plan. See “Description of Business - Our Competitive Strengths.”

Management consulting services

Our management consulting services are designed to help clients increase revenue, improve overall efficiency of their operations, grow strategically and increase profitability. We provide clients with advice and assistance tailored to address each client’s challenges and opportunities, with a focus on healthcare organizations that face operational and financial changes. We believe that distressed companies respond to challenges by restructuring their business and capital structure, while healthy companies strive to capitalize on opportunities by improving operations, reducing costs and maximizing revenue. Many organizations have limited resources dedicated to respond effectively to challenges and opportunities. As a result, we believe many organizations seek to supplement their internal resources with experienced independent consultants like us.

As part of our management consulting services, we perform an initial review of a prospective clients relevant financial, tax and business documentation at no cost to determine areas for potential corporate improvement and growth opportunities.

We charge clients a fee for our management consulting services based on time (e.g., hourly or monthly) or based on a percentage of cost savings or incremental revenue (e.g., revenue or cost savings). As of the date of this report on Form 10-K, we have acquired one customer who has contracted with us to market its services in exchange for a performance-based fee equal to 50% of any fee collected by this customer from business referred by our Company to this customer. We cannot estimate the value of the fee or fees we may obtain from this engagement, if any. This customer presently provides our Company with our sole source of management consulting revenue.

As of the date of this report on Form 10-K, we have generated limited management and consulting services revenue. We cannot assure you that we will ever generate enough management consulting revenue to sustain our operations.

Financial incentive program services

Our financial incentive program services are designed to identify grants, tax credits and other government incentives for companies across a variety of industries including healthcare. We assist with advising on and documenting business processes related to such credits and rebates and work with certified public accounting firms and business owners to compile reports and documentation required to apply for various financial incentive programs.

As part of our financial incentive program services, we perform an initial review of a prospective client’s relevant financial, tax and business documentation at no cost to determine the potential economic benefits from various federal and state incentive programs.

We charge clients a fee primarily based on the economic benefit we facilitate from any incentive programs, when permitted by any applicable rules and guidelines. Where contingency fees are not permissible, fixed fee contracts may be used. As part of our incentive program services, we may be at risk for certain third-party accounting, legal and consulting fees until such time as we are reimbursed by our client, if ever.

As of the date of this report on Form 10-K, we have no customers enrolled in our financial incentive program services; but we have multiple consulting opportunities in various stages of active review by potential customers. We cannot assure you that any of these potential customers will engage our Company for services. Further, we cannot assure you that we will ever generate enough financial incentive program revenue to sustain our Company’s operations.

Technology consulting and engineering services

Our technology consulting and engineering services include digital strategy, design, development, and management services, with expertise in enterprise software, mobile and web-based application solutions. These services are designed to help clients speed innovation, expand market share, drive revenue, and encourage patient satisfaction and population health.

As part of our technology consulting and engineering services, we perform an initial review of a prospective clients' challenges and relevant technologies to determine areas for potential improvement and growth opportunities. We charge clients a fee for our technology consulting and engineering services based on the project.

We implement the U+Method as our step-by-step product development methodology that focuses on front–loading the risky parts of product development before starting large build–outs. The U+Method enables us to determine whether and where a product fits in the market, create a learning organization to continue iterations, and, ultimately, drive profitability:

We cannot assure you that we will ever generate enough revenue to sustain our operations.

Strategy

The key elements of our business model and growth strategy are as follows:


1. | Attract highly qualified advisors and consultants. We believe performance-based compensation, including stock option plan participation, will enable us to attract top talent. Presently, we engage independent advisors and consultants to minimize our fixed operating expenses. We have entered into advisory board agreements with advisors who have healthcare industry experience in market expansion strategies, financial analysis, acquisition integration, management consulting and training, healthcare law, corporate law, capital markets, mergers and acquisitions.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Grow our network of potential clients. We hope to continue to grow our network of healthcare and other organizations that could benefit from our services. To be successful, we must establish and strengthen the awareness of our brand. We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand recognition is an important aspect of our efforts to generate revenue. Presently, we promote awareness of our services through public relations efforts, social media outreach, Internet marketing and business development partnerships. Our goal is to attract healthcare and other organizations who are primarily interested in growing their business through sales, marketing and business development. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Pursue strategic acquisitions. We evaluate select acquisitions of complementary businesses as another means to broaden the scope of our capabilities and our client base. For example, we are interested in acquiring companies that provide consulting, training, education, marketing, audits, cost recovery, group purchasing, compliance, certification, security, information technology and other non-clinical healthcare business services. We believe strategic acquisitions can enable us to scale our revenue with less business risk. Any future acquisition may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us and we may have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership. Acquisitions may also disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing

We presently identify prospective management consulting and financial incentive program opportunities through personal and professional relationships of our CEO Stephen Epstein. We may pay for online advertisements and may enter into third-party marketing agreements to expand our reach.

We also hope to position ourselves as an opinion leader in the field through the creation of media and content; podcasts, articles, essays and other such materials to build good PR for the business and attract interest for our various consulting and advisory services. This includes possibly exhibiting and speaking at conferences and advertising in trade journals, associations, etc. We may generate referral and word-of-mouth programs to drive interest for services.

Our marketing budget is subject to several factors, including our results of operations and cash flow. If our results of operations exceed our expectations over the next twelve months, we should be able to increase significantly our marketing budget, which could enable us to increase revenues. At present, there is no direct correlation between revenues and marketing expenses.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive industry. The market for our services is competitive and rapidly changing, and the barriers to entry are relatively low. We experience competition from large established businesses possessing large, existing customer bases, substantial financial resources and established distribution channels. We expect competition to persist and intensify in the future. Competition could result in reduced sales, reduced margins or the failure of our services to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business and our operating results could be harmed. Our principal competitors include any entity or individual providing consulting services, but not limited to business consultants, growth consultants, sales consultants, marketing consultants, distribution consultants and financial consultants.

Our current and potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their offerings. Our current and potential competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have. If we are unable to compete with such companies, the demand for our offering could substantially decline. 

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe our competitive strength comes from our people, our approach to business and our business model.


1. | Our people: Our management, board of advisors and board of directors have extensive experience and relationships in market expansion strategies, financial analysis, acquisition integration, management consulting and training, healthcare law, corporate law, capital markets, mergers and acquisitions. We believe the combined experience, knowledge, credibility and connections of our people are unique and potentially valuable to prospective clients.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Our business approach: We believe that the best business relationships provide tangible benefits to each party. A central tenet of our business approach is to ensure that we can provide significant value to a prospective client before entering into any services agreement. To understand the scope of a potential engagement and ensure we can satisfy the prospective clients’ primary objectives of any engagement, we are willing and able to spend time with their management team, on a completely complimentary basis, to discuss challenges and opportunities and perform an initial review of their relevant financial, tax and business circumstances. We believe the business approach of investing time and effort upfront and before any service engagement, helps establish trust and credibility, while enabling us and the prospective client to better determine if and how we can add value before entering into any agreement.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Our business model: Aside from the traditional management consulting services model where compensation is based on an hourly or monthly fee, our business model supports the engagement with clients on a performance basis. We believe that offering select clients the option to compensate us based entirely on the tangible value we provide is uncommon in our field and may enable us to attract and retain clients in competitive scenarios.

Technology

We currently use off the shelf technology to operate our business.

Regulation of our Business

We are not currently subject to direct regulation by any governmental agency other than laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses. We are subject to common business, tax and regulations pertaining to the operation of our business. We believe that compliance of governmental regulations will be additional responsibilities of our management.
Employees

We have one full-time employee and one part-time subcontracted accountant in the United States. From time to time, we expect to employ additional independent contractors as well as legal, accounting and other specialized professionals to support our sales, marketing, business development and administrative needs.

Our success will depend on our ability to hire and retain additional qualified marketing, sales, technical and other personnel. Qualified personnel are in high demand. We face considerable competition from other management consulting service firms for these personnel, many of which have significantly greater resources than we have.

Properties

Our corporate headquarters is in Nashville, Tennessee. Substantially all our operating activities are conducted from 400 square feet of office space provided by our CEO at no charge. We believe that additional space may be required as our business expands and believe that we can obtain suitable space as needed.

Legal proceedings

We may from time to time be involved in routine legal matters incidental to our business; however, we are currently not involved in any litigation, nor are we aware of any threatened or impending litigation.
