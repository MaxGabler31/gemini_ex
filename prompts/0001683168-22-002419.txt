ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
Tribal Rides International Corp., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”, “we”, or “us”), was incorporated on May 19, 2014 as “Trimax Consulting, Inc.” On May 8, 2017, we changed our name to “Xinda International Corp.”
 
From incorporation through January 2020, we were principally engaged in the business of marketing an array of property tax lien services including (a) identifying property tax lien auctions and property tax liens for sale; (b) providing valuation services with regards to real property subject to property tax liens; and (c) providing consultative and advisory services to property tax lien investors in regards to purchasing property tax liens, servicing property tax liens and adjudicating property tax liens.
 
On January 18, 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Tribal Rides, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Tribal Rides”), pursuant to which we purchased certain assets of Tribal Rides in exchange for the issuance of 25,000,000 shares of our Common Stock. On February 24, 2021, we changed our name to “Tribal Rides International Corp.”
 
After the asset purchase, we are now engaged in a business that is in the research and development stage of disrupting current ride-sharing paradigms. We are a transportation technology company creating the future of personal mobility with a unique, patented focus on autonomous vehicles. We believe that the mobility ecosystem and marketplace we are creating, based upon our innovative patent and patent-pending technologies, will enable us to address current ridesharing demands and those of the rapidly emerging autonomous vehicle personal mobility market. We are focused on having a significant impact in the emerging self-driving car marketplace.
 
Our Principal Products or Services and Markets
 
We are developing a cloud-based Systems as a Solution (“SaaS”) interface for a comprehensive social network and mobile application. Our planned E-commerce module will enable users to create and manage their own highly personalized transportation experience; to form and/or join groups; collaborate on cost-saving strategies; find, schedule, obtain transportation services from within the groups in which they belong, and easily and securely conduct financial transactions.
 
We believe that the approximately 10-14 million shared-ride drivers in the United States are possible customers for our SaaS services and software and they too may be able to move forward with the autonomous vehicles and their expanded scope of services.
 
Autonomous Driving Vehicle Global Market:
 
Autonomous vehicles are slowly gaining market share. While in 2019, there were some 31 million vehicles with at least some level of automation in operation worldwide, that number is expected to surpass 54 million in 2024. Correspondingly, the global autonomous car market is projected to grow as well. Although the market shrank by around 3% in 2020 due to the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, it is forecast that between 2020 and 2023, the market will grow by almost 60%.[1]
 
Some estimate that the autonomous vehicle industry is expected to generate global revenue of $173 billion in the next three years and autonomous ride-sharing is widely seen as the next big step for the industry. The development of autonomous vehicles is set to generate global revenue of $173 billion dollars by 2023 with the ride-sharing market playing a primary role in the development and marketing of the technology.[2] The industry is forecasted to be $2.195 billion in 2030.

Shared-Ride and Taxi Market (UBER/Lyft/Didi, etc.) (Domestic)
 

· | $117 billion forecasted for 2021. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | $220 billion forecasted by 2025; CAGR of 20.2%. 
· | Smartphone penetration into the market is the key to industry businesses’ success. 
· | A quarter of the U.S. population uses ride-sharing for transport at least once a month.
· | There are great differences between drivers in different segments of the industry. 

 
Shared-Ride and Taxi Market (UBER/Lyft/Didi, etc.) (International)
 

· | The global ride share market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 16.6% during the forecast period, from an estimated $85.8 billion in 2021 to $185.1 billion by 2026. Ride sharing services were the most preferred services before the pandemic, as they offered a convenient and cost-effective means of personal mobility with the help of a transportation network system.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The autonomous vehicle market is projected to be approximately 15+ times that of the Shared-Ride and Taxi Market by 2030.[3],[4] 

Environmental, Social and Governance
 
The world’s cities are expanding with a resulting suburban daily automobile commute that is un-scalable and over-crowding infrastructure. The average commuter spends nearly as much annually on vehicles, their maintenance and fuel as they do on housing. We believe that this is proving to be unsustainable both fiscally and environmentally.
 
While electric vehicles reduce some of the environmental burden, they do not improve our clogged roadways nor greatly reduce the cost burden of vehicle ownership. We believe the emergence of self-driving cars enhanced by our Unified Transportation Ecosystem and Marketplace will bring another wave of societal and environmental transformation, making carpooling safer, optimized and convenient resulting in fewer vehicles on the road, and a corresponding reduction in congestion and damaging emissions. Furthering this benefit, we believe that our patented “Anticipatory Deployment” algorithms will help anticipate demand and may deploy cars in a more optimized and efficient manner than current methods.
 
We also believe that creating, developing and rewarding a cooperative community of users, developers and vendors through ownership stock grants will inspire loyalty to our platform, create a priority of use and commitment, and will provide for financial advancement while reducing the costs of vehicle use and ownership.
 
Distribution
 
We are developing a cloud-based SaaS shared-ride application and interface for a comprehensive social network and mobile application for both Drivers and Riders.

Our current plans are to release our Driver and Rider applications in three phases.
 
Phase 1 (February 2022): The first phase was the release of a Minimum Viable Product (“MVP”) for both approved drivers and riders which included GPS, routing, financial transaction capabilities, rider/driver selections and reservation, fixed fee and variable route costs, and will have various payment options. Although extremely functional, it will not include many planned, patent-pending and more complex algorithms. Both Driver and Rider applications were released on Apple and Android Operating systems and are available on the associated “stores.” Although both applications can be downloaded, only drivers approved by us will be able to participate in this first phase roll-out and only those located in Southern California. Our plan is to continuously update both applications with more of these feature enhancements and “bug fixes.”
 
Phase 2 (2nd Quarter 2022): Once the applications are “hardened” and additional feature sets incorporated, we will be releasing and encouraging new Drivers and Riders to use our applications within our Unified Transportation Ecosystem. Phase 2 will enable us to scale the application and transactions, better understand the driver and rider preferences, enhance the application, incorporate additional patent and patent-pending technologies, and to plan on additional transportation alternatives.
 
Phase 3: provides a stable and enhanced application for both Drivers and Riders, while planning for and incorporating next-generation self-driving car capabilities as well as other transportation alternatives.
 
Marketing
 
Although still in its infancy, our marketing plan successfully reached out through various social media outlets to communicate directly with drivers and riders who will be interested in our new and innovative features and functions for shared rides. We plan on continuing and enhancing these activities through 2022 and 2023.
Status of Our Publicly Announced Products or Services
 
Our SaaS interface is still in the development stage.
 
Competition
 
We believe that our disruptive technology and ecosystem has many unique capabilities, we will be competing with the current shared-ride provider community, both domestically and internationally. Although not a complete listing, the following are what we believe are our competition, which is comprised of the large shared ride companies, specifically: Uber, Lyft, Wingz, Gett, Getaround, BlaBlaCar, RelayRides, Ridejoy, and JustshareIt.
Intellectual Property
 
We have patents and pending applications directed to ride sharing including using artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning with optimization and Smart Deployment algorithms. Our patents and pending applications involve anticipating demand for passengers and dispatching cars in advance – to reduce wait-time, increasing utilization of vehicles, and decrease cost. We also have an application pending that describes a new and efficient system for tracking and charging customers with preferred rates, supply and demand rates, and “specific” community engagement.
 
Our current patent portfolio includes: 
 

· | U.S. Patent 9,984,574, issued May 29, 2018, which claims priority to provisional application filed on Jan. 21, 2014; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | U.S. Patent 11,217,101, issued January 4, 2022, which claims priority to a provisional application filed on Jan. 21, 2014;
· | Pending U.S. application, unpublished, which claims priority to provisional application filed on Jan. 21, 2014; and 
· | Pending U.S. application, unpublished, claims priority to three provisional applications filed on Nov. 4, 2019.
