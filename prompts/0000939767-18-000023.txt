Item 1. Business
Overview
Exelixis, Inc. (“Exelixis,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a biotechnology company committed to the discovery, development and commercialization of new medicines to improve care and outcomes for people with cancer. Since our founding in 1994, three products discovered at Exelixis have progressed through clinical development, received regulatory approval, and entered the marketplace. Two are derived from cabozantinib, an inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases including MET, AXL, VEGF receptors and RET: CABOMETYX® (cabozantinib) tablets approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma, or RCC, and COMETRIQ® (cabozantinib) capsules approved for progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer, or MTC. The third product, COTELLIC® (cobimetinib) tablets, is a formulation of cobimetinib and is an inhibitor of MEK, marketed under a collaboration with Genentech, Inc. (a member of the Roche Group), and is approved as part of a combination regimen to treat advanced melanoma. Both cabozantinib and cobimetinib have shown the potential to advance the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer and are the subject of broad clinical development programs for multiple potential oncology indications.
The following is a summary of important information about our internally-discovered, marketed products:

CABOMETYX (cabozantinib) was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on April 25, 2016, for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy and by the European Commission, or EC, on September 9, 2016, similarly for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults following prior VEGF targeted therapy. On December 19, 2017, the FDA approved the expanded indication for CABOMETYX to include previously untreated patients with advanced RCC, and on September 8, 2017, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, validated the regulatory dossier for cabozantinib as a treatment for patients with previously untreated advanced RCC in the European Union, or EU. Outside the U.S. and Japan, CABOMETYX is marketed by our collaboration partner Ipsen Pharma SAS, or Ipsen. Should CABOMETYX be approved in Japan, it would be marketed by our collaboration partner Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda. In 2017, we generated $323.1 million in net product revenues from sales of CABOMETYX in the U.S.

COMETRIQ (cabozantinib), our first marketed product, was approved by the FDA on November 29, 2012, for the treatment of patients with progressive, metastatic MTC. In March 2014, the EC granted COMETRIQ a similar, conditional marketing authorization for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC. COMETRIQ is commercialized in the EU by Ipsen. In 2017, we generated $25.0 million in net product revenues from sales of COMETRIQ in the U.S. 
COTELLIC (cobimetinib) was approved by the FDA on November 10, 2015, in combination with vemurafenib for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive advanced melanoma in the U.S. It has also been approved in combination with vemurafenib in multiple other territories including the EU, Switzerland, Canada, Australia and Brazil. In 2017, we recognized $6.4 million of royalties on ex-U.S. sales of COTELLIC and recorded a net loss of $2.1 million related to our profit share from sales of COTELLIC in the U.S. under our collaboration agreement with Genentech. Cobimetinib is being evaluated in a broad development program consisting of more than 50 trials by Genentech. For additional information on the cobimetinib development program, see “Cobimetinib Development Program.”

In support of our effort to accelerate the discovery, development and commercialization of new medicines for difficult-to-treat cancers, we are focused on maximizing the opportunity for our two internally discovered compounds, cabozantinib and cobimetinib. Over the course of 2017, the revenues generated from the sale of these products and from our collaboration agreements, coupled with disciplined expense management and elimination of the debt on our balance sheet, have created a capital structure upon which we believe we can continue to grow in a sustainable manner. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to drive the expansion and depth of our product offerings through the continued development of cabozantinib both alone and in combination with other therapies, Genentech’s cobimetinib development program, the resumption of our internal drug discovery activities, and the evaluation and execution of in-licensing and acquisition opportunities that align with our oncology drug development expertise.
Key Developments
During 2017, we achieved numerous commercial, regulatory, financial and business development milestones. We also continued to build the infrastructure necessary to support anticipated corporate growth and product development beyond our current pipeline. The key developments impacting our business in 2017 include: 
Commercialization of CABOMETYX for Previously Treated Advanced RCC
In 2017, we continued to execute on the commercial launch of CABOMETYX for previously treated patients with advanced RCC. When the FDA approved our novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI, for this indication based on the results of the phase 3 METEOR trial in April 2016, we were prepared to bring CABOMETYX to market with field sales, medical affairs and market access personnel of the highest caliber, experience and professionalism. Following the initial success of the CABOMETYX launch in 2016 and in an effort to provide patients with greater access to CABOMETYX, during 2017, we expanded our distribution channel. Meanwhile our promotional and medical affairs teams have continued to focus on educating physicians on CABOMETYX’s unique product profile. CABOMETYX is distinct from other approved treatment options for previously treated patients with advanced RCC because it is the first single agent therapy approved for this indication to demonstrate statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in three key efficacy parameters: overall survival, or OS; progression-free survival, or PFS; and objective response rate, or ORR--in a global pivotal trial. This profile translated into strong product demand in 2017 as certain physicians prescribed CABOMETYX as a preferred new therapeutic option despite numerous competing products approved to treat advanced RCC. For additional information about CABOMETYX’s profile as expressed in METEOR, see “Cabozantinib Development Program - Exelixis Sponsored Trials - RCC - METEOR.”
In markets outside the U.S. and Japan in 2017, we worked closely with our partner Ipsen in support of its regulatory strategy and commercialization efforts for CABOMETYX. Utilizing its established international oncology marketing expertise, Ipsen continues to execute its commercialization plans, most recently receiving regulatory approval in Australia, Switzerland 
3

and South Korea, and having launched in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Pricing and reimbursement negotiations have been completed or are actively ongoing in the majority of EU member states.
Expansion of CABOMETYX Label as a Treatment for Previously Untreated Advanced RCC
On December 19, 2017, approximately two months ahead of the assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, action date, the FDA approved CABOMETYX for an expanded indication to include previously untreated patients with advanced RCC, the most common form of advanced kidney cancer in adults. Published studies indicate that there are approximately 30,000 patients in the U.S. and 68,000 patients globally with advanced kidney cancer who are drug-eligible, with an estimated 14,000 patients in the U.S. in the first-line setting. Utilizing our existing commercial and medical affairs organizations and established distribution network, we were prepared to bring CABOMETYX to all eligible patients in the U.S. who may benefit from this treatment option immediately upon approval of the expanded indication.
The FDA’s priority review and early approval of CABOMETYX for this indication was based on CABOSUN, a randomized phase 2 trial of cabozantinib versus sunitinib in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC, which was conducted by The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, or The Alliance, as part of our Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, with the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, or NCI-CTEP. Cabozantinib met the study’s primary endpoint of improving PFS, as compared to sunitinib in patients with intermediate- or poor-risk disease. For additional information on the results of CABOSUN, see “Cabozantinib Development Program - Clinical Trials Supporting Regulatory Approvals.”
Initiating the regulatory approval process outside of the U.S., Ipsen submitted to the EMA the regulatory dossier for CABOMETYX as a treatment for previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC in the EU on August 28, 2017 based on the CABOSUN trial results; the filing was subsequently validated on September 8, 2017.
Positive Results from the CELESTIAL Trial in Previously Treated Advanced HCC following Second Interim Analysis
On October 16, 2017, we announced that CELESTIAL, our company-sponsored, global phase 3 trial comparing cabozantinib to placebo in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, who had previously progressed on or were intolerant to sorafenib and up to one additional therapy, met its primary endpoint, with cabozantinib providing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS compared to placebo. Based on the results of CELESTIAL, we plan to submit a supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018, for CABOMETYX as a treatment for patients with previously treated advanced HCC. Ipsen has informed us that it intends to submit the regulatory application in the EU for CABOMETYX as a treatment for patients with previously treated advanced HCC in the first half of 2018.
Published studies indicate that an estimated 800,000 new cases of HCC present each year worldwide, with 41,000 of these cases in the U.S. While patients with localized disease may be candidates for surgery or other therapies such as embolization, treatment options for advanced disease are limited. Currently, sorafenib is the only approved agent for the first-line treatment of advanced, unresectable HCC. Despite sorafenib treatment, however, patients with HCC typically progress, and only regorafenib and nivolumab are approved as treatment options for sorafenib-pretreated patients. Thus, previously treated advanced HCC still represents an area of substantial unmet medical need.
Evaluation of Cabozantinib in Combination with Multiple Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
Cabozantinib has shown clinical anti-tumor activity in more than 20 forms of cancer; therefore, we are focused on advancing a broad cabozantinib clinical development program in order to fully investigate its therapeutic potential both alone and in combination with other therapies and potentially serve additional patient populations. In particular, given that clinical observations from an ongoing phase 1 trial evaluating cabozantinib in combination with Bristol-Meyers Squibb Company’s, or BMS’s, nivolumab, with or without ipilimumab, in patients with previously treated genitourinary tumors suggest treatment with cabozantinib results in a more immune-permissive tumor environment, we are interested in exploring the therapeutic potential of cabozantinib in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat a variety of types of cancer. Data from this trial showed that cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab demonstrated promising efficacy across a diverse range of genitourinary tumors, and also that patients can tolerate these drug combinations. We believe these promising early-stage clinical findings support continued, broad investigation of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors. To that end, in collaboration with BMS, in July 2017, we initiated a phase 3 pivotal trial in previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC, which, pursuant to its amended protocol, is evaluating the combination of cabozantinib with BMS’s immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab. We also initiated a phase 1/2 trial in collaboration with BMS in patients with both previously treated and previously untreated advanced HCC, 
4

evaluating cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab and in combination with both nivolumab and ipilimumab, and there is strong rationale to evaluate the combination of checkpoint inhibitors and cabozantinib in various other tumor types, including bladder cancer. 
We have not limited our clinical investigations to a single checkpoint inhibitor. In June 2017, we initiated a phase 1b trial with various expansion cohorts evaluating cabozantinib and atezolizumab, Roche’s PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor, in patients with advanced genitourinary malignancies, including RCC and urothelial carcinoma, or UC. We subsequently amended the protocol in January 2018 to add four new expansion cohorts to this trial, which will now also include patients with non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and castration-resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC, in addition to previously included patients with RCC and UC. For additional information on our clinical collaboration agreements with BMS and Roche, see “Cabozantinib Development Program - Trials Conducted Under our Clinical Collaboration Agreements.”
Expansion of Global Partnership for Cabozantinib to Japan
On January 30, 2017, we continued to advance the global development and commercialization of cabozantinib by entering into a collaboration and license agreement with Takeda for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib in Japan. Pursuant to the terms of this collaboration agreement, Takeda has exclusive commercialization rights for currently developed and potential future cabozantinib indications in Japan, and has also agreed to collaborate on cabozantinib’s future clinical development. In December 2017, Takeda confirmed that the first patient was enrolled in its bridging study evaluating cabozantinib in second-line advanced RCC in Japan. For additional information on our collaboration with Takeda, see “Collaborations - Cabozantinib Collaborations - Takeda Collaboration.”
Continued Development of COTELLIC and Resolution of Genentech Arbitration 
Genentech continues to advance the development program for cobimetinib, with three phase 3 pivotal trials currently underway exploring the combination of cobimetinib with atezolizumab or atezolizumab alone in colorectal carcinoma, or CRC, (IMblaze370) and BRAF wild type melanoma (IMspire170), and the combination of cobimetinib with atezolizumab and vemurafenib in BRAF V600 mutant melanoma (IMspire150). Enrollment for IMblaze370 was completed in the first quarter of 2017, and Genentech has announced that top-line results for the trial are expected during the first half of 2018. For additional information on the cobimetinib development program, see “Cobimetinib Development Program.”
In July 2017, we amended our collaboration agreement with Genentech in connection with the final resolution of claims asserted in an arbitration proceeding by us against Genentech related to the development, pricing and commercialization of COTELLIC. The amendment provides for a favorably revised revenue and cost-sharing arrangement, that became effective as of July 1, 2017, and that is applicable to current and all potential future commercial uses of COTELLIC. Should the ongoing IMblaze370, IMspire170 and IMspire150 clinical trials prove positive and Genentech obtain regulatory approvals based on such positive results, we believe that with the revised revenue and cost-sharing arrangement, cobimetinib could provide us with another meaningful source of revenue.
Extinguishment of All Outstanding Indebtedness
During 2017, we retired all of our outstanding debt, beginning with the repayment of our $80.0 million term loan with Silicon Valley Bank in March 2017. This repayment was followed by the June 2017 retirement of the Secured Convertible Notes due 2018 held by entities associated with Deerfield Management Company, L.P., or the Deerfield Notes, in consideration for a payment of $123.8 million. The Deerfield Notes were retired one year ahead of their July 2018 maturity date providing us with a savings of approximately $12.2 million in interest expense, net of the termination fee. As a result of the elimination of this indebtedness and increasing cash flow, we began to fund our ongoing business and growth primarily from business operations. For additional information on the repayment of our term loan with Silicon Valley Bank and the retirement of the Deerfield Notes, see “Note 6. Debt” to our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cabozantinib Development Program
Cabozantinib inhibits the activity of tyrosine kinases, including MET, AXL, VEGF receptors, and RET. These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and in pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, drug resistance and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. Objective tumor responses have been observed in patients treated with cabozantinib in more than 20 individual tumor types investigated in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials to date, reflecting the medicine’s broad clinical potential. We are currently evaluating cabozantinib, both as a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, in a broad development program comprising over 70 
5

ongoing or planned clinical trials across multiple indications. We, along with our clinical and commercial collaboration partners, sponsor some of those trials, while the remaining trials are conducted through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP or our investigator sponsored trial, or IST program.
Two summary tables of select cabozantinib clinical development activities, one listing studies evaluating the potential of cabozantinib as a single-agent, and another listing studies evaluating the potential of cabozantinib in combination with one or more immune checkpoint inhibitors, are below:

Clinical Trials Supporting Regulatory Approvals
MTC - EXAM
COMETRIQ’s safety and efficacy were assessed in an international, multi-center, randomized double-blinded controlled trial of 330 patients with progressive, metastatic MTC, known as EXAM. Patients were required to have evidence of progressive disease within 14 months prior to study entry. This assessment was performed by an independent radiology review committee, or IRRC, in 89% of patients and by the treating physicians in 11% of patients. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive COMETRIQ 140 mg (n = 219) or placebo (n = 111) orally, once daily until disease progression determined by the treating physician or until intolerable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by age (≤ 65 years vs. > 65 years) and prior use of a TKI. No cross-over was allowed at the time of progression. The primary endpoint was to compare PFS in patients receiving COMETRIQ versus patients receiving placebo. Secondary endpoints included ORR and OS. The main efficacy outcome measures of PFS, ORR and response duration were based on IRRC-confirmed events using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST, which is a widely used set of rules that defines when cancer patients improve (“respond”), stay the same (“stabilize”) or worsen (“progress”) during treatments.
EXAM served as the basis for the regulatory approval of COMETRIQ in the U.S. and EU. A statistically significant and clinically meaningful prolongation in PFS was demonstrated among COMETRIQ-treated patients compared to those receiving placebo (hazard ratio, or HR, 0.28; 95% confidence interval, or CI, 0.19-0.40; p<0.0001), with median PFS of 11.2 months in the COMETRIQ arm and 4.0 months in the placebo arm. Partial responses, or PRs, were observed only among patients in the COMETRIQ arm (27% vs. 0%; p<0.0001). The median duration of objective response was 14.7 months (95% CI 11.1-19.3) for patients treated with COMETRIQ. The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 25% of patients were diarrhea, stomatitis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, or PPES, decreased weight, decreased appetite, nausea, fatigue, oral pain, hair color changes, dysgeusia, hypertension, abdominal pain, and constipation. In November 2014, we announced completion of the OS analysis, the secondary endpoint of the study. Consistent with an earlier interim analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in OS between the treatment arms. The median OS was 26.6 months for the COMETRIQ arm and 21.1 months for the placebo arm (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.64-1.12; p = 0.2409). The subgroup analysis by RET M918T mutation status, a known negative prognostic factor in MTC, revealed an improvement in OS of 25.4 months for COMETRIQ-treated patients positive for the RET M918T mutation; the median OS was 44.3 months for the COMETRIQ arm and 18.9 months for the placebo arm (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.38-0.95; p = 
7

0.026, not adjusted for multiple subgroup testing). We presented the final results at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, 2015 Annual Meeting and submitted the results to regulatory authorities to satisfy post-marketing commitments.
In connection with the approval of COMETRIQ for the treatment of progressive, metastatic MTC, we were subject to post-marketing requirements, all of which have been satisfied, other than a requirement to conduct a clinical study comparing a lower dose of COMETRIQ with the labeled dose of 140 mg. This study is evaluating safety and PFS in progressive, metastatic MTC patients and is ongoing.
RCC - METEOR
In July 2015, we announced positive results of METEOR, a phase 3 pivotal trial comparing CABOMETYX to everolimus in patients with advanced RCC who have experienced disease progression following treatment with at least one prior VEGF receptor inhibitor. METEOR was initiated in May 2013. The trial was designed to enroll 650 patients at approximately 200 sites. Patients were stratified based on the number of prior VEGF receptor inhibitors received, and on commonly applied RCC risk criteria. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 60 mg of CABOMETYX daily or 10 mg of everolimus daily and no cross-over was allowed between the study arms. The METEOR trial was designed to provide adequate power to assess both the primary endpoint of PFS, and the secondary endpoint of OS. The trial protocol specified that the primary analysis of PFS would be conducted among the first 375 patients randomized while the secondary endpoint of OS would be conducted among all 650 patients randomized. This design was employed to ensure sufficient follow-up and a PFS profile that would not be primarily weighted toward early events. Such disproportionate weighting of events was a potential risk if the entire study population required for the secondary endpoint analysis of OS had also served as the population for the primary analysis of PFS. On September 26, 2015, The New England Journal of Medicine published the complete, detailed positive results from the primary analysis of METEOR, and these results were also presented during the Presidential Session I at the European Cancer Congress 2015. The trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful increase in PFS for CABOMETYX, as determined by an IRRC among the first 375 patients enrolled. The median PFS was 7.4 months for the CABOMETYX arm versus 3.8 months for the everolimus arm, and the HR was 0.58 (95% CI 0.45-0.75; p<001), corresponding to a 42% reduction in the rate of disease progression or death for CABOMETYX compared to everolimus. The trial also showed that CABOMETYX significantly improved the ORR. The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 25% of patients were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, PPES, hypertension, vomiting, weight decreased, and constipation.
A review of adverse events, or AEs, demonstrated that the frequency of AEs of any grade regardless of causality was approximately balanced between study arms, and the rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs was 9% and 10% for CABOMETYX and everolimus, respectively. With additional follow-up for OS, the study also met its secondary endpoint of OS as presented in June 2016 at the ASCO 2016 Annual Meeting and published in Lancet Oncology. Compared with everolimus, CABOMETYX was associated with a 34% reduction in the rate of death and median OS was 21.4 months for patients receiving CABOMETYX versus 16.5 months for those receiving everolimus (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.53-0.83; p=0.0003). 
In January 2016, an analysis of PFS among all 658 patients enrolled was presented at the 2016 ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium, and revealed consistent results with the primary analysis showing a median PFS of 7.4 months for the CABOMETYX arm versus 3.9 months for the everolimus arm, and the HR was 0.52 (95% CI 0.43-0.64; p<0.001), corresponding to a 48% reduction in the rate of disease progression or death for CABOMETYX as compared to everolimus. In addition, subgroup analyses for PFS showed consistent beneficial effect of CABOMETYX versus everolimus; subgroups included: ECOG performance status; commonly applied RCC risk groups as described by Motzer et al.; organ involvement, including bone and visceral metastases and overall tumor burden; extent and type of prior VEGF receptor inhibitor therapy; and prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. For patients without prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, median PFS was 7.4 months for CABOMETYX and 3.9 months for everolimus (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.44-0.66). For patients who had received prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, the median PFS for CABOMETYX was not reached, and the median PFS for everolimus was 4.1 months (HR 0.22; 95% CI 0.07-0.65). Subgroup analyses for ORR also showed consistent benefit for CABOMETYX as compared to everolimus.
On the basis of the data from the METEOR trial, the FDA approved CABOMETYX for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC following prior antiangiogenic therapy, and the EMA approved CABOMETYX for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults following prior VEGF targeted therapy.
RCC - CABOSUN
In October 2016, we announced detailed results from CABOSUN, a randomized phase 2 trial of cabozantinib in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC with intermediate- or poor-risk disease conducted by The Alliance under 
8

our CRADA with NCI-CTEP. CABOSUN was a randomized, open-label, active-controlled phase 2 trial that enrolled 157 patients with advanced RCC. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive cabozantinib (60 mg once daily) or sunitinib (50 mg once daily, 4 weeks on followed by 2 weeks off). The primary endpoint was PFS. Secondary endpoints included OS and ORR. Eligible patients were required to have locally advanced or metastatic clear-cell RCC, ECOG performance status 0-2, and had to be intermediate or poor risk per the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium, or IMDC criteria (Heng, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 2009). 
CABOSUN met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in investigator-assessed PFS compared with sunitinib. With a median follow-up of 21.4 months, cabozantinib demonstrated a 34% reduction in the rate of disease progression or death (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.46-0.95; one-sided p=0.012). The median PFS for cabozantinib was 8.2 months versus 5.6 months for sunitinib, corresponding to a 2.6 months (46%) improvement favoring cabozantinib over sunitinib. PFS benefits were independent of the IMDC risk group (intermediate or poor risk) and presence or absence of bone metastases at baseline. The results for sunitinib were in line with a previously published retrospective analysis of 1,174 intermediate- and poor-risk RCC patients from the IMDC database, which documented a median PFS of 5.6 months with a first-line targeted therapy, mainly sunitinib, in this patient population. Investigator-assessed ORR was also significantly improved, at 33% (95% CI 23% - 44%) for cabozantinib versus 12% (95% CI 5.4% - 21%) for sunitinib. With a median follow-up of 22.8 months, median OS was 30.3 months for cabozantinib versus 21.8 months for sunitinib (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.50 - 1.26). The most common grade 3 or 4 AEs with cabozantinib were hypertension (28%), diarrhea (10%), PPES (8%), and fatigue (6%); with sunitinib, they were hypertension (22%), fatigue (15%), diarrhea (11%), and thrombocytopenia (11%). Grade 5 AEs occurred in four patients (5%) in the cabozantinib group and five patients (7%) in the sunitinib group. Treatment-related grade 5 events occurred in three patients in the cabozantinib group (acute kidney injury, sepsis, and jejunal perforation) and three patients in the sunitinib group (sepsis, respiratory failure, and vascular disorders). The rate of treatment discontinuation because of AEs was 20% (n = 16) and 21% (n = 16) in the cabozantinib and sunitinib groups, respectively. 
On September 19, 2017, updated results from CABOSUN were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO, 2017 Congress. The results included the analysis from a blinded IRC, which confirmed the primary efficacy endpoint results of investigator-assessed PFS, as well as an updated investigator-assessed analysis. Per the IRC analysis, cabozantinib demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 52% reduction in the rate of disease progression or death (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.31-0.74; two-sided p=0.0008). The median PFS for cabozantinib was 8.6 months versus 5.3 months for sunitinib, corresponding to a 3.3 month (62%) improvement favoring cabozantinib over sunitinib. The updated data sets and methods differ from the initial investigator analyses presented in 2016. The comprehensive image collection for IRC review used a later cut-off point (5 months) than the initial investigator analysis and followed a rigorous IRC review process. The analysis of IRC data applied FDA guidance for PFS analyses in oncology studies, including recommended censoring rules. Both the updated investigator assessment and IRC analysis demonstrated consistent and statistically significant improvement of PFS with cabozantinib as compared to sunitinib. The updated OS analysis had a data cut-off of July 1, 2017, and showed a favorable trend for patients randomized to cabozantinib compared to sunitinib that was not statistically significant. Median OS was 26.6 months for patients receiving cabozantinib versus 21.2 months for those receiving sunitinib (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.53-1.21; two-sided p=0.29). The most common all-causality grade 3 or 4 AEs in more than 5% of patients for cabozantinib (N=78) and sunitinib (N=72), respectively, were diarrhea (10% vs. 11%), hypertension (28% vs. 21%), fatigue (6% vs. 17%), increased alanine aminotransferase (5% vs. 0%), decreased appetite (5% vs. 1%), PPES (8% vs. 4%), decreased platelet count (1% vs. 11%) and stomatitis (5% vs. 6%). 21% of patients in the cabozantinib arm and 22% of patients in the sunitinib arm discontinued treatment due to AEs.
On the basis of the data from the CABOSUN trial, the FDA approved CABOMETYX for the treatment of patients with previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC on December 19, 2017, and we commenced our commercial launch of CABOMETYX for this new indication upon such approval. Additionally, on September 8, 2017, the EMA validated the regulatory dossier for cabozantinib as a treatment for previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC in the EU.
Exelixis Sponsored Trials
HCC - CELESTIAL
In October 2017, we announced positive results of CELESTIAL, our phase 3 pivotal trial comparing cabozantinib to placebo in patients with advanced HCC who had received previous treatment with sorafenib. The CELESTIAL trial, which we initiated in September 2013, was designed to enroll 760 patients who were intolerant to or who had received prior systemic therapy with sorafenib, could have received up to two prior systemic cancer therapies for advanced HCC, and must have progressed following at least one prior therapy. The CELESTIAL trial was conducted at more than 100 sites globally in 19 
9

countries and enrollment was completed in September 2017. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive 60 mg of cabozantinib daily or placebo and were stratified based on etiology of the disease (hepatitis C, hepatitis B or other), geographic region (Asia versus other regions) and presence of extrahepatic spread and/or macrovascular invasion (yes or no). No cross-over was allowed between the study arms. 
The primary endpoint for the trial was OS, and secondary endpoints included ORR and PFS. Exploratory endpoints include patient-reported outcomes, biomarkers and safety. A total of 621 events provided the study with 90% power to detect a 32% increase in median OS (HR 0.76) at the final analysis. Two interim analyses were planned to be conducted at 50% and 75% of the planned 621 events. Following the first interim analysis, on September 6, 2016, we announced that CELESTIAL’s independent data monitoring committee, or IDMC, determined that the study should continue without modifications per the study protocol for a second interim analysis to take place once 75% of events had been observed. Subsequently, on October 16, 2017, following the second interim analysis, the IDMC, recommended that CELESTIAL be stopped for efficacy, providing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement versus placebo in OS. On January 19, 2018, statistically significant and clinically meaningful positive results from the second interim analysis of CELESTIAL were presented during an oral session at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology’s Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. In the total population of second- and third-line patients, median OS was 10.2 months with cabozantinib versus 8.0 months with placebo (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.63-0.92; p=0.0049). Median PFS was more than doubled, at 5.2 months with cabozantinib and 1.9 months with placebo (HR 0.44; 95% CI 0.36-0.52; p<0.0001). ORR was 4% with cabozantinib and 0.4% with placebo (p=0.0086). Disease control (PR or stable disease, or SD) was achieved by 64% of the cabozantinib group compared with 33% of the placebo group. In a subgroup analysis of patients whose only prior therapy for advanced HCC was sorafenib (70% of patients in the study), median OS was 11.3 months with cabozantinib versus 7.2 months with placebo (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.55-0.88). PFS in the subgroup was 5.5 months with cabozantinib versus 1.9 months with placebo (HR 0.40; 95% CI 0.32-0.50). The most commonly reported grade 3 or 4 AEs occurring in at least 10% of the patients were PPES, hypertension, increased aspartate aminotransferase, fatigue and diarrhea. Treatment-related grade 5 AEs occurred in six patients in the cabozantinib group and included, hepatic failure, esophagobronchial fistula, portal vein thrombosis, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism and hepatorenal syndrome and in one patient in the placebo group (hepatic failure).
Based on the results of CELESTIAL, we plan to submit a sNDA to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018, for CABOMETYX as a treatment for patients with previously treated advanced HCC. Our partner, Ipsen, has informed us that it intends to submit a regulatory dossier for CABOMETYX as a treatment for patients with previously treated advanced HCC to the EMA in the first half of 2018.
Trials Conducted Under our Clinical Collaboration Agreements
Clinical observations from an ongoing phase 1 trial evaluating cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab, with or without ipilimumab, in patients with previously treated genitourinary tumors suggest that when cabozantinib is given with immune checkpoint inhibitors, the combination may result in a more immune-permissive tumor environment. In consideration of those results, in February 2017, we entered into individual clinical collaboration agreements with BMS and Roche, for the purpose of conducting clinical studies combining cabozantinib with BMS’s PD-1 and CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors and Roche’s anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. 
Combination Studies with BMS
We entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with BMS in February 2017 for the purpose of exploring the therapeutic potential of cabozantinib in combination with BMS’s immune checkpoint inhibitors, nivolumab and/or ipilimumab, to treat a variety of types of cancer. As part of the collaboration, we are evaluating various forms of these combinations in a phase 3 pivotal trial in previously untreated or metastatic advanced RCC and in a phase 1/2 trial in both previously treated and previously untreated advanced HCC. We also intend to evaluate these combinations in various other tumor types, including bladder cancer. 
Pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement with BMS, each party granted to the other a non-exclusive, worldwide (within the collaboration territory as defined in the collaboration agreement), non-transferable, royalty-free license to use the other party’s compounds in the conduct of each clinical trial. The parties’ efforts are governed through a joint development committee established to guide and oversee the collaboration’s operation. Each trial will be conducted under a combination Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, unless otherwise required by a regulatory authority. Each party will be responsible for supplying drug product for the applicable clinical trial and unless otherwise agreed between the parties, costs for each such trial will be shared equally between the parties, unless two BMS compounds will 
10

be utilized in such trial, in which case BMS will bear two-thirds of the costs for such study treatment arms and we will bear one-third of the costs. Unless earlier terminated, the collaboration agreement will remain in effect until the completion of all clinical trials under the collaboration, all related trial data has been delivered to both parties and the completion of any then agreed upon analysis. The collaboration agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on uncured material breach by the other party, bankruptcy of the other party or for safety reasons. Upon termination by either party, the licenses granted to each party to conduct a combined therapy trial will terminate.
RCC - CheckMate 9ER
CheckMate 9ER is an open-label, randomized, multi-national phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating nivolumab in combination with cabozantinib or nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with cabozantinib versus sunitinib in patients with previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC. The original trial protocol required patients to be randomized 1:1:1 to one of three arms: cabozantinib and nivolumab; cabozantinib, nivolumab and ipilimumab; or sunitinib. However, following the positive results of CheckMate 214, BMS’s phase 3 trial evaluating nivolumab combined with ipilimumab versus sunitinib monotherapy in patients with previously untreated metastatic RCC and in an effort to accelerate the development of the cabozantinib and nivolumab combination, the trial protocol was amended to remove the triplet combination. The triplet combination continues to be evaluated in an ongoing phase 1b trial in patients with advanced genitourinary malignancies and a separate phase 3 trial evaluating the triplet combination versus nivolumab and ipilimumab is under evaluation. The modified protocol for the trial aims to enroll approximately 580 patients with previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC of all risk groups. Patients are being randomized 1:1 to receive 40 mg of cabozantinib daily and 240 mg of nivolumab every 2 weeks or 50 mg of sunitinib daily on a 4 week/2 week off schedule. The primary endpoint for the trial is PFS and the secondary endpoint is OS.
HCC - Checkmate 040
CheckMate 040 is a phase 1/2 trial evaluating treatment regimens including cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab and in combination with both nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sorafenib in patients with previously treated and previously untreated advanced HCC. The protocol for the trial aims to enroll approximately 30 patients each to cohorts that will receive either 40 mg of cabozantinib daily and 3 mg of nivolumab every two weeks or 40 mg of cabozantinib daily, 3 mg of nivolumab every two weeks, and 1 mg ipilimumab every 3 weeks for a total of 4 administrations. The primary objectives for the cohorts are safety and tolerability, ORR and duration of response, or DOR, and the secondary objectives include time to progression, PFS and OS.
Combination Study with Roche - Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
In February 2017, we entered into a master clinical supply agreement with Roche for the purpose of evaluating cabozantinib and atezolizumab in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement with Roche, in June 2017, we initiated a phase 1b dose escalation study that is evaluating the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib in combination with Roche’s atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. We are the trial sponsor, and Roche is providing atezolizumab free of charge.
The study is divided into two parts: a dose-escalation phase and an expansion cohort phase. The dose-escalation phase of the trial is enrolling up to 36 patients either with advanced RCC with or without prior systemic therapy or with inoperable, locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent UC (including renal, pelvis, ureter, urinary bladder and urethra) after prior platinum-based therapy. The primary objective is to determine the optimal dose and schedule of daily oral administration of cabozantinib when given in combination with atezolizumab to inform the trial’s subsequent expansion stage. Cabozantinib doses of 40 mg daily and 60 mg daily are being evaluated. All patients will receive the standard atezolizumab dosing regimen of 1200 mg infusion once every 3 weeks.
In January 2018, we amended the protocol to add four new expansion cohorts to the trial, which will now also include patients with NSCLC and CRPC, in addition to previously included patients with RCC and UC. The primary objective in the expansion stage of this trial remains to determine the ORR in each cohort. Once the recommended dose and schedule are determined, which is anticipated to occur in the first half of 2018, the trial will begin to enroll the eight expansion cohorts, which are as follows:

• | patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC without a defined tumor genetic alteration (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or BRAF) who have not received prior therapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor;


• | patients with NSCLC without a defined tumor genetic alteration who have progressed following treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor;

11


• | patients with UC who have progressed following treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor;


• | patients with CRPC who have previously received enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate and experienced radiographic disease progression in soft tissue;


• | patients with RCC with clear cell histology who have not had prior systemic anticancer therapy;


• | patients with UC who have progressed on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy;


• | patients with UC who are ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy and have not received prior systemic chemotherapy for inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic disease; and


• | patients with UC who are eligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy and have not received prior systemic chemotherapy for inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic disease.

Each expansion cohort will initially enroll approximately 30 patients, although the cohorts of patients with UC or NSCLC who have been previously treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor may enroll up to 80 each, for a total of up to 340 patients. 
Trials Conducted through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP and our IST Program
In October 2011, we entered into a CRADA with NCI-CTEP for the clinical development of cabozantinib. Through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP and our IST program we have been able to expand the cabozantinib development program while avoiding over-burdening our internal development resources. Our CRADA reflects a major commitment by NCI-CTEP to support the broad exploration of cabozantinib’s potential in a wide variety of cancers, each representing a substantial unmet medical need. Through this mechanism, NCI-CTEP provides funding for as many as 20 active clinical trials of cabozantinib each year for a five-year period. The term of the CRADA was extended in October 2016 for an additional five-year period through October 2021, provided that both parties maintain the right to terminate the CRADA for any reason upon sixty days’ notice, for an uncured material breach upon thirty days’ notice and immediately for safety concerns. IND applications for trials under the CRADA are held by NCI-CTEP. NCI-CTEP also retains rights to any inventions made in whole or in part by NCI-CTEP investigators. However, for inventions that claim the use and/or the composition of cabozantinib, we have an automatic option to elect a worldwide, non-exclusive license to cabozantinib inventions for commercial purposes, with the right to sublicense to affiliates or collaborators working on our behalf, as well as an additional, separate option to negotiate an exclusive license to cabozantinib inventions. Further, before any trial proposed under the CRADA may commence, the protocol is subject to our review and approval, and the satisfaction of certain other conditions. We believe our CRADA with NCI-CTEP has and will enable us to continue to expand the cabozantinib development program broadly in a cost-efficient manner.
Advanced Genitourinary Tumors
Results from a phase 1 trial evaluating cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with previously treated genitourinary tumors being conducted under our CRADA with NCI-CTEP were first presented at the ESMO 2016 Congress in October 2016 and most recently updated at the 2018 ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in February 2018. The primary endpoint of the trial is to determine the dose-limiting toxicity and recommended doses of the doublet and triplet combinations for later stage clinical studies. The secondary endpoint is clinical response rate as assessed by RECIST 1.1.
The updated data reported results from 78 patients treated with either cabozantinib and nivolumab with or without ipilimumab. The initial part of the study determined the recommended dose for each treatment at four dose levels. In all, 49 patients were treated with the doublet combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab and 29 patients were treated with the triplet combination of cabozantinib, nivolumab and ipilimumab. Nineteen patients with metastatic UC were evaluable for response with a median follow up of 15.7 months. Thirteen patients with previously treated metastatic RCC were evaluable for response.
For the metastatic UC cohort, the ORR across all treatment groups was 42% (2 complete responses, or CRs, and 6 PRs of 19 patients) and the disease control rate, or DCR, (DCR = CR, PR and SD) was 84%. Seven of eight (88%) metastatic UC patients with an objective response had not progressed at the time of the data cut-off. Median PFS in this patient population was 12.8 months and the OS rate at 12 months was 77%. Among the 13 patients with metastatic RCC who were evaluable for response, ORR was 54 percent (7 PRs of 13 patients) and the DCR was 100 percent. In the overall study the ORR in 64 evaluable patients was 36% (3 CRs and 20 PRs) with a median DOR of 24 months. 78 patients were included in the safety analysis. Expected immune-related events including colitis, meningitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and endocrine disorders occurred at a low frequency. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed in the study. Based on general tolerability, the 
12

recommended cabozantinib dose for the expanded dose cohorts and for future late stage evaluation has been determined as cabozantinib at 40 mg daily oral dose combined with nivolumab at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses.
Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 AEs (>5% of patients) observed in the doublet combination included lipase increased (16%), hypophosphatemia (14%), neutrophil count decreased (12%), hypertension (8%) and fatigue (6%). Grade 3 or 4 AEs (>5% of patients) observed in the triplet combination included hypophosphatemia (21%), lymphocyte count decreased (14%), ALT increased (14%), lipase increased (14%), AST increased (10%), hypertension (10%), diarrhea (10%), hypokalemia (10%), fatigue (7%), hyponatremia (7%) and amylase increased (7%). Grade 3 or 4 immune-related AEs for the doublet combination included colitis, aseptic meningitis, and hepatitis (one patient each) and for the triplet combination colitis (one patient) and hepatitis (two patients). There were no treatment-related deaths.
We believe these promising early stage clinical findings support further investigation of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors in a number of genitourinary tumors. Based on these phase 1 trial results, we initiated CheckMate 9ER, a phase 3 pivotal trial in patients with previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC, which, pursuant to its amended protocol, is evaluating the combination of cabozantinib with BMS’s nivolumab.
NSCLC
In November 2014, we announced positive top-line results from a randomized phase 2 trial of cabozantinib and erlotinib alone or in combination as second- or third-line therapy in patients with stage IV EGFR wild-type NSCLC. This trial (Study E1512) was sponsored through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP and was conducted by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group. It enrolled 125 patients with EGFR wild-type metastatic NSCLC who had received at least one or two prior chemotherapy regimens; of these, 111 patients were evaluable for efficacy and 118 patients were evaluable for safety. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive erlotinib (150 mg daily), cabozantinib (60 mg daily), or the combination of erlotinib plus cabozantinib (150 mg plus 40 mg daily).
The positive results from this trial were reported at the ASCO 2015 Annual Meeting on May 31, 2015, and subsequently published online in Lancet Oncology on November 4, 2016. The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating significant increases in PFS for cabozantinib and the combination of cabozantinib plus erlotinib when individually compared to the erlotinib arm. The median PFS for the combination of cabozantinib and erlotinib was 4.7 months versus 1.8 months for erlotinib alone, a more than two-fold increase. The HR was 0.37 (80% CI 0.25-0.53, p=0.0003), which corresponds to a 63% reduction in the rate of disease worsening. The median PFS for cabozantinib monotherapy was 4.3 months versus 1.8 months for erlotinib alone, and the HR was 0.39 (80% CI 0.27-0.55, p=0.0003), corresponding to a 61% reduction in the rate of disease worsening. OS was a secondary endpoint of the trial. Median OS was 13.3 months for the combination of cabozantinib and erlotinib, and 9.2 months for cabozantinib alone, as compared to 5.1 months for erlotinib alone. When individually compared to the erlotinib arm, HR for OS was 0.51 (p=0.011), corresponding to a 49% reduction in the rate of death for the combination of cabozantinib plus erlotinib, and 0.68 (p=0.071), corresponding to a 32% reduction in the rate of death for the cabozantinib monotherapy arm. ORR, another secondary endpoint, was 3% for the combination arm (1 PR), 11% (4 PRs) for the cabozantinib monotherapy arm, and 3% (1 PR) for the erlotinib arm. SD as a best response was observed in 46% of patients in the combination arm and 50% in the cabozantinib monotherapy arm, compared with 16% in the erlotinib arm. 119 patients were evaluable for safety. The most common treatment-related AEs grade 3 or higher, for the combination arm (n=39) were: diarrhea (28%), fatigue (15%), and anorexia (8%). For the cabozantinib monotherapy arm, the most common AEs, grade 3 or higher, were: hypertension (25%), fatigue (15%), mucositis (10%), diarrhea (8%), and thromboembolic events (8%). The most common AEs, grade 3 or higher, for the erlotinib arm were fatigue (13%) and diarrhea (8%). Overall, the rate of grade 3 or higher AEs was 72% in the combination arm, 70% in the cabozantinib monotherapy arm, and 33% in the erlotinib arm.
Informed by these clinical results, we are working with clinical collaborators to explore cabozantinib’s further development in NSCLC, including potential combination approaches with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as within one of the expansion cohorts of our phase 1b study with Roche evaluating the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab.
Other Cancer Indications
There are 31 ongoing and 29 planned externally sponsored trials evaluating the clinical and therapeutic potential of cabozantinib, including those administered through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP and our IST program. Like our CRADA with NCI-CTEP, our IST program helps us to continue to evaluate cabozantinib across a broad range of tumor types. 
13

These externally sponsored trials include signal seeking studies of single-agent cabozantinib, novel combinations, and randomized trials. The monotherapy trials are focused on solid tumors including genitourinary neoplasms, gastrointestinal malignancies, lung cancer and a variety of less common tumor types. The combination studies include trials combining cabozantinib with several different immune checkpoint inhibitors, as well as studies adding cabozantinib to monoclonal antibodies and small molecules which target specific cellular pathways. Randomized trials within the CRADA include a phase 3 study in neuroendocrine tumors and phase 2 trials in both endometrial cancer in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and in prostate cancer in combination with docetaxel.
A complete listing of all ongoing cabozantinib trials can be found at www.ClinicalTrials.gov.
Cobimetinib Development Program
In addition to the advances made under our cabozantinib development program, significant progress continues to be made with respect to the clinical development, regulatory status and commercial potential of cobimetinib. Cobimetinib is a reversible inhibitor of MEK, a kinase that is a component of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. This pathway mediates signaling downstream of growth factor receptors, and is prominently activated in a wide variety of human tumors.  Cobimetinib is being evaluated in a broad development program consisting of more than 50 clinical trials by Genentech or through Genentech’s investigator sponsored trial program.
A summary table of Genentech’s ongoing phase 3 cobimetinib development activities, all of which are sponsored by Genentech, is provided below:

Indication | Combination Regimen | Status Update 
Metastatic or Unresectable Locally Advanced Melanoma
BRAF mutation-positive | + vemurafenib | Approved in U.S., EU and other territories 
First-line BRAF mutation-positive | + atezolizumab + vemurafenib | Phase 3 (IMspire150) 
First-line BRAF wild-type | + atezolizumab | Phase 3 (IMspire170) 
Colorectal Cancer 
Third-line advanced or metastatic disease | + atezolizumab | Phase 3 (IMblaze370); data expected in H1 2018 (per Genentech guidance)

Melanoma - coBRIM
In July 2014, we announced positive top-line results from coBRIM, the phase 3 pivotal trial conducted by Genentech evaluating cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib in previously untreated patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma harboring a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation. Data were subsequently presented at ESMO in September 2014. The trial met its primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant increase in investigator-determined PFS. The median PFS was 9.9 months for the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib versus 6.2 months for vemurafenib alone (HR 0.51; 95 percent CI 0.39-0.68; p<0.0001), demonstrating the combination reduced the risk of the disease worsening by half (49 percent). The median PFS as established by an IRRC, a secondary endpoint, was 11.3 months for the combination arm compared to 6.0 months for the control arm (HR 0.60; 95 percent CI 0.45-0.79; p=0.0003). ORR, another secondary endpoint, was 68% for the combination versus 45% for vemurafenib alone (p<0.0001). Updated results for PFS and ORR from coBRIM were presented at the ASCO 2015 Annual Meeting and showed a median PFS of 12.3 months for vemurafenib plus cobimetinib versus 7.2 months for vemurafenib alone (HR 0.58; 95 percent CI 0.46-0.72) and an ORR of 70% for the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib versus 50% for vemurafenib alone. In November 2015, we announced that the coBRIM trial also met its OS secondary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant increase in OS for the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib compared to vemurafenib monotherapy. The median OS was 22.3 months for the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib versus 17.4 months for vemurafenib alone, corresponding to a 30% reduction in the rate of death for the combination as compared to vemurafenib alone (HR 0.70; 95 percent CI 0.55-0.90; p= 0.005). The safety profile of the combination was consistent with that observed in a previous study. The most common adverse drug reactions for COTELLIC occurring in at least 20% of patients were diarrhea, photosensitivity reaction, nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting.
CoBRIM served as the basis for the regulatory approval of COTELLIC in combination with Zelboraf as a treatment for patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive advanced melanoma in the U.S., Switzerland, the EU, Canada, Australia, Brazil and other countries.

CRC - IMblaze370
In June 2016, Genentech initiated IMblaze370, a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating the combination of cobimetinib and atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, or atezolizumab alone versus regorafenib, in unresectable locally advanced or metastatic CRC patients who have received at least two lines of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy. IMblaze370 was informed by results from Genentech’s ongoing phase 1b trial of the same combination in advanced CRC. The trial is designed to enroll 360 patients who have received at least two prior chemotherapies in the metastatic disease setting. Enrollment for IMblaze370 was completed in the first quarter of 2017, and Genentech has announced that top-line results for the trial are expected during the first half of 2018. The primary endpoint of the trial is OS.
Melanoma - IMspire150
In January 2017, Genentech initiated IMspire150, a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating the combination of cobimetinib, vemurafenib and atezolizumab vs. cobimetinib plus vemurafenib in previously untreated BRAF V600 mutation positive patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma. This trial was based on the results of Genentech’s ongoing phase 1b trial in the same patient population. The trial is designed to enroll 500 patients, and the primary endpoint is PFS. 
Melanoma - IMspire170
In October 2017, Genentech initiated IMspire170, a phase 3 trial comparing cobimetinib plus atezolizumab to pembrolizumab in previously untreated BRAF WT patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma. IMspire170 was based on the results of Genentech’s ongoing phase 1b trial in the same patient population. The trial is designed to enroll 500 patients with primary endpoints of PFS and OS, and the first patient was enrolled in December 2017. 
Other Cancer Indications
In addition to coBRIM, IMblaze370, IMspire150 and IMspire170, additional earlier-stage clinical trials are ongoing studying the combination of cobimetinib with a variety of agents in multiple tumor types. These include:

• | the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib in additional melanoma patient populations and settings;


• | a phase 2 trial of cobimetinib in combination with taxanes, with or without atezolizumab in first-line triple negative breast cancer (COLET);


• | Phase 2 studies of cobimetinib in combination with atezolizumab in RCC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, UC and hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer;


• | Phase 1/2 studies of cobimetinib in combination with atezolizumab in melanoma and NSCLC, in combination with vemurafenib and atezolizumab in melanoma, and in combination with venetoclax in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma;


• | a phase 1b study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib in combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic CRC; and


• | a phase 1b/2 study of cobimetinib in combination with atezolizumab (one arm of a randomized umbrella study) in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

A complete listing of all ongoing cobimetinib trials can be found at www.ClinicalTrials.gov.
XL888 Development Program
XL888 is an Exelixis-discovered highly potent small molecule oral inhibitor of Heat Shock Protein 90, a molecular chaperone protein that affects the activity and stability of a range of key regulatory proteins, including kinases such as BRAF, MET and VEGFR2, which are implicated in cancer cell proliferation and survival. Based on clinical data, investigators at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center initiated an investigator-sponsored phase 1 trial, evaluating the safety and activity of XL888 in combination with vemurafenib in patients with unresectable stage III/IV BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma. In November 2014, we announced positive preliminary results from this phase 1 trial. The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination, including determination of a maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, for XL888. Secondary endpoints included ORR (RECIST-1 criteria), estimates of PFS and OS, and analysis of pharmacodynamic biomarkers. The trial had enrolled fifteen subjects, and at the time of data cut-off, objective tumor regression was observed in 11 of 12 response-evaluable patients (two CRs and nine PRs), for an ORR of 92%. Safety data for the combination identified tolerable dose levels of XL888 with full dose vemurafenib.

Based on these results, as well as findings from coBRIM, the phase 3 pivotal trial of cobimetinib, an Exelixis-discovered MEK inhibitor, and vemurafenib in previously untreated metastatic melanoma patients with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, investigators at the Moffitt Cancer Center initiated a phase 1b IST of the triple combination of vemurafenib, cobimetinib, and XL888 in a similar patient population during the second quarter of 2016.
Drug Discovery and Business Development Programs
We are actively focused on expanding our pipeline through internal drug discovery and targeted business development activities.
Drug Discovery
In 2016, we resumed internal drug discovery efforts with the goal of identifying novel and promising therapeutic candidates to advance into clinical trials. From 2000 until 2012, we had an active Discovery group that advanced 22 compounds to the IND stage, either independently or with collaboration partners, including cabozantinib and cobimetinib. We built significant infrastructure, including a library of 4.6 million compounds, and gained extensive experience in the identification and optimization of drug candidates against multiple target classes for oncology, inflammation and metabolic diseases.
Our new discovery organization is leveraging that history in a focused and measured manner. We are concentrating our in-house work on the most demanding aspects of lead optimization and use contract research organizations to support more routine activities, thereby minimizing our internal footprint while still maintaining an agile, competitive approach. We are and will continue to be judicious in the selection of targets, focusing on those with robust preclinical validation datasets. We anticipate that our experience and ability to identify high quality lead compounds through use of our propriety compound library will permit us to prosecute competitive and productive discovery programs in areas of high potential.
Business Development
Building upon our existing collaborative relationships, we are focused on entering into additional partnerships or licensing agreements for attractive oncology assets that would augment our development pipeline thereby utilizing our established and validated clinical development infrastructure. In addition we are seeking external partnerships around assets and new technologies that complement our in house drug discovery efforts. These partnerships are aimed at expanding our ability to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies with the aim of providing new treatment options for cancer patients and their physicians.
In January 2018, we entered into an exclusive collaboration and license agreement with StemSynergy Therapeutics, Inc. for the discovery and development of novel oncology compounds targeting Casein Kinase 1 alpha, or CK1α, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway implicated in key oncogenic processes. Activation of β-catenin, a key downstream component of the pathway, is increased in multiple tumors, including a majority of colorectal cancers, where mutations in the APC gene that result in β-catenin stabilization are prevalent. Compounds targeting CK1α have also been shown to induce degradation of β-catenin and pygopus, another member of the pathway, in preclinical CRC models, and to inhibit the growth of tumors. Importantly, their GI-sparing qualities may help overcome limitations of other approaches targeting the Wnt pathway. Under the terms of the agreement, we will partner with StemSynergy to conduct preclinical and clinical studies with compounds targeting CK1α.
Collaborations
We have established collaborations with Ipsen and Takeda for cabozantinib, Genentech for cobimetinib, and other collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies including, Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, or Daiichi Sankyo, Merck (known as MSD outside of the U.S. and Canada), BMS, and Sanofi for compounds and programs in our portfolio. Under each of our collaborations, we are entitled to receive milestones and royalties or, in the case of cobimetinib, royalties from sales outside the U.S. and a share of profits (or losses) from commercialization in the U.S. For information on our collaboration agreements focused solely on the clinical development of cabozantinib in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, see “Cabozantinib Development Program - Trials Conducted Under our Clinical Collaboration Agreements.”

Cabozantinib Collaborations
Ipsen Collaboration
In February 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Ipsen for the commercialization and further development of cabozantinib. Pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement, Ipsen received exclusive commercialization rights for current and potential future cabozantinib indications outside of the U.S., Canada and Japan. The collaboration agreement was subsequently amended in December 2016 to include commercialization rights in Canada. We have also agreed to collaborate with Ipsen on the development of cabozantinib for current and potential future indications. The parties’ efforts are governed through a joint steering committee and appropriate subcommittees established to guide and oversee the collaboration’s operation and strategic direction; provided, however, that we retain final decision-making authority with respect to cabozantinib’s ongoing development. 
 In consideration for the exclusive license and other rights contained in the collaboration agreement, including commercialization rights in Canada, Ipsen paid us aggregate upfront payments of $210.0 million. As of December 31, 2017, we achieved aggregate milestone payments of $125.0 million related to regulatory and commercial progress by Ipsen since the inception of the collaboration agreement. We are also eligible to receive future development and regulatory milestone payments, totaling up to an additional $209.0 million, including milestone payments of $10.0 million and $40.0 million upon EMA filing and the approval of cabozantinib as a treatment for patients with previously treated advanced HCC and additional milestone payments for other future indications and/or jurisdictions. The collaboration agreement also provides that we will be eligible to receive contingent payments of up to $546.0 million associated with the achievement of specified levels of Ipsen sales to end users. We will also receive royalties on net sales of cabozantinib by Ipsen outside of the U.S. and Japan. Excluding Ipsen sales in Canada, we received a 2% royalty on the first $50.0 million of net sales, which was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017, and are entitled to receive a 12% royalty on the next $100.0 million of net sales, and following this initial $150.0 million of net sales, we are then entitled to receive a tiered royalty of 22% to 26% on annual net sales. These tiers will reset each calendar year. In Canada, we are entitled to receive a tiered royalty of 22% on the first CAD$30.0 million of annual net sales and a tiered royalty thereafter to 26% on annual net sales; these tiers will also reset each calendar year. As of December 31, 2017, we have earned royalties of $4.0 million on net sales of cabozantinib by Ipsen since the inception of the collaboration agreement. 
We are primarily responsible for funding cabozantinib-related development costs for those trials in existence at the time we entered into the collaboration agreement with Ipsen; global development costs for additional trials are shared between the parties, with Ipsen reimbursing us for 35% of such costs, provided Ipsen chooses to opt into such trials. In accordance with the collaboration agreement, Ipsen has opted into and is co-funding: CheckMate 9ER, subject to re-confirmation following the protocol amendment; CheckMate 040 (except for the triplet arm of the study evaluating cabozantinib with nivolumab and ipilimumab); and the phase 1b trial evaluating cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors being conducted in collaboration with Roche. 
We remain responsible for the manufacture and supply of cabozantinib for all development and commercialization activities under the collaboration agreement. In connection with the collaboration agreement, we entered into a supply agreement with Ipsen in February 2016, which, pursuant to its amended terms, effective October 2017, we will supply finished, labeled drug product to Ipsen for distribution in the territories outside of the U.S. and Japan, indefinitely.
Unless terminated earlier, the collaboration agreement has a term that continues, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latter of (i) the expiration of patent claims related to cabozantinib, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity covering cabozantinib or (iii) ten years after the first commercial sale of cabozantinib, other than COMETRIQ. The supply agreement will continue in effect until expiration or termination of the collaboration agreement. The collaboration agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on uncured material breach of either the collaboration agreement or the supply agreement by the other party, bankruptcy of the other party or for safety reasons. We may terminate the collaboration agreement if Ipsen challenges or opposes any patent covered by the collaboration agreement. Ipsen may terminate the collaboration agreement if the FDA or EMA orders or requires substantially all cabozantinib clinical trials to be terminated. Ipsen also has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement on a region-by-region basis after the first commercial sale of cabozantinib in advanced RCC in the given region. Upon termination by either party, all licenses granted by us to Ipsen will automatically terminate, and, except in the event of a termination by Ipsen for our material breach, the licenses granted by Ipsen to us shall survive such termination and shall automatically become worldwide, or, if Ipsen terminated only for a particular region, then for the terminated region. Following termination by us for Ipsen’s material breach, or termination by Ipsen without cause or because we undergo a change of control by a party engaged in a competing program, Ipsen is prohibited from competing with us for a period of time.
17

Takeda Collaboration
In January 2017, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Takeda for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib in Japan. Pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement, Takeda has exclusive commercialization rights for current and potential future cabozantinib indications in Japan. The parties have also agreed to collaborate on the future clinical development of cabozantinib in Japan. The operation and strategic direction of the parties’ collaboration is governed through a joint executive committee and appropriate subcommittees.
In consideration for the exclusive license and other rights contained in the collaboration agreement, we received a $50.0 million upfront nonrefundable payment from Takeda. We are eligible to receive development, regulatory and first-sale milestone payments of up to $95.0 million related to second-line RCC, first-line RCC and second-line HCC, as well as additional development, regulatory and first-sale milestones payments for potential future indications. The collaboration agreement also provides that we are eligible to receive pre-specified payments of up to $83.0 million associated with potential sales milestones. We will also receive royalties on net sales of cabozantinib in Japan. We are entitled to receive a tiered royalty of 15% to 24% on the initial $300.0 million of net sales, and following this initial $300.0 million of net sales, we are then entitled to receive a tiered royalty of 20% to 30% on annual net sales. These tiers will reset each calendar year.
Takeda is responsible for 20% of the costs associated with the global cabozantinib development plan’s current and future trials, provided Takeda opts into such trials, and 100% of costs associated with the cabozantinib development activities that are exclusively for the benefit of Japan. Pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement, we are responsible for the manufacture and supply of cabozantinib for all development and commercialization activities under the collaboration, and consequently, we entered into a clinical supply agreement covering the manufacture and supply of cabozantinib to Takeda. 
Unless earlier terminated, the collaboration agreement has a term that continues, on a product-by-product basis, until the earlier of (i) two years after first generic entry with respect to such product in Japan or (ii) the later of (A) the expiration of patent claims related to cabozantinib and (B) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity covering cabozantinib in Japan. The collaboration agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on uncured material breach by the other party, bankruptcy of the other party or for safety reasons. For clarity, Takeda’s failure to achieve specified levels of commercial performance, based upon sales volume and/or promotional effort, during the first six years of the collaboration will constitute a material breach of the collaboration agreement. We may terminate the agreement if Takeda challenges or opposes any patent covered by the collaboration agreement. At any time prior to August 1, 2023, the parties may mutually agree to terminate the collaboration agreement if Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency is unlikely to grant any approval of the marketing authorization application, or MAA, in any cancer indication in Japan. After the commercial launch of cabozantinib in Japan, Takeda may terminate the collaboration agreement upon twelve months’ prior written notice following the third anniversary of the first commercial sale of cabozantinib in Japan. Upon termination by either party, all licenses granted by us to Takeda will automatically terminate, and the licenses granted by Takeda to us shall survive such termination and shall automatically become worldwide.
Cobimetinib Collaboration
In December 2006, we out-licensed the further development and commercialization of cobimetinib to Genentech pursuant to a worldwide collaboration agreement. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we were responsible for developing cobimetinib through the determination of the MTD in a phase 1 clinical trial, and Genentech had the option to co-develop cobimetinib, which Genentech could exercise after receipt of certain phase 1 data from us. In March 2008, Genentech exercised its option to co-develop cobimetinib, and in March 2009, we granted to Genentech an exclusive worldwide revenue-bearing license to cobimetinib, at which point Genentech became responsible for completing the phase 1 clinical trial and subsequent clinical development. We received aggregate upfront and milestone payments of $50.0 million under our collaboration agreement with Genentech and are not eligible for any additional milestone payments.
On November 10, 2015, the FDA approved cobimetinib, under the brand name COTELLIC, in combination with Zelboraf as a treatment for patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive advanced melanoma. COTELLIC in combination with Zelboraf has also been approved in Switzerland, the EU, Canada, Australia, Brazil and multiple additional countries for use in the same indication. Prior to the FDA’s approval of COTELLIC, in November 2013, we exercised an option under the collaboration agreement to co-promote COTELLIC in the U.S., which allows for us to provide up to 25% of the total sales force for approved cobimetinib indications in the U.S. Between November 2015 and December 2017, we fielded 25% of the sales force promoting COTELLIC in combination with Zelboraf as a treatment for patients with BRAF mutation-
18

positive advanced melanoma in the U.S. However, following a recent commercial review, commencing in January 2018, we and Genentech scaled back the personal promotion of COTELLIC in this indication in the U.S. This decision is not indicative of any change in our intention to promote COTELLIC for other therapeutic indications for which it may be approved in the future. 
Under the terms of our collaboration agreement, as amended in July 2017, we share in the profits and losses received or incurred in connection with COTELLIC’s commercialization in the U.S. This profit and loss share has multiple tiers: we receive 50% of profits and losses from the first $200.0 million of U.S. actual sales, decreasing to 30% of profits and losses from U.S. actual sales in excess of $400.0 million. These tiers will reset each calendar year. The revenue for each sale of COTELLIC applied to the profit and loss statement for the collaboration agreement, or the Genentech Collaboration P&L, is calculated using the average of the quarterly net selling prices of COTELLIC and any additional branded Genentech product(s) prescribed with COTELLIC in such sale. U.S. commercialization costs for COTELLIC are then applied to the Genentech Collaboration P&L, subject to reduction based on the number of Genentech products in any given combination including COTELLIC. In addition to our profit share in the U.S., under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we are entitled to low double-digit royalties on net sales of COTELLIC outside the U.S. 
Unless earlier terminated, the collaboration agreement has a term that continues until the expiration of the last payment obligation with respect to the licensed products under the collaboration. Genentech has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement without cause at any time. If Genentech terminates the collaboration agreement without cause, all licenses that were granted to Genentech under the agreement terminate and revert to us. Additionally, if Genentech terminates the collaboration agreement without cause, or we terminate the collaboration agreement for cause, we would receive, subject to certain conditions, licenses from Genentech to research, develop and commercialize reverted product candidates. The collaboration agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on uncured material breach by the other party.
Other Collaborations
Prior to the commercialization of our first product, COMETRIQ, our primary business strategy was focused on the development and out-license of compounds to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies under collaboration agreements that allowed us to retain economic participation in compounds and support additional development of our proprietary products. Our collaboration agreements with Daiichi Sankyo, Merck, BMS and Sanofi described below are representative of this historical strategy. We have since evolved and are now a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on maximizing the opportunity for our two internally discovered compounds, cabozantinib and cobimetinib, to improve care and outcomes for people with cancer around the world. While our historical collaboration agreements described below have the potential to provide meaningful future revenue in the aggregate, we do not expect to receive substantial revenues from these historical collaboration agreements unless and until our partnered compounds enter late-stage clinical development and/or receive marketing approval from the FDA, if ever, when the milestone payments, royalties or other rights and benefits under our historical collaboration agreements become more substantial and material to our business.
With respect to our partnered compounds, other than cabozantinib and cobimetinib, we are eligible to receive potential contingent payments totaling approximately $1.9 billion in the aggregate on a non-risk adjusted basis, of which 9% are related to clinical development milestones, 49% are related to regulatory milestones and 42% are related to commercial milestones, all to be achieved by the various collaborators, which may not be paid, if at all, until certain conditions are met. Since we do not control the research, development or commercialization of any of our other partnered compounds that would generate these milestones, we are not able to reasonably estimate when, if at all, any milestone payments or royalties may be payable by our collaborators. In addition, most of the collaborations for our other partnered compounds are at early stages of development. Successfully developing a product candidate, obtaining regulatory approval and ultimately commercializing it is a significantly lengthy and highly uncertain process which entails a significant risk of failure. In addition, business combinations, changes in a collaborator’s business strategy and financial difficulties or other factors could result in a collaborator abandoning or delaying development of a partnered compound. As such, the remaining potential contingent payments associated with our historical collaboration agreements involve a substantial degree of risk to achieve and may never be received. Accordingly, we do not expect, and investors should not assume, that we will receive all of the potential contingent payments described above and it is possible that we may never receive any additional significant milestone or other payments under these historical collaboration agreements.

Daiichi Sankyo
In March 2006, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo for the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies targeted against the mineralocorticoid receptor, or MR, a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in a variety of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted to Daiichi Sankyo an exclusive, worldwide license to certain intellectual property primarily relating to compounds that modulate MR, including CS-3150/esaxerenone (a specific rotational isomer of XL550). Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for all further preclinical and clinical development, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization activities for the compounds and we do not have rights to reacquire such compounds, except as described below.
During the research term, which concluded in November 2007, we jointly identified drug candidates with Daiichi Sankyo for further development. For each product from the collaboration, we are entitled to receive payments upon attainment of pre-specified development, regulatory and commercialization milestones. As of December 31, 2017, we have received an aggregate of $25.5 million in development milestone payments related to CS-3150, an oral, non-steroidal, selective MR antagonist over there life of the collaboration agreement. In September 2017, Daiichi Sankyo reported positive top-line results from the phase 3 pivotal trial of CS-3150/esaxerenone and communicated its intention to submit a Japanese regulatory application for CS-3150/esaxerenone for an essential hypertension indication in the first quarter of 2018. We are eligible to receive additional development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments of up to $130.0 million. In addition, we are entitled to receive royalties on any sales of certain products commercialized under the collaboration. Daiichi Sankyo may terminate the agreement upon ninety days’ written notice in which case Daiichi Sankyo’s payment obligations would cease, its license relating to compounds that modulate MR would terminate and revert to us and we would receive, subject to certain terms and conditions, licenses from Daiichi Sankyo to research, develop and commercialize compounds that were discovered under the collaboration. 
Merck
In December 2011, we entered into an agreement with Merck pursuant to which we granted Merck an exclusive worldwide license to our phosphoinositide-3 kinase-delta, or PI3K-d, program, including XL499 and other related compounds. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Merck has sole responsibility to research, develop, and commercialize compounds from our PI3K-d program. In July 2015 we received a $3.0 million milestone payment from Merck in connection with Merck’s selection of a compound from our PI3K-d program to advance into clinical trials and in April 2016, we received a milestone payment of $5.0 million in connection with the initiation of a phase 1 clinical trial for the compound. We will be eligible to receive additional payments associated with the successful achievement of potential development and regulatory milestones for multiple indications of up to $231.0 million. We will also be eligible to receive payments for combined sales performance milestones of up to $375.0 million and royalties on net-sales of products emerging from the agreement. 
Merck may at any time, upon specified prior notice to us, terminate the license. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach. In the event of termination by Merck at will or by us for Merck’s uncured material breach, the license granted to Merck would terminate. In the event of a termination by us for Merck’s uncured material breach, we would receive a royalty-free license from Merck to develop and commercialize certain joint products. In the event of termination by Merck for our uncured material breach, Merck would retain the licenses from us, and we would receive reduced royalties from Merck on commercial sales of products.
BMS - ROR Collaboration Agreement 
In October 2010, we entered into a worldwide collaboration with BMS pursuant to which each party granted to the other certain intellectual property licenses to enable the parties to discover, optimize and characterize ROR antagonists that may subsequently be developed and commercialized by BMS. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we were responsible for activities related to the discovery, optimization and characterization of the ROR antagonists during the collaborative research period which began on October 8, 2010 and ended on July 8, 2013. Since the end of the collaborative research period, BMS has and will continue to have sole responsibility for any further research, development, manufacture and commercialization of products developed under the collaboration and will bear all costs and expenses associated with those activities. 
For each product developed by BMS under the collaboration, we will be eligible to receive payments upon the achievement by BMS of development and regulatory milestones. As of December 31, 2017, we have earned aggregate development and regulatory milestones of $12.5 million, including a $2.5 million development milestone payment in February 2017 in connection with the achievement of certain preclinical milestones set forth in the collaboration agreement and a $10.0 million regulatory milestone payment in October 2017 in connection with BMS’s filing of a Clinical Trial 
20

Authorization in Europe for a first in-human study of an RORγ inverse agonist. We are eligible for additional development and regulatory milestone payment of up to $240.0 million in the aggregate and commercialization milestones of up to $150.0 million in the aggregate, as well as royalties on commercial net sales, depending on the advancement of the product candidate and eventual product.
The collaboration agreement was amended and restated in April 2011 in connection with an assignment of patents to a wholly-owned subsidiary. BMS may, at any time, terminate the collaboration agreement upon certain prior notice to us on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach. In the event of termination by BMS at will or by us for BMS’s uncured material breach, the license granted to BMS would terminate, the right to such product would revert to us and we would receive a royalty-bearing license for late-stage reverted compounds and a royalty-free license for early-stage reverted compounds from BMS to develop and commercialize such product in the related country. In the event of termination by BMS for our uncured material breach, BMS would retain the right to such product, subject to continued payment of milestones and royalties.
Sanofi
In May 2009, we entered into a global license agreement with Sanofi for SAR245408 (XL147) and SAR245409 (XL765), leading inhibitors of phosphoinositide-3 kinase, or PI3K, and a broad collaboration for the discovery of inhibitors of PI3K for the treatment of cancer. The license agreement and collaboration agreement became effective on July 7, 2009. Under the license agreement, Sanofi received a worldwide exclusive license to SAR245408 (XL147) and SAR245409 (XL765), which entered into a series of phase 1, phase 1b/2 or phase 2 clinical trials, and has sole responsibility, including funding, for all subsequent clinical, regulatory, commercial and manufacturing activities. We were notified by Sanofi that the initial clinical trials involving XL147 or XL765 have been terminated or are in the process of concluding, and that Sanofi is still considering whether to initiate any further trials. We will be eligible to receive contingent payments associated with development, regulatory and commercial milestones under the license agreement of $745.0 million in the aggregate, as well as royalties on sales of any products commercialized under the license. Sanofi may, upon certain prior notice to us, terminate the license as to products containing SAR245408 (XL147) and SAR245409 (XL765). In the event of such termination election, Sanofi’s license relating to such product would terminate and revert to us, and we would receive, subject to certain terms, conditions and potential payment obligations, licenses from Sanofi to research, develop and commercialize such products.
In December 2011, we entered into an agreement with Sanofi pursuant to which the parties terminated the discovery collaboration agreement and released each other from any potential liabilities arising under the collaboration agreement prior to effectiveness of the termination in December 2011. Each party retains ownership of the intellectual property that it generated under the collaboration agreement, and we granted Sanofi covenants not-to-enforce with respect to certain of our intellectual property rights. If either party or its affiliate or licensee develops and commercializes a therapeutic product containing an isoform-selective PI3K inhibitor that arose from such party’s work (or was derived from such work) under the collaboration agreement, then such party will be obligated to pay royalties to the other party based upon the net sales of such products. The termination agreement provides that Sanofi will make a one-time payment to us upon the first receipt by Sanofi or its affiliate or licensee of marketing approval for the first therapeutic product containing an isoform-selective PI3K inhibitor that arose from Sanofi’s work (or was derived from such work) under the collaboration agreement.
Manufacturing and Product Supply
We do not own or operate manufacturing or distribution facilities or resources for clinical or commercial production and distribution of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ. Instead, we have multiple contractual agreements in place with third-party contract manufacturing organizations who, on our behalf, manufacture clinical and commercial supplies of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ. This will continue in the foreseeable future for both our current and future commercial products. We have selected well-established and reputable global third-party contract manufacturers for our drug substance and drug product manufacturing that have good regulatory standing, large manufacturing capacities and multiple manufacturing sites within their business footprint. These third parties must comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practices the EC’s Guidelines on Good Distribution Practice, as well as other stringent regulatory requirements enforced by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, as applicable, and are subject to routine inspections by such regulatory agencies. We monitor and evaluate the performance of our third-party contract manufacturers on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance with these requirements and to affirm their continuing capabilities to meet both our commercial and clinical needs. We also have contracted with a third-party logistics provider, with multiple distribution locations, to provide shipping and warehousing services for our commercial supply of both 
21

CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in the U.S. We employ highly skilled personnel with both technical and manufacturing experience to diligently manage the activities at our third-party contract manufacturers, and our quality department audits them on a periodic basis. 
We source raw materials that are used to manufacture our drug substance from multiple third-party suppliers in Asia and Europe. We stock sufficient quantities of these materials and provide them to our third-party drug substance contract manufacturers to ensure they can manufacture adequate drug substance quantities per our requirements, for both clinical and commercial purposes. We then store drug substance at third-party facilities and provide appropriate amounts to our third-party drug product contract manufacturers, who then manufacture, package and label our specified quantities of finished goods for COMETRIQ and CABOMETYX, respectively. In addition, we rely on our third-party contract manufacturers to source materials such as excipients, components and reagents, which are required to manufacture our drug substance and finished drug product.
Within our supply chain, we have established safety stock amounts for both our drug substance and drug products, and store these quantities in multiple locations. The quantities that we store are based on our business needs and take into account scenarios for market demand, production lead times, potential supply interruptions and shelf life for our drug substance and drug products. In parallel, for business continuity reasons, we are in the process of evaluating and expect to establish additional suppliers for our drug substance and drug product manufacturers soon. We believe that our current manufacturing network has the appropriate capacity to produce sufficient commercial quantities of CABOMETYX to support the currently approved advanced RCC indications, as well as potential indications, including previously treated HCC, if those indications prove to be successful and gain regulatory approval in the future.
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
We have a fully integrated commercial team consisting of sales, marketing, market access, and commercial operations functions. Our sales team promotes CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in the U.S. In addition, although we currently do not co-promote COTELLIC alongside Genentech, we have the right to do so and will do so if we, in consultation with Genentech, deem it useful and appropriate to realize COTELLIC’s commercial objectives. We use customary pharmaceutical company practices to market our products in the U.S. and concentrate our efforts on oncologists, oncology nurses and pharmacists. Our finished products of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ are sold initially through wholesale distribution and specialty pharmacy channels and then, if applicable, resold to hospitals and other organizations that provide CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ to end-user patients. To facilitate our commercial activities in the U.S., we also employ various third-party vendors, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and other sales-support related services as needed. We believe that our commercial team and distribution practices are sufficient to ensure our marketing efforts reach our target audience and deliver our products to patients in a timely and compliant fashion.
In addition, we rely on Ipsen and Takeda for the commercialization and distribution of CABOMETYX in territories outside of the U.S., as well as for access and distribution activities for the approved products under named patient use programs or similar programs with the effect of introducing earlier patient access to CABOMETYX, and we also rely on Ipsen for these same activities with respect to the commercialization and distribution of COMETRIQ outside of the U.S. For COTELLIC, we rely on Genentech, as our collaboration partner, for all current and future commercialization and marketing activities, with the exception of the limited co-promotion activities highlighted above.
To help ensure that all eligible patients in the U.S. have appropriate access to CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, we have established a comprehensive reimbursement and patient support program called Exelixis Access Services, or EASE. Through EASE, we provide co-pay assistance to qualified, commercially insured patients to help minimize out-of-pocket costs and provide free drug to uninsured or under-insured patients who meet certain clinical and financial criteria. In addition, EASE is designed to provide comprehensive reimbursement support services, such as prior authorization support, benefits investigation and, if needed, appeals support.
Seasonal Operations and Backlog
Sales of our marketed products do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality.
The markets in which we operate are characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs. We do not believe that backlog information is material to our business as a whole.
22

Environment, Health and Safety
In support of the development and expansion of our product pipeline, we have resumed discovery activities. Our research and development processes involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials and chemicals. We are subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. While we have incurred, and may continue to incur, expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations, we do not expect the cost of complying with these laws and regulations to be material.
Government Regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution, export, import, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products.
The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

• | preclinical laboratory and animal tests that must be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices;


• | submission of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug candidate for its intended use;


• | submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, to FDA for commercial marketing, or of a sNDA, for approval of a new indication if the product is already approved for another indication;


• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, and Good Clinical Practices;


• | if FDA convenes an advisory committee, satisfactory completion of the advisory committee review; and


• | FDA approval of the NDA or sNDA.

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and provide its informed consent form before the trial commences at that center. Regulatory authorities or an institutional review board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.

• | Phase 1 - Studies, which involve the initial introduction of an IND into humans, are initially conducted in a limited number of subjects to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or patients.


• | Phase 2 - Studies are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specified disease in order to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 studies are typically well controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects. In some cases, a sponsor may decide to run what is referred to as a “phase 2b” evaluation, which is a second, confirmatory phase 2 trial that could, if positive, serve as a pivotal trial in the approval of a product candidate.


• | Phase 3 - When phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, phase 3 trials are performed to gather the additional information about effectiveness

23

and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide replicate statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites.
The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after a drug receives approval. Failure to satisfy such post-marketing commitments can result in FDA enforcement action, up to and including withdrawal of NDA approval. The results of phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information to augment the FDA’s adverse drug reaction reporting system. The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, or as part of an sNDA. The submission of an NDA or sNDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on NDA review questions. Although the FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of an advisory committee, the agency usually does so. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA or sNDA by way of a Complete Response letter if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data and/or an additional phase 3 pivotal clinical trial. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or sNDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. An NDA may be approved with significant restrictions on its labeling, marketing and distribution under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory standards are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
Satisfaction of FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates or new diseases for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. The FDA or any other regulatory agency may not grant approvals for new indications for our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. Success in early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical trials. Targets and pathways identified in vitro may be determined to be less relevant in clinical studies and results in animal model studies may not be predictive of human clinical results. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs, including restricting the promotion of uses for which a drug is not approved by the agency. Not only must a company have appropriate substantiation to support claims made about a drug, under the FDA’s current interpretation of the relevant laws, a company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are for indications for which FDA has approved the drug and that are otherwise consistent with the FDA-approved label for the drug. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturers’ communications on the subject of off-label use. Additionally, a significant number of pharmaceutical companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various U.S. federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of products for off-label uses and other sales practices. These investigations have alleged violations of various U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, false claims laws, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, anti-kickback laws, and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement.

In the U.S., the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, as amended, is intended to incentivize the development of drugs and biological products for rare diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. (or that affects more than 200,000 persons in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug in the U.S. for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the drug in the U.S.). If a drug is being developed for a rare disease of condition, to be eligible for designation as an orphan drug, the FDA must not have previously approved a drug considered the “same drug,” as defined in the FDA’s orphan drug regulations, for the same orphan-designated indication. If the FDA has previously approved another same drug for the same indication, to obtain orphan drug designation, the sponsor of the subsequent drug would be required to provide a plausible hypothesis of clinical superiority over the previously approved drug to obtain an orphan designation. Upon FDA receipt of Orphan Drug Designation, the sponsor is eligible for tax credits of up to 50% for qualified clinical trial expenses, the ability to apply for grant funding, and waiver of the PDUFA application fee. Following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, for clinical trial expenses incurred in tax years 2018 and going forward, the tax credit is reduced to 25%. In addition, upon marketing approval, an orphan-designated drug could be eligible for seven years of market exclusivity for the approved orphan-designated indication. Such orphan drug exclusivity, if awarded, would only block the approval of any drug considered the same drug for the same orphan indication. Moreover, a subsequent same drug could break a previously approved drug’s orphan exclusivity through a demonstration of clinical superiority over the previously approved drug.
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for developing and reviewing promising drugs, or to provide for the approval of a drug on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give drugs that treat serious conditions and that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months of NDA filing as compared to a standard review time of 10 months from NDA filing. Certain other types of drug applications are also eligible for priority review. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the clinically meaningful outcome as predicted by the surrogate marker trial. In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs, the FDA also designates Breakthrough Therapy status to drugs that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives: intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and rolling review.
Additional programs intended to expedite the development of drug products were included in the recently enacted 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act. Signed into law on December 13, 2016, the Cures Act includes various provisions to accelerate the development and delivery of new treatments, such as those intended to expand the types of evidence manufacturers may bring to the FDA to support drug approval, to encourage patient-centered drug development, to liberalize the communication of healthcare economic information, or HCEI, to payers, and to create greater transparency with regard to manufacturer expanded access programs. Central to the Cures Act are provisions that enhance and accelerate the FDA’s processes for reviewing and approving new drugs and supplements to approved NDAs, including provisions that:

• | require the FDA to establish a program to evaluate the potential use of real world evidence to help to support the approval of a new indication for an approved drug and to help to support or satisfy post-approval study requirements;


• | provide that the FDA may rely upon qualified data summaries to support the approval of a supplemental application with respect to a qualified indication for an already approved drug;


• | require FDA to issue guidance for purposes of assisting sponsors in incorporating complex adaptive and other novel trial designs into proposed clinical protocols and applications for new drugs; and

25


• | require FDA to establish a process for the qualification of drug development tools for use in supporting or obtaining FDA approval for or investigational use of a drug.

As to dissemination of HCEI, the Cures Act amends Section 114 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 to help clarify and facilitate the dissemination of HCEI, including by broadening the definition of HCEI, expressly extending the dissemination of HCEI to payors, and clarifying that HCEI must only “relate” to an FDA-approved indication rather than “directly” relate to the indication.
The Hatch-Waxman Act 
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, established two abbreviated approval pathways for drug products in which potential competitors may rely upon the FDA’s prior approval of the same or similar drug product.
ANDA. An Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, may be approved by the FDA if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed generic product is the same as the approved drug, which is referred to as the Reference Listed Drug, or RLD. Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and RLD (1) have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, (2) are intended for the same uses, and (3) are bioequivalent. This is instead of independently demonstrating the proposed product’s safety and effectiveness, which are inferred from the fact that the product is the same as the RLD, which the FDA previously found to be safe and effective. Furthermore, conducting bioequivalence testing is generally less time consuming and costly than conducting a full set of clinical trials in humans.
505(b)(2) NDAs. A 505(b)(2) application is one for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. Under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, an applicant may rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application. If the 505(b)(2) applicant establishes that reliance on FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies. The FDA may require additional studies or measurements, including comparability studies.
Unlike a full NDA for which the sponsor has conducted or obtained a right of reference to all the data essential to approval, the filing of both an ANDA application and a 505(b)(2) application may be delayed due to patent or exclusivity protections covering an approved product. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five years of data exclusivity for the first approval of a new chemical entity, and three years of data exclusivity for supplemental applications containing clinical studies essential to the approval of the sNDA.
Orange Book Listing. An NDA sponsor must identify to the FDA patents that claim the drug substance or drug product or approved method of using the drug. When the drug is approved, those patents are among the information about the product that is listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, which is referred to as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA must certify, for each patent listed in the Orange Book for the RLD that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA, (2) such patent has expired, (3) the listed patent will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration, or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The fourth certification described above is known as a Paragraph IV certification. A notice of the Paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the reference NDA holder. The reference NDA holder and patent owners may initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the Paragraph IV notice. Filing such a lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of the Paragraph IV certification notice prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the RLD has expired. We intend to defend vigorously any patents for our approved products. 
Regulation Outside of the United States 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and the manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products outside of the U.S. Whether or not we obtain FDA 
26

approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the EU, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
The way clinical trials are conducted in the EU will undergo a major change when Regulation (EU) 536/2014 governing clinical trials in the EU, repealing the existing Directive 2001/20/EC comes into application in 2019. This regulation harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU, via an EU portal and database. The EMA will set up and maintain the portal and database, in collaboration with the Member States and the EC.
Under EU regulatory systems, a company may submit MAAs either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. Under the centralized procedure, MAAs are submitted to the EMA whose Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use reviews the application and issues an opinion on it. The opinion is considered by the EC which is responsible for deciding applications. If the application is approved, the EC grants a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, collectively the European Economic Area, or the EEA. The national authorization procedures, the decentralized and mutual recognition procedures, as well as national applications, are available for products for which the centralized procedure is not compulsory. The mutual recognition procedure provides for the EU member states selected by the applicant to mutually recognize a national marketing authorization that has already been granted by the competent authority of another member state, referred to as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The decentralized procedure is used when the product in question has yet to be granted a marketing authorization in any member state. Under this procedure the applicant can select the member state that will act as the RMS. In both the mutual recognition and decentralized procedures, the RMS reviews the application and submits its assessment of the application to the member states where marketing authorizations are being sought, referred to as Concerned Member States or CMS. Within 90 days of receiving the application and assessment report, each CMS must decide whether to recognize the RMS assessment. If a member state does not agree with the assessment, and the disputed points cannot be resolved the matter is eventually referred to the Coordination Group on Mutual Recognition and Decentralised procedures in the first instance to reach an agreement and failing to reach such an agreement, a referral to the EMA and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for arbitration that will result in an opinion to form the basis of a decision to be issued by the EC binding on all member states. If the application is successful national marketing authorizations will be granted by the competent authorities in each of the member states chosen by the applicant.
Conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for a limited number of medicinal products for human use referenced in EU law applicable to conditional marketing authorizations where the clinical dataset is not comprehensive, if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Specific obligations, such as the completion of ongoing or new studies and obligations relating to the collection of pharmacovigilance data, may be amongst the conditions stipulated in the marketing authorization. 
As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product as an Orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. In the EU orphan designation is available for products in development which are either: (a) intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU, or (b) intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the Community and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. Additionally, the sponsor of an application for orphan drug designation must establish that there exists no satisfactory authorized method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition or even if such treatment exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
Orphan drugs in the EU enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product. The period of market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year it is established that the criteria for orphan designation are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
27

Healthcare Regulation 
Federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, also apply to our business. If we fail to comply with those laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, which prohibits. among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third‑party payers that are false or fraudulent. Additionally, we are subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of whether the payer is a federal healthcare program, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicate compliance efforts.
Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information, are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we obtain and/or disclose individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity, including healthcare providers, in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business. International laws, such as the EU Data Privacy Directive (95/46/EC) and Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, regulate the processing of personal data within the EU and between countries in the EU and countries outside of the EU, including the U.S. On April 27, 2016, the EU legislature adopted Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR will replace Directive 95/46/EC when it takes effect on May 25, 2018, and it will apply in all Member States without the need for implementing national legislation, as well as extra-territorially outside the EU. Furthermore, in October 2015, the Court of Justice of the EU declared the previous framework, the International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, or Safe Harbor, invalid for data transfer between the U.S. and the EU. The Safe Harbor has now been replaced by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, a framework for transatlantic exchanges of personal data for commercial purposes between the EU and the U.S. in accordance with the principles of the GDPR.  Accordingly, there may be an immediate impact on companies located in the U.S. as they devote resources to comply with these new obligations. The GDPR establishes a tiered approach to penalties for breach which enables the data protection authorities of the various Member States to impose fines for certain infringements, including the breach of requirements relating to international transfers or the basic principles for processing of personal data (such as conditions for obtaining consent from that individual whose data is being transferred). The severity of these fines may be up to the higher of 4% of annual worldwide revenue or €20 million.
In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the PPACA, created a federal requirement under the federal Open Payments program, that requires certain manufacturers to track and report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services annually certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. In addition, there are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
For those marketed products which are covered in the U.S. by the Medicaid programs, we have various obligations, including government price reporting and rebate requirements, which generally require products be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to Medicaid and certain purchasers (including “covered entities” purchasing under the 340B Drug Discount Program). We are also required to discount such products to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements apply. These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the guidance governing 
28

such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties. Subject to the application in the EU of the Transparency Directive 89/105/EEC, which aims to ensure the transparency of measures adopted to control pricing and reimbursement, pricing and reimbursement in the EU/EEA is governed by national rules and policy and may vary from Member State to Member State.
Reimbursement 
Sales of our approved products and any future products of ours will depend, in part, on the extent to which their costs will be covered by third-party payers, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Patients may be less likely to use our products if coverage is not provided and reimbursement is inadequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. In addition, although to date qualified patients who would not otherwise be able to afford our products have been able to receive financial support from us in some cases, and from independent patient support foundations in other cases, these programs have recently been subject to significant government scrutiny, and in the future these patients may no longer be able to use our products. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a third-party payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Additionally, a third-party payer’s decision to cover a particular drug product does not ensure that other payers will also provide coverage for the drug product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.
In the U.S. and other potentially significant markets for our products, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which may result in lower average selling prices. In some cases, for example, third-party payers try to encourage the use of less expensive generic products through their prescription benefits coverage and reimbursement and co-pay policies. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the U.S. and on country-specific and national pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing coverage and/or reimbursement controls and measures, could have a material adverse impact on our net product revenues and results of operations.
The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering proposals or have enacted legislative and regulatory changes the healthcare system that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. There has been particular and increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to drug pricing practices, particularly with respect to drugs that have been subject to relatively large price increases over relatively short time periods. At the federal level, there have been several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has already been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, for example, the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA recently have been enacted. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 23, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, 
29

and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. It is expected that Congress will continue to consider legislation to repeal and replace some or all elements of the PPACA. We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing, which could have a negative impact on our revenue or sales of any products or future approved products.
Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Such laws, and others that may affect our business that have been recently enacted or may in the future be enacted, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. In the future, there will likely continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit coverage and reimbursement of drug products, including our approved products and any future approved products. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.
In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before its cost may be funded within the respective national healthcare system. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, EU member states may restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national healthcare systems provide reimbursement and may control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profits the medicinal product generates for the company placing it on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products on cost-effectiveness grounds. Historically, products launched in countries in the EU do not follow the price structures of the U.S. and they generally tend to be priced significantly lower.

There are many companies focused on the development of small molecules and antibodies for cancer. Our competitors and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic research institutions, clinical reference laboratories and government agencies that are pursuing research activities similar to ours. Many of the organizations competing with us have greater capital resources, larger research and development staff and facilities, more experience in obtaining regulatory approvals and more extensive product manufacturing and commercial capabilities than we do, which may allow them to have a competitive advantage.
Competition for Cabozantinib
We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:

• | efficacy, safety and reliability of cabozantinib;


• | timing and scope of regulatory approval;


• | the speed at which we develop cabozantinib for the treatment of additional tumor types beyond its approved indications;


• | our ability to complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for cabozantinib;


• | our ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of cabozantinib product to the market;


• | our ability to successfully commercialize cabozantinib and secure coverage and adequate reimbursement in approved indications;


• | product acceptance by physicians and other health care providers;


• | the level of our collaboration partners’ investments in the resources necessary to successfully commercialize cabozantinib in territories where it is approved outside of the U.S.;


• | skills of our employees and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees;


• | protection of our intellectual property; and


• | the availability of substantial capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities.

We believe that the quality and breadth of activity observed with cabozantinib, the skill of our employees and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees, our patent portfolio and our capabilities for research and drug development are competitive strengths. However, many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have significantly larger intellectual property estates than we do, more substantial capital resources than we have, and greater capabilities and experience than we do in preclinical and clinical development, sales, marketing, manufacturing and regulatory affairs.
The markets for which we intend to pursue regulatory approval of cabozantinib are highly competitive. We are aware of products in research or development by our competitors that are intended to treat all of the tumor types we are targeting, and should they demonstrate suitable clinical evidence, any of these products may compete with cabozantinib. We believe our future success will depend upon our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances and the shifting landscape of therapeutic strategy following the advent of immunotherapy. CABOMETYX in particular may become less marketable if we are unable to successfully adapt our development strategy to address the fact that this recent approach to treating cancer with immune checkpoint inhibitors has and will continue to become more prevalent in indications for which CABOMETYX is approved, most notably advanced RCC, and in additional indications where we intend to seek regulatory approval, such as previously treated advanced HCC. Furthermore, the complexities of such a strategy has and may continue to require collaboration with some of our competitors.
CABOMETYX: We believe the principal competition for CABOMETYX in advanced RCC includes: BMS’s nivolumab; Pfizer’s axitinib, sunitinib and temsirolimus; Novartis’ everolimus and pazopanib; Bayer’s and Onyx Pharmaceuticals’ (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amgen) sorafenib; Genentech’s bevacizumab and atezolizumab; Eisai’s lenvatinib; and AVEO Pharmaceutical’s tivozanib. Additionally, there are a variety of combination therapies being developed for RCC, including, Roche’s bevacizumab and atezolizumab, BMS’s ipilimumab and nivolumab, Merck’s pembrolizumab and Eisai’s lenvatinib, Merck’s pembrolizumab and Pfizer’s axitinib, Pfizer’s avelumab and axitinib, Merck’s pembrolizumab and Roche’s bevacizumab, Merck’s pembrolizumab and Incyte’s epacadostat and Eisai’s lenvatinib and Novartis’ everolimus. 
The competition we currently face from BMS’s nivolumab in previously treated advanced RCC is particularly significant. Nivolumab was approved as a second-line treatment of advanced RCC on November 23, 2015, following a rapid review by the FDA. That approval was based in large part on the results of BMS’s phase 3 trial comparing nivolumab to everolimus in patients who had received previous antiangiogenic therapy for advanced RCC (CheckMate-025), in which nivolumab met its primary endpoint of showing a statistically-significant improvement in OS over everolimus, a current standard of care for the treatment of second-line RCC patients. While nivolumab failed to demonstrate a statistically-significant PFS benefit over everolimus, it demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. 
For previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC, we expect to face significant competition from BMS’s combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab, if approved by the FDA. In September 2017, BMS announced that its phase 3 study evaluating nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC (CheckMate-214) met its co-primary endpoint, demonstrating OS compared to sunitinib, the current standard of care, in intermediate-and poor-risk patients. The combination also met a secondary endpoint of improved OS versus sunitinib in all randomized patients. On the basis of this data, BMS filed a supplemental Biologics License Application, or sBLA, for use of the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab as a first-line treatment for intermediate-and poor-risk patients with advanced RCC, and in December 2017, the FDA granted a priority review to the sBLA. The FDA is scheduled to make its final decision on the sBLA on or before April 16, 2018.
COMETRIQ: We believe that the principal competing anti-cancer therapy to COMETRIQ in progressive, metastatic MTC is Genzyme’s RET, VEGFR and EGFR inhibitor vandetanib, which has been approved by the FDA and the EC for the treatment of symptomatic or progressive MTC in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease. In addition, we believe that COMETRIQ also faces competition as a treatment for progressive, metastatic MTC from off-label use of Bayer’s and Onyx Pharmaceuticals’ (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amgen) multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, Pfizer’s multikinase inhibitor sunitinib, Takeda’s multikinase inhibitor ponatinib, Novartis’ multikinase inhibitor pazopanib, and Eisai’s multikinase inhibitor lenvatinib.
Potential Cabozantinib Indications Beyond RCC and MTC, Including Advanced HCC: Based on the results of CELESTIAL, we plan to submit a sNDA to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018, for CABOMETYX as a treatment for patients with previously treated advanced HCC. However, we face a rapidly evolving treatment landscape for the treatment of advanced HCC, as other therapies have recently received regulatory approval or are in advanced stages of clinical development, which may impair the relative value of CABOMETYX for this indication. Should cabozantinib be approved for the treatment of patients with previously treated advanced HCC, we believe its principal competition may include Bayer’s regorafenib, BMS’s nivolumab, Eisai’s lenvatinib, Merck’s pembrolizumab, Lilly’s ramucirumab and AstraZeneca’s durvalumab

and tremelimumab. Examples of potential competition for cabozantinib in other cancer indications include: other VEGF pathway inhibitors, including Genentech’s bevacizumab; other RET inhibitors including Eisai’s lenvatinib and Takeda’s ponatinib; and other MET inhibitors, including Astra Zeneca’s savolitinib, Pfizer’s crizotinib and Mirati’s glesatinib; and immunotherapies such as BMS’s ipilimumab and nivolumab, Merck’s pembrolizumab and Roche’s atezolizumab.
Competition for Cobimetinib
We believe that cobimetinib’s principal competition amongst targeted agents includes Novartis’ trametinib and dabrafenib, and Array’s encorafenib and binimetinib; and within the class of immunotherapies, BMS’s ipilimumab and nivolumab and Merck’s pembrolizumab. The second category, immunotherapies, are of particular competitive importance vis-a-vis cobimetinib in advanced melanoma as they are already FDA approved in melanoma patient populations that overlap with those that may be eligible for cobimetinib, they have been rapidly incorporated into the National Comprehensive Cancer Network treatment guidelines, and they are viewed with a high degree of enthusiasm by physicians and key opinion leaders. Ongoing and future trials incorporating immune checkpoint inhibitors, including combination trials, may further impact usage of cobimetinib in melanoma and potentially in additional tumor types in which cobimetinib may ultimately gain approval.
Should cobimetinib in combination with atezolizumab be approved for the treatment of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic CRC, we believe its principal competition may include Bayer’s regorafenib, Taihio Oncology’s trifluridine and tipiracil, Lilly’s cetuximab and Amgen’s panitumumab.
