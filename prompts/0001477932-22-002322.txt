Our Industry

Micro-businesses in China are the target customers for our product. The term micro-businesses not only refers to corporate companies, but also individuals. It includes all business owners engaged in sales and marketing based on social platforms. Micro-business first emerged when social platforms just started expanding in China, and microbusiness owners were usually individual users of social platforms who used the platform as a business tool. Gradually, the expansion of social platform gave birth to various independent brands and stores which flourished on various social platforms. These brands and stores are known as micro-business owners in today’s context. As the industry matured, traditional brands and major e-commerce players joined this market as well. Micro-business as a concept gained more trust among business owners and consumers, and more business owners tried to gain market shares through micro-business channels. One difficulty they face is the limitation of technology support. Our YCloud system not only opens up new resource for micro-business, but also helps remove the technical industry entry barrier for micro-business owners. It is estimated that the number of people running micro-businesses in China will increase from 60 million in 2019 to 130 million in 2020, 200 million in 2021, 260 million in 2022 and 330 million in 2023, respectively.

Our business is in the social e-commerce area, which is based on social networking and connects suppliers and consumers in an S2B2C model to facilitate commodity circulation.

Specifically, S2B2C refers to the upstream of the distribution platform(S) that connects commodity suppliers, providing small shop owners(B) with a series of services such as supply chain, logistics, IT systems, training, after-sales, etc., and then the shop owner is responsible for the C-side product sales and user maintenance. Users use social relationships to conduct distribution without intervening in the supply chain. This distribution mode adopts the business method that features relying on existing social groups, and team compensation.

In recent years, as the scale of mobile online shopping has grown steadily, the development of micro-businesses has seen a more promising market environment. According to data from the Ministry of Commerce of PRC, in 2020, the volume of online retail sales of physical goods is 9.8 trillion yuan, an increase of 14.8%. PRC market has been the world's largest online retail market for eight consecutive years. Accordingly, the market scale of micro-business has also been expanding. According to data from iResearch, the size of market transaction in China's micro-business industry in 2016 was 328.77 billion yuan. It is expected that with the growth of demand, the transaction size of the micro-business market in 2023 will be approximately 13 trillion yuan. In addition, with the expansion of the scale of micro-business transactions, the number of domestic micro-business owners has also increased year by year. According to data from iResearch, the number of micro-business owners in China has exceeded 20 million in 2017 and is expected to reach 330 million by 2023. (Source: https://xueqiu.com/8455183447/172404679?sharetime=2)

Meanwhile, the industry competition we face should not be underestimated. Due to the low entry barriers, more micro-business owners joined the industry, utilizing online platform such as Wechat. As a result, the current market has become more crowded with homogeneous products. According to the “White Paper on the Internet Development of Mini Programs in 2019”, (Source: http://www.199it.com/archives/990835.html) as of November 2019, the number of mini programs across the entire network exceeded 4.5 million and the number of third-party service providers already exceeded 8,000. Within the WeChat system, the current top five small business third-party service providers between 2019 and 2020 were Weimob, Youzan, Dianke, BoxPay, and Tengrui, with market shares of approximately 15.3% and 7.3%, 5.3%, 3.6%, 1.0%. However, we believe that the market has not matured into a stable playfield, and we need to conduct market research continuously as many more small and medium-sized micro-business players enter the industry.


YCloud
       
We have utilized digitalization, electronic management, electronic data exchange, big data analysis, AI fission technology, revenue management and other technologies to build a strong coordination effect. We believe that our cloud technology enables us to develop a highly functional platform for micro-business users in China. We have optimized our product using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers and developed YCloud.

We believe that YCloud is the first global micro-business cloud intelligent internationalization system. It conducts multi-channel data analysis through the learning of big data and social recommendation relationships. It also provides users with AI fission and management systems and supply chain systems in order to reach a wider range of user groups. YCloud has four main functions and competitive advantages as follows:


7


Multiple integrated payment methods and payment analytics: the YCloud system provides micro-businesses and hotel owners with multiple payment methods such as Alipay, WeChat, and UnionPay. The total order amount is directly entered into the platform to collect funds in separate accounts. Using YCloud’s technology support, the micro-business owners offer multiple channels of payments to their customers, including Alipay, WeChat, and UnionPay. Meanwhile, YCloud assigns a bar code to merchandises that purchasers can then scan to pay, allowing purchasers to make payments both online and offline. This proprietary payment technology allows our customers to reduce labor costs and error rates, thus significantly improving data analysis.


· | Single-scenario payment function: although micro-business owners are provided with a multi-method payment function for their consumers through the YCloud system, micro-business owners only have a single sales channel to display. The revenue of each sale is divided by commissions, and the cost is allocated to suppliers and the handling fee to the YCloud system. The remaining balance goes to micro-business owners.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Multi-scenario payment function: micro-business owners have multiple sales channels to display and numerous channels to perform revenue sharing and profit consolidation functions. After various products are sold through different channels, the cost will be allocated to suppliers and the handling fee to the YCloud system. The remaining balance will be combined and goes to micro-business owners. 


During the year 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, many companies, including businesses traditionally operating offline, from a wide range of industries, such as tourism, catering, entertainment or retail, have opted for a micro-business model to build sales channels through online social platforms and expand business opportunities. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, consumer demand shifted, which forced business owners to expand to new markets and be present on multiple social platforms. Through continuous research on the micro-business industry, and its understanding of the relationship between people and social relationships on social platforms, YCloud develops new technology designed to meet the ever changing demand of micro-business owners across all industries

Team management: the YCloud system utilizes user marketing relationship tracking and CPS commission revenue management tools.

AI fission and management: using intelligent robots to analyze user behavior, data sharing, purchase history, and other data, the YCloud system provides tailored recommendations and displays. For example, the YCloud system connects users’ behavior across multiple apps and platforms and makes automatic recommendations based on its analysis.

Supply chain system integration: the YCloud system applies cross-platform resource integration technology. The integration allows the multi-channel output of high-quality products and creates a seamless connection between suppliers and customers. The YCloud provides a complete supply chain system integrating supply, sales, finance, and service.

Customer

Through Weijiafu, a PRC technology company, YCloud serves both corporate and individual micro-business owners. The API interface docking provides efficient, fast, and convenient access to all product inputs in upstream supply chain pools of Weijiafu’s clients. API interface docking provides a mutual channel for two platforms processing different coding systems, which allows information and data to be shared between the two platforms in a safe and secured way. For individual micro-business owners, we provide YCloud users with access to various resources, such as local community news, merchandise selection, product pool, commodities, finance, local life.

API interface docking provides a mutual channel for two platforms processing different coding systems, which allows information and data to be shared between the two platforms in a safe and secured way. For individual hotel owners, we provide YCloud users with access to various resources, such as local community news, hotel and merchandise selection, product pool, commodities, finance, local life.

Revenue Model

In the business of providing technical services and solutions via a social e-commerce platform, we are committed to providing an international cloud-based intelligence system and independently developed the “YCloud” system. We aim to provide technical and auto-billing management services to micro-business online stores in China through big data analytics, machine learning mechanisms, social network recommendations, and multi-channel data analysis.

We derive our revenue from service fees charged for transactions conducted through YCloud. We receive 2%-3.5% of the total Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, generated in the platform as a service fee through our agreement with both Weijiafu and Changtongfu, depending on the type of service and industry. Gross Merchandise Volume is a term used in online retailing to indicate a total sales monetary-value for merchandise sold through a particular marketplace over a certain time frame. We generally settle the service fee with Weijiafu and Changtongfu within the first ten days of each calendar month.

Competition

The global E-commerce SaaS industry is still growing and is in its early stage of development. We may compete against businesses in varied sectors, many of which are larger than we are and have a dominant and secure position in other industries or offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants which we do not. However, most of our competitors only have individual areas of overlap with one of our core areas, including E-commerce SaaS, Store SaaS, Cloud Service, Integrated Payment Service, and Advertising Service, but none compete at all levels.

There YCloud technology possesses several competitive advantages: 1). User marketing relationship tracking. This function is dedicated to shaping users' own private domain traffic, turning users into sharers, and reach more potential users with existing users. 2). Community AI fission and management. YCloud is a cloud intelligence system that allows all users to have socializing functions, such as group management, group fission, targeted advertising. YCloud independently researches and develops intelligent robots that can share products with users on a regular basis; 3). Supply chain system. YCloud aggregates the resources of actual users of system and categorizes them into four sections: mall CPS, financial CPS, local life, and preferred mall. YCloud shares the pooled resources to all users to strengthens the value of individual users' own merchandise and services, and allows users to provide more possibilities to their consumers; 4). Payment scenario function. YCloud system provides micro-business owners with multiple payment methods such as Alipay, WeChat, and UnionPay. The total order amount is directly entered into the platform to collect funds in separate accounts. Using YCloud’s technology support, the micro-business owners offer multiple channels of payments to their customers; 5). Live broadcast + short video system. YCloud provides users with live broadcast technology functions and short video shooting functions. YCloud users can share merchandise through live video broadcasts, allowing consumers to have a better perception of the merchandise.

Our primary competitor is China Youzan Limited, which offers online and offline merchants suites of comprehensive solutions comprising third-party payments and various SaaS products and comprehensive service through its e-commerce platform, like marketing and customer engagement tools facilitate the process of transactions between merchants and their customers. We seek to differentiate ourselves from industry participants by focusing on micro-businesses and specific business industries, the simplicity of our YCloud series, and being recognized by our brand and technology.

PRC Laws and Regulations on Taxation

Enterprise Income Tax

The Enterprise Income Tax Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “EIT Law”) was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on March 16, 2007 and became effective on January 1, 2008, and was later amended on February 24, 2017 and on December 29, 2018 separately. The Implementation Rules of the EIT Law (the “Implementation Rules”) were promulgated by the State Council on December 6, 2007 and became effective on January 1, 2008. According to the EIT Law and the Implementation Rules, enterprises are divided into resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. Resident enterprises shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises setting up institutions in the PRC shall pay enterprise income tax on the incomes obtained by such institutions in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises with no institutions in the PRC, and non-resident enterprises whose incomes having no substantial connection with their institutions in the PRC, shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in the PRC at a reduced rate of 10%.

The Arrangement between the PRC and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the “Arrangement”) was promulgated by the State Administration of Taxation (“SAT”) on August 21, 2006 and came into effect on December 8, 2006. According to the Arrangement, a company incorporated in Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at the lower rate of 5% on dividends it receives from a company incorporated in the PRC if it holds a 25% interest or more in the PRC company. The Notice on the Understanding and Identification of the Beneficial Owners in the Tax Treaty (the “Notice”) was promulgated by SAT and became effective on October 27, 2009. According to the Notice, a beneficial ownership analysis will be used based on a substance-over-form principle to determine whether or not to grant tax treaty benefits.

Yueshang Beijing and its subsidiaries are resident enterprises and pay EIT tax at the rate of 25% in the PRC. It is more likely than not that the Company and its offshore subsidiary would be treated as a non-resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes.

Value-added Tax

Pursuant to the Provisional Regulations on Value-added Tax of the PRC, or the VAT Regulations, which were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993, took effect on January 1, 1994, and were amended on November 10, 2008, February 6, 2016, and November 19, 2017, respectively, and the Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Value-added Tax of the PRC, which were promulgated by the MOF on December 25, 1993, and were amended on December 15, 2008, and October 28, 2011, respectively, entities and individuals that sell goods or labor services of processing, repair or replacement, sell services, intangible assets, or immovables, or import goods within the territory of the People’s Republic of China are taxpayers of value-added tax. The VAT rate is 17% for taxpayers selling goods, labor services, or tangible movable property leasing services or importing goods, except otherwise specified; 11% for taxpayers selling services of transportation, postal, basic telecommunications, construction and lease of immovable, selling immovable, transferring land use rights, selling and importing other specified goods including fertilizers; 6% for taxpayers selling services or intangible assets.

According to the Notice on the Adjustment to the Value-added Tax Rates issued by the SAT and the MOF on April 4, 2018, where taxpayers make VAT taxable sales or import goods, the applicable tax rates shall be adjusted from 17% to 16% and from 11% to 10%, respectively. Subsequently, the Notice on Policies for Deepening Reform of Value-added Tax was issued by the SAT, the MOF and the General Administration of Customs on March 30, 2019 and took effective on April 1, 2019, which further adjusted the applicable tax rate for taxpayers making VAT taxable sales or importing goods. The applicable tax rates shall be adjusted from 16% to 13% and from 10% to 9%, respectively. The VAT rate applicable to the company is currently 6%; the income tax rate applicable to the company is 25%. We are also eligible for receiving tax refund according to certain favorable government policies starting from 2021.

Dividend Withholding Tax

The Enterprise Income Tax Law states that since January 1, 2008, an income tax rate of 10% will normally be applicable to dividends declared to non-PRC resident investors that do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or that have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC.

Pursuant to an Arrangement Between the Mainland of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Incomes (“Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement”) and other applicable PRC laws, if a Hong Kong resident enterprise is determined by the competent PRC tax authority to have satisfied the relevant conditions and requirements under such Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement and other applicable laws, the 10% withholding tax on the dividends the Hong Kong resident enterprise receives from a PRC resident enterprise may be reduced to 5%. However, based on the Circular on Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties (the “SAT Circular 81”) issued on February 20, 2009 by SAT, if the relevant PRC tax authorities determine, in their discretion, that a company benefits from such reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement that is primarily tax-driven, such PRC tax authorities may adjust the preferential tax treatment. According to the Circular on Several Questions regarding the “Beneficial Owner” in Tax Treaties, which was issued on February 3, 2018 by the SAT and took effect on April 1, 2018, when determining the applicant’s status of the “beneficial owner” regarding tax treatments in connection with dividends, interests or royalties in the tax treaties, several factors, including without limitation, whether the applicant is obligated to pay more than 50% of his or her income in twelve months to residents in third country or region, whether the business operated by the applicant constitutes the actual business activities, and whether the counterparty country or region to the tax treaties does not levy any tax or grant tax exemption on relevant incomes or levy tax at an extremely low rate, will be taken into account, and it will be analyzed according to the actual circumstances of the specific cases. This circular further provides that applicants who intend to prove his or her status of the “beneficial owner” shall submit the relevant documents to the relevant tax bureau according to the Announcement on Issuing the Measures for the Administration of Non-Resident Taxpayers’ Enjoyment of the Treatment under Tax Agreements.

We have not commenced the application process for a Hong Kong tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority, and there is no assurance that we will be granted such a Hong Kong tax resident certificate. We have not filed required forms or materials with the relevant PRC tax authorities to prove that we should enjoy the 5% PRC withholding tax rate.
