ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Our Company
Innophos is a leading international producer of specialty ingredient solutions that deliver versatile benefits for the food, health, nutrition and industrial markets. We leverage our expertise in the science and technology of blending and formulating phosphate, mineral, enzyme and botanical based ingredients to help our customers offer products that are tasty, healthy, nutritious and economical. Headquartered in Cranbury, New Jersey, Innophos has manufacturing operations across the United States, in Canada, Mexico and China.
 Innophos combines more than a century of experience in specialty phosphate manufacturing with a broad range of other specialty nutritional ingredients. Utilizing our capabilities in consumer insight, research and product development and application expertise, we partner with our customers to provide differentiated product offerings that respond to consumer preferences and megatrends. We utilize this collaborative approach in order to attempt to generate market share gains for our customers.
Many of Innophos’ products are application-specific compounds engineered to meet customer performance requirements and are often critical to the taste, texture, performance or nutritional content of foods, beverages, pharmaceuticals, oral care products and other applications. For example, Innophos products act as flavor enhancers in beverages, electrolytes in sports drinks, texture additives in cheeses, leavening agents in baked goods, pharmaceutical excipients and cleaning agents in toothpaste, and they also provide a wide range of nutritional fortification solutions for food, beverage and nutritional supplement manufacturers.
Innophos’ product offering includes a wide array of botanical, enzyme and mineral based nutritional ingredients. These products have various applications in the food, beverage and dietary supplement end markets such as weight management, men and women health, digestive health, and cognitive health among others. Innophos’ 2017 acquisitions of Novel Ingredients and NutraGenesis substantially expanded Innophos’ portfolio of nutritional ingredients, which is a market that Innophos intends to continue to target for future growth of its food, health and nutrition segment.
Innophos commenced operations as an independent company in August 2004 after purchasing its North American specialty phosphates business from affiliates of Rhodia, S.A., or Rhodia, which has been a part of Solvay S.A. since 2011. In November 2006, Innophos completed an initial public offering and listed its common stock for trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “IPHS”.
Our Segments and Products 
We report our business in three segments: Food, Health and Nutrition; Industrial Specialties; and Other. We have three principal product lines within these reporting segments: (i) Specialty Ingredients; (ii) Core Ingredients; and (iii) Co-Products and Other. Our Food, Health and Nutrition reporting segment as well as our Industrial Specialties reporting segment consist of products in the Specialty Ingredients and Core Ingredients product lines. The Other reporting segment consists of products in the Co-Products and Other product line. 
In 2018, we achieved sales of $801.8 million, of which 60% can be attributed to our Food, Health and Nutrition segment, 32% can be attributed to our Industrial Specialties segment, and 8% can be attributed to our Other segment.
Specialty Ingredients
Specialty Ingredients are the most value adding products in our portfolio. Specialty Ingredients consist of specialty phosphate products, specialty phosphoric acids, including polyphosphoric acid, and a range of other mineral, enzyme and botanical based specialty ingredients. With our 2017 acquisitions of Novel Ingredients and NutraGenesis, we have continued to grow our portfolio of nutritional ingredients, strongly supported by technology. Our Specialty Ingredients products have a wide range of applications, including:

• | flavor enhancers in beverages;


• | electrolytes in sports drinks;


• | texture modifiers in cheeses;


• | leavening agents in baked goods;


• | calcium and phosphorus fortification in food and beverages;


• | moisture and color retention in seafood, poultry and meat;


• | mineral, enzyme and botanical sources for a wide variety of fortified foods, beverages and dietary supplements;


• | excipients in vitamins, minerals, nutritional supplements and pharmaceuticals; and


• | abrasives in toothpaste.

Page  4 of 89

Each product typically has a number of different applications and end uses. For example, our dicalcium phosphate product can be used as an excipient for pharmaceutical and dietary supplements, a leavening agent in bakery products and as an abrasive in oral care products. We often work directly with customers to tailor products to their required specifications for their finished product application.
Core Ingredients
Our Core Ingredients product line includes food grade purified phosphoric acid, or PPA, technical grade PPA, sodium tripolyphosphate, or STPP, and detergent grade PPA. Food grade PPA can be used to produce phosphate salts and has a variety of applications in food and beverages. Technical grade PPA has applications in water treatment. We also sell technical grade PPA in the merchant market to third-party phosphate derivative producers. STPP is a key ingredient in cleaning products, including industrial and institutional cleaners and automatic dishwashing detergents and consumer laundry detergents outside the United States. In addition to its use in cleaning products, STPP is also used in water treatment, clay processing, and copper ore processing. The end use market for STPP is largely derived from consumer product applications. Detergent Grade PPA is a lower grade form of PPA used primarily in the production of STPP.
Co-Products and Other
Our Co-Products and Other product line includes granular triple super phosphate, or GTSP, and merchant green phosphoric acid, or MGA. GTSP is generated at our Coatzacoalcos facility in Mexico as a co-product of our purified wet acid manufacturing process described further below under “Manufacturing”. GTSP is a fertilizer product used throughout Latin America for increasing crop yields in a wide range of agricultural sectors. We sell MGA in the merchant market to third party manufacturers of fertilizer products.
Our Industry
Each of the industries in which we have a presence is competitive in nature.
In connection with our Specialty Ingredients products, we face competition with respect to our phosphate products, as well as our botanical, enzyme and mineral based nutritional ingredients. Many of our phosphate products are viewed as basic ingredients that compete with virtually identical products and derivatives manufactured by other companies in the industry, including companies that utilize the thermal acid method of production described below under “Manufacturing.” North America is a competitive market for phosphates with several competitors importing products from overseas. Our major competitor in the downstream specialty phosphates industry is Israel Chemicals Limited, or ICL. We also compete in the specialty phosphates industry with imports from Germany, Belgium, Israel, Russia, North Africa and China. In recent years, we have faced increasing competition from imports, including domestically located production facilities owned by foreign based organizations. In addition, in recent years, we have experienced pricing pressure from overseas imports, which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. 
Our major PPA competitor is Nutrien Ltd., or Nutrien, formed on January 1, 2018 by the merger of Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc., a global fertilizer company for which specialty phosphates represents only a small part of its business, with Agrium Inc. We consume the majority of our PPA production in our downstream operations and sell the remainder externally, where we compete with Nutrien. We also compete with PPA imports from China, Belgium and Israel.
Our major North American STPP competitor is Mexichem, S.A.B. de C.V., or Mexichem, in Mexico. We also compete with STPP imports from North Africa, Europe, Russia and China. Over the past several decades, there have been regulatory-driven efforts to reduce the use of STPP in consumer and institutional cleaners and it was essentially eliminated in consumer automatic dishwashing applications in the United States and Canada in 2010. The industrial and institutional cleaner market has also reformulated some of its products to reduce STPP content.
We are not a significant supplier to the GTSP or MGA fertilizer markets, and sell our GTSP co-product via a tolling arrangement that was initially established in December 2016.
Our nutritional ingredients business faces competition from a larger number of competitors as the industries in which we compete in connection with this business are highly fragmented. Our competitors in the nutritional ingredients space are multiple, and include Balchem Corporation, Jost Chemical Company, Naturex Inc. and BI Nutraceuticals Inc. to name a few.
For a discussion of the risks associated with the competition that we face in our markets, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business Operations-Competition -The success of our business depends on our ability to successfully compete in competitive markets.” appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Customers
Page  5 of 89

We supply a broad range of customers in over 70 countries worldwide. No customer accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2018, 2017 or 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we generated net sales of $801.8 million, $722.0 million and $725.3 million, respectively.
Our customer base is principally composed of consumer goods manufacturers, specialty chemical manufacturers and distributors. Our customers manufacture products such as soft drinks, sports drinks and juices, various food products and dietary supplements, oral care products, petroleum and petrochemical products, and various cleaners and detergents. Our customers include major consumer goods manufacturers with global market recognition in the food, beverage, pharmaceutical and cleaning product markets. We have maintained long-term relationships with the majority of our key customers, with the average customer relationship having lasted over 15 years, and some relationships spanning many decades. Because our Specialty Ingredient products provide critical functionality and typically represent only a small percentage of our customers’ total end-product cost, our customers generally tend not to frequently change key raw materials or suppliers, especially in highly recognized brands in the food, health and nutrition markets.
Manufacturing
We currently have twelve manufacturing plants located in the United States, Canada, Mexico and China supporting our phosphates and nutrition ingredients products. 
The production of specialty phosphates begins with phosphate rock, which can be processed in two alternative ways to produce PPA: (i) the thermal acid method, in which elemental phosphorus is combusted in a furnace and subsequently hydrated to produce PPA; or (ii) the purified wet acid method utilized by Innophos, in which mined phosphate rock is reacted with an acid (most often sulfuric acid) to produce MGA, which is then purified through solvent-based extraction into PPA. The conversion of MGA into PPA is a technically complex and a capital-intensive process. PPA can be sold or reacted with appropriate mineral salts or inorganic compounds to produce various specialty phosphate products as required. 
We also produce a wide range of botanical, enzyme and mineral based ingredients as part of our nutrition business through a variety of customized production processes resulting in an extensive suite of product formulations. 
Raw Materials and Energy
We purchase a range of raw materials and energy sources on the open market, including phosphate rock, sulfur and sulfuric acid, MGA, PPA, nutritional ingredients, natural gas and electricity. To help secure supply, we purchase several of our key raw materials under multi-year contracts generally providing for fixed or minimum quantities of materials, or purchase of our full requirements, and predetermined pricing formulae based on various market indices and other factors. We do not engage in any significant futures or other derivative contracts to hedge against fluctuations of raw materials. We rely on unaffiliated third parties to provide our raw materials, a result of which is that raw materials acquisition at economical price levels is an important risk of our business. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Raw Materials Availability and Pricing - The success of our business depends on our ability to successfully source sufficient amounts of the raw materials used in our products at competitive prices, often from a limited number of suppliers, some of whom with we do not have a long-term contract in place” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with our sourcing raw materials.
Phosphate Rock and MGA. MGA, which is purified to produce PPA, is the main raw material for the creation of our downstream salts and acids. We currently purchase the MGA for processing at our Geismar, Louisiana facility through a variety of suppliers, including a contract with Nutrien that expires in July 2021. We also source significant quantities internally from our Coatzacoalcos facility in Mexico, where we typically purchase phosphate rock in order to produce MGA. We upgraded our Coatzacoalcos facility to handle alternative grades of rock, which has increased our internal PPA supply and reduced our dependence on any single supplier. In addition to our primary sources, we have options for other spot suppliers and will continue to qualify and develop additional sources for potential future supply.
Sulfur and Sulfuric Acid. Sulfur is the key raw material used in the production of sulfuric acid, a key raw material used in the production of MGA by the wet method. We produce the vast majority of the sulfuric acid required to operate our Coatzacoalcos facility. Our U.S. needs for sulfuric acid and our Mexican needs for sulfur are handled through contracts with third parties.
Purified Phosphoric Acid. The key raw material input for all of our downstream specialty phosphate salt and specialty phosphoric acid operations is PPA. In addition to purifying MGA to produce PPA internally, we also purchase certain quantities of our PPA supply from third parties to optimize our consumption and net sales, including from Nutrien with whom we have a supply contract for PPA (distinct from the supply contract for MGA) which will expire in July 2021, as well as Euro Maroc Phosphate (Emaphos), with whom we have a supply contract through December 2019. We continue to qualify and develop additional sources of PPA. In 2018, we produced approximately 70% and purchased approximately 30% of our total PPA supply.

Nutritional Ingredients. We purchase a variety of botanicals, enzymes and minerals on the international open market for distribution, further processing, packaging and/or branding for our chosen food, beverages and dietary supplement end markets. We typically rely on spot suppliers, and in certain limited cases, short-term contracts, for our botanical, enzyme and mineral needs.
Natural Gas and Electricity. Natural gas and electricity are used to operate our facilities and generate heat and steam for the various manufacturing processes. We typically purchase natural gas and electricity on the North American open market at so-called “spot rates.” From time to time, we may enter into longer term natural gas and electricity supply contracts in an effort to eliminate some of the volatility in our energy costs. We did not enter into any economic hedges in the past three years. 
Research and Development
Our new product and application development activities are aimed at developing and enhancing products, processes and applications by offering differentiated, technology-based solutions to our customers and thereby strengthening our position in the markets we serve. We focus on:

• | developing new or improved application-specific specialty ingredients based on our existing product line and identified or anticipated customer needs;


• | creating new products to be used in new applications or to serve new markets;


• | providing customers with premier technical services as they integrate our ingredients into their products and manufacturing processes;


• | ensuring that our products are manufactured in accordance with our stringent regulatory, health and safety policies and objectives and applicable law;


• | developing more efficient and lower cost manufacturing processes; and


• | expanding existing, and developing new, relationships with customers to meet their product application needs.

Environmental and Regulatory Compliance
Certain of our operations involve manufacturing and marketing ingredients for use in food, nutritional supplement and pharmaceutical excipient products, and therefore must comply with U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, regulatory controls and similar regulatory controls of foreign jurisdictions where we have operations or conduct business, as well as good manufacturing practices and the quality requirements of our customers. The regulation of, and legal requirements for, the manufacture and marketing of our products is a changing environment, and those changes may require increased operating costs to develop and implement additional quality assurance and product safety measures. Although there is some harmonization among the regulatory requirements of various jurisdictions, each country’s specific regulatory requirements apply to products imported and marketed in that country. Regulatory systems throughout the world vary in complexity and transparency, as well as the time required to navigate such system in order to enter the subject market. Our growth that involves expansion of existing products into new markets or new products into current or new markets is affected by our ability to establish a recognized regulatory status for such products, to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and achieve and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, public perception in the United States, Europe and other markets of products we offer for sale in relation to their safety and other market and legal trends related to “natural”, “organic“ and “clean labeling” in foods also may affect our sales and operations.
In addition, our operations that involve the use, handling, processing, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials are subject to extensive and frequently changing environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Federal Railroad Administration, or FRA, as well as regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our operations in Canada, Mexico and China. Our operations also expose us to the risk of claims for environmental remediation and restoration or for exposure to hazardous materials. Our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal or modification. Violations of health and safety and environmental laws, regulations, or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on operating activities, substantial fines, penalties, damages, the rescission of an operating permit, third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, or other costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Due to changes in health and safety and environmental laws and regulations, the time frames when those laws and regulations might be applied, and developments in environmental control technology, we cannot predict with certainty the amount of capital expenditures to be incurred for environmental purposes.
Some environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners, operators or users of facilities, and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. Many of our sites have an extended history of industrial use. Soil and groundwater contamination have been detected at some of our sites, and additional contamination might occur or be discovered at these sites or other sites in the future (including sites to which we may have sent hazardous waste). We continue to investigate, monitor or cleanup contamination at most of these sites. 
Page  7 of 89

The potential liability for all these sites will depend on several factors, including the extent of contamination, the method of remediation, future developments and increasingly stringent regulation, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies, the liability of third parties, potential natural resource damage and insurance coverage. Liabilities for environmental matters are recorded in the accounting period in which our responsibility is established and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Due to the uncertainties associated with environmental investigations, cleanups and other obligations, as well as the ongoing nature of the investigations, cleanups and other obligations at our sites, we are unable to predict precisely the nature, cost and timing of our future remedial obligations with respect to our sites and, as a result, our actual environmental costs and liabilities could significantly exceed our accruals.
Further information, including the current status of significant environmental matters and the financial impact incurred for the remediation of such environmental matters, is included in Note 16 (Commitments and Contingencies) of the Notes to Financial Statements in "Part II, Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Legal, Regulatory and Quality Risks - We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and government policies, including with respect to product quality and labeling and the environment, which may change in significant ways.” and "Evolving Regulatory Standards - Our products may be negatively impacted as a result of evolving regulatory standards." appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect certain key intellectual aspects of our business. In addition, our pool of proprietary information, consisting of manufacturing know-how, trade secrets and unregistered copyrights relating to the design and operation of our facilities and systems, is considered particularly important and valuable. Accordingly, we seek to protect proprietary information through all legal means practicable. However, monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and the steps we have taken may not prevent all unauthorized use by others.
Insurance
In the normal course of business, we are subject to numerous operating risks, including risks associated with environmental contamination, health and safety issues and compliance with food safety laws, while manufacturing, developing, marketing and supplying products.
We currently have in force insurance policies covering property, general liability, excess liability, workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, product liability, product recall, fiduciary and other coverages. We seek to maintain coverages consistent with market practices and required by those customers with whom we do business. Where appropriate for the protection of our property and interests, we also require others with whom we do business to provide certain coverages for our benefit. We believe that we are appropriately insured for the insurable risks associated with our business.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,485 employees at our facilities worldwide, of whom 813 were unionized hourly wage employees. We currently employ both union and non-union employees at most of our facilities. We have experienced no work stoppages or strikes at any of our unionized facilities since acquiring them in 2004. We are a party to a collective bargaining agreement with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, Local No. 7-765 to January 16, 2020 at the Chicago Heights, Illinois facility; International Union of Operating Engineers, Local No. 369 through April 18, 2019 at the Nashville, Tennessee facility; the Health Care, Professional, Technical, Office, Warehouse and Mail Order Employees Union, affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 743 to June 17, 2020 at the Chicago (Waterway), Illinois facility; the United Steelworkers, Local No. 6304 through April 30, 2020 at the Port Maitland, Ontario Canada facility; and the Sindicato de Trabajadores de la Industria Química, Petroquímica, Carboquímica, Gases, Similares y Conexos de la República Mexicana, at the Mexico facilities. The agreement at the Coatzacoalcos, Mexico facility is for an indefinite period, but wages are reviewed every year and the rest of the agreement is subject to negotiation every two years (next scheduled for June 2020).
