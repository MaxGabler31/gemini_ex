ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



Akoustis Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in 2013. The Company is an emerging commercial product company focused on developing, designing, and manufacturing innovative RF filter solutions for the wireless industry, including for products such as smartphones and tablets, network infrastructure equipment, WiFi Customer Premise Equipment (“CPE”), automotive, industrial and defense applications. Filters are critical in selecting and rejecting signals, and their performance enables differentiation in the functionality of the RF front-end (“RFFE”). Located between the device’s antenna and its digital backend, the RFFE is the circuitry that performs the analog signal processing and contains components such as amplifiers, filters and switches. We have developed a proprietary microelectromechanical system (“MEMS”) based bulk acoustic wave (“BAW”) technology and a unique patented transfer process flow, called XBAWTM to manufacture our filters for use in RFFE modules. Our XBAW filters incorporate optimized high purity piezoelectric materials for high power, high frequency and wide bandwidth operation. We are developing RF filters for 5G, WiFi and defense bands using our proprietary resonator device models and product design kits (PDKs). As we qualify our RF filter products, we engage with target customers to evaluate our filter solutions. Our designs target UHB, (sub-6 GHz) 5G, WiFi and defense bands. More recently, we have engaged multiple customers whom lack access to high performance BAW filters and supply RFFE solutions for mobile applications such as smartphones, PC’s and AR/VR devices, to market and sell our products. Our RF filter solutions address problems (such as loss, bandwidth, power handling, and isolation) created by the growing number of frequency bands in the RFFE of mobile devices, PCs, automotive, infrastructure and premise equipment to support 5G, and WiFi. We prototype, sample and shipped commercial production volume of our single-band and multi-band low loss BAW filter designs for 5G frequency bands and 5 GHz and 6 GHz WiFi bands which are suited to competitive BAW solutions and historically cannot be addressed with low-band, lower power handling surface acoustic wave (“SAW”) technology. We manufacture our high-performance RF filter circuits, using our first generation XBAW wafer process, in our 120,000-square foot wafer- manufacturing facility located in Canandaigua, New York, which we acquired in June 2017. Additionally, through our recent acquisition of RFM Integrated Device, Inc. (“RFMi”), we operate a fabless business whereby we make sales of complementary SAW resonators, RF filters, crystal (“Xtal”) resonators and oscillators, and ceramic products—addressing opportunities in multiple end markets, such as automotive and industrial applications. 



We own and/or have filed applications for patents on the core resonator device technology, manufacturing facility and intellectual property (“IP”) necessary to produce our RF filter chips and operate as a “pure-play” RF filter supplier, providing discrete filter solutions direct to Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) and aligning with the front- end module manufacturers that seek to acquire high performance filters to expand their module businesses. We believe this business model is the most direct and efficient means of delivering our solutions to the market.



Technology. Our device technology is based upon bulk-mode acoustic resonance, which we believe is superior to surface-mode resonance for high-band and ultra-high-band (“UHB”) applications that include 4G/LTE, 5G, WiFi, automotive, industrial and defense applications. Although some of our target customers utilize or manufacture the RFFE module, they may lack access to critical UHB filter technology that we produce, which is necessary to compete in high frequency applications.



Manufacturing. We currently manufacture Akoustis’ high-performance RF filter circuits, using our first generation XBAW® wafer process, in our 120,000-square foot wafer- manufacturing facility located in Canandaigua, New York, which we acquired in June 2017. RFMi products are manufactured by a third party and sold by RFMi either directly to customers or sold and shipped with Akoustis products.



Intellectual Property. As of August 31, 2022, our IP portfolio included 67 patents, including a blocking patent that we have licensed from Cornell University. Additionally, as of August 31, 2022, we have 117 pending patent applications. These patents cover our XBAW® RF filter technology from raw materials through the system architectures.



By designing, manufacturing, and marketing our RF filter products to mobile phone OEMs, defense OEMs, network infrastructure OEMs, and WiFi CPE OEMs, we seek to enable broader competition among the front-end module manufacturers.



Since we own and/or have filed applications for patents on the core technology and control access to our intellectual property, we offer several ways to engage with potential customers. First, we engage with multiple wireless markets, providing standardized filters that we design and offer as standard catalog components. Second, we deliver unique filters to customer-supplied specifications, which we design and fabricate on a customized basis. Finally, we offer our models and design kits for our customers to design their own filters utilizing our proprietary technology.

We expect to continue to incur substantial costs for commercialization of our technology on a continuous basis because our business model involves materials and solid-state device technology development and engineering of catalog and custom filter design solutions. To succeed across our combined portfolio of Akoustis, XBAW, and RFMi products, we must convince customers in a wide range of industries including mobile phone OEMs, RFFE module manufacturers, network infrastructure OEMs, WiFi CPE OEMs, medical device makers, automotive and defense customers to use our products in their systems and modules. For example, since there are two dominant BAW filter suppliers in the industry that have high-band technology, and both utilize such technology as a competitive advantage at the module level, we expect customers that lack access to high-band filter technology will be open to engage with our company for XBAW filters.



To help drive our XBAW filter business, we plan to continue to pursue RF filter design and R&D development agreements and potentially joint ventures with target customers and other strategic partners, although we cannot guarantee we will be successful in these efforts. These types of arrangements may subsidize technology development costs and qualification, filter design costs, and offer complementary technology and market intelligence and other avenues to revenue. However, we intend to retain ownership of our core XBAW technology, intellectual property, designs, and related improvements. Across our combined portfolio of Akoustis, XBAW, and RFMi products, we expect to continue development of catalog designs for multiple customers and to offer such catalog products in multiple sales channels.



Impact of COVID-19 on our Business



Although the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is unknown, in an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we have taken proactive, precautionary action, including when warranted by state and local guidelines. Our actions continue to evolve in response to new government measures and scientific knowledge regarding COVID-19. In an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have also enacted various measures, including orders to close all businesses not deemed “essential,” isolate residents to their homes or places of residence, and practice social distancing when engaging in essential activities. These measures have impacted the method and timing of certain business meetings and deliverables to certain customers, as well as our ability to obtain certain materials, equipment and services from suppliers.



These actions and the global health crisis caused by COVID-19 have negatively impacted business activity across the globe. We observed declining demand and price reductions in the electronics industry as business and consumer activity has decelerated. Additionally, COVID-19 has contributed to some of the delays we have observed in certain suppliers’ shipment of materials necessary for us to manufacture our products and in certain vendors’ ability to deliver equipment for installation at our facilities. When COVID-19 is demonstrably contained, we anticipate that its effects on global commerce will subside; however, the timing and extent of this is uncertain.



We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the ultimate effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees, and prospects, or on our financial results for fiscal year 2023 or beyond.

Our XBAW Filter Technology and Business



Current RF acoustic wave filters utilize piezoelectric material physical properties, the resonator device structure and the manufacturing process technology. Existing BAW filters use an “acoustic wave ladder” that is based on a monolithic topology approach using polycrystalline materials.



XBAW technology encompasses cutting-edge polycrystalline, single-crystal and other high purity piezoelectric materials, which are fabricated into bulk-mode, acoustic wave resonators and RF filters. Our innovative piezoelectric materials contain high-purity Group III element nitride materials and possess a unique signature, which can be detected by conventional material metrology tools. We utilize analytical modeling techniques to aid in the design and internal manufacturing of our materials, whereby the raw substrate materials utilized in our XBAW process are sourced from a third party. Once our filter designs are simulated and ready to manufacture, we supply our NY fabrication facility raw materials, a mask design file, and a unique process sequence to fabricate our resonators and filters. We hold many issued and pending patents on our XBAW wafer process flow, which is compatible with wafer level packaging (WLP) that allows for low-profile, cost- effective filters to be produced.



Technological Challenges Facing the Mobile Device Industry



Rising consumer demand for always-on wireless broadband connectivity creates an unprecedented need for high performance RFFE modules for mobile devices. Mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and wearables are quickly becoming the primary means of accessing the Internet, driving the Internet of Things (IoT). Rapid growth in mobile data traffic tests the limits of existing wireless bandwidth. Carriers and regulators have responded by opening new spectrums of RF frequencies, driving up the number of frequency bands in mobile devices. This substantial increase in frequency bands has created a demand for more filters, as well as a demand for filters with higher selectivity. The global transition to LTE and adoption of LTE-Advanced with more sophisticated carrier aggregation and multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) techniques has continued to push the requirements for increased supply of high-performance filters. Furthermore, the introduction of 5G mobile technologies and their associated frequencies over the next several years will create an even greater need for high-performance, high-frequency filters as the bands being auctioned have primarily been in the 3-6 GHz range, well above the frequencies of current networks.



The new spectrum introduced by 4G/LTE and 5G is driving spectrum licensing at higher frequencies than previous 3G smartphone models. For example, new TDD LTE frequencies allocated for 5G wireless cover frequencies nearly twice as high as those covered in previous generation phones. As a result, the demand for filters represents the single largest opportunity in the RFFE industry, according to a Mobile Experts 2022 report. For traditional “low band” frequencies, SAW filters have been the primary choice, while high band solutions have utilized BAW filters due to their performance and yield. While there are multiple sources of supply for SAW technology, the source of supply for BAW filters is more limited and essentially dominated by two manufacturers worldwide. See “Competition” below.



In addition, signal loss of current generation acoustic wave filters is excessively high, and up to half of the transmit power is wasted as heat, which ultimately constrains battery life. Another challenge is that the allocated spectrum for mobile communication bands requires high bandwidth RF filters, which, in turn, requires wide bandwidth core resonator technology. In addition, filters with inferior selectivity either reduce the number or bandwidth of operating bands the mobile device can support or increase the noise in the operating bands. Each of these problems negatively impacts the end-user’s experience when using the mobile device.



The RFFE must meet growing data demands while reducing cost and improving battery life. Our solution involves a new approach to RFFE component manufacturing, enabled by XBAW technology. We expect our XBAW technology to produce filters that will reduce the overall system cost and improve performance of the RFFE.

Our XBAW Filter Solutions 



Our XBAW filter business is focused on the commercialization of wide bandwidth RF filters operating in the high frequency spectrum known as the sub 8 GHz bands. Using our XBAW technology, we believe these filters enable new power amplifier duplexer (PAD) module or RFFE competition for high band modules as well as performance-driven low band applications. Initially, we expect to target select strategic RFFE market leaders as well as tier two mobile phone OEMs and/or RFFE module suppliers. Longer term, the focus of our XBAW filter business will be to expand our market share by engaging with additional mobile phone OEMs and RFFE module manufacturers. We manufacture our XBAW wafers in our Canandaigua, NY fabrication facility where we continue to focus on the commercialization of our filters using our XBAW technology. We plan to continue develop a series of filter designs to be used in the manufacturing of discrete filters, duplexers or more complex multiplexers targeting the 4G/LTE, 5G, WiFi and defense frequency bands. We believe our filter designs will create an alternative for, and replace, filters currently manufactured using materials with fundamentally inferior performance. Figure 1 below illustrates characterization plots that represent the high power, high bandwidth and high frequency capability of our high purity piezoelectric materials.



Figure 1-Characteristics of our high purity piezoelectric materials used to fabricate our BAW RF filters.






Single-Band Discrete Designs, Duplexers and Multiplexers



SAW filters are generally desired in modern RFFE because of their performance, small size and low cost. However, traditional SAW ladder designs do not perform well in high frequency bands or bands with closely spaced receive and transmit channels, typical of many new bands. Therefore, BAW filters are preferred for these bands. In our Canandaigua, NY wafer fabrication facility, we fabricate BAW resonators, the building block of BAW filters, that offer high frequency, wide bandwidth and high-power performance. We believe the improved efficiency provided by BAW filters will reduce the total cost of RFFE modules, offer efficient use of shared frequency spectrum as well as reduce the battery demand of mobile devices. Additionally, we believe that our XBAW technology will allow for a single manufacturing method that will support all of the BAW filter band range and a significant portion of the SAW band range. Figure 2 below illustrates what we believe will be the frequency range of our XBAW technology.

Pure-Play Filter Provider Enables New Module Competition



Given the high sound velocity in our piezoelectric materials, our XBAW technology allows for a wide range of frequency coverage, and we plan to supply XBAW filters that will support 4G/LTE, 5G, WiFi and defense bands. We have successfully demonstrated resonators that will support the design and fabrication of 4G/LTE filters, WiFi filters and defense filters, with frequencies adjacent to the emerging 5G mobile auctions. We have transitioned our XBAW technology to high volume manufacturing and aim to be a pure-play filter supplier that will address the increasing RF complexity placed on RFFE manufacturers supporting 4G/LTE 5G, and WiFi. Figure 3 illustrates historical and projected growth in RF complexity.

Commercialization of XBAW Filters



The immediate focus of our XBAW filter business is on the commercialization of wide bandwidth RF filters to address the WiFi, Network Infrastructure and Defense bands with innovative single-band designs using our XBAW sub 8 GHz RF filter technology. We are currently developing commercial single-band XBAW filters through our wafer fabrication facility in Canandaigua, New York. We are focused on developing fixed-band XBAW filters because we believe these designs present the greatest near-term potential for commercialization of our technology, and that once demonstrated, the facility can be more efficiently readied for production compared to alternative technologies.



Our technology development process consists of the following five phases:




1. | Pre-Alpha – Demonstrate basic feasibility/capabilities
---+-------------------------------------------------------


2. | Alpha – Develop stable recipe (Process freeze) with limited production development
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Beta – Complete technology qualification (Process qualification) in factory to enable product design
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Pre-Production – Demonstrate lead product production capabilities, release final design tools
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Production – Continual improvement of process and parametric performance
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------




We have completed all phases for our first generation XBAW process technology called XB1. Additionally, we have received and delivered orders for pre-production products based on our XBAW process technology, and as of end fiscal 2022, we have shipped more than 32 million filters to the WiFi, 5G infrastructure and defense markets.



Research and Development



Since inception, the Company’s focus has been on developing an innovative wireless filter technology with a compelling value proposition to our potential customers and a significant and noticeable impact to the end user. Compared to legacy polycrystalline material (used to manufacture RF resonators and filters), our patented XBAW technology employs high purity piezoelectric films in our resonators, which are used as the enabler to create high performance BAW RF filters. Our high purity piezoelectric materials are a key differentiator when compared to the incumbent amorphous thin-film technologies because they increase the acoustic velocity, the electromechanical coupling coefficient in the resonator and/or high-power performance. These technology features allow Akoustis to engineer RF filter solutions for a broad spectrum for multiple radio frequencies and thus multiple end markets.



Research and development expense totaled $35.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, and $24.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2021. R&D activities focused on high purity piezoelectric materials development and resonator demonstration. Current R&D investments include materials advancement, resonator development, RF filter design, high yield wafer manufacturing and filter packaging.



As a result of our efforts, we have developed and introduced multiple new BAW filters which are currently sampling and in production with multiple customers across multiple markets. Our focus remains on improving the electromechanical coupling and quality factor of our resonator technology and the performance of our fabricated filters through design improvements and process optimization experiments.



Recent Developments in R&D



We concentrated on several products and end markets in fiscal 2022 including 5G mobile, 5G infrastructure, WiFi and the defense market.



In 5G mobile, we have five active customer engagements. Our first customer is a tier-2 RF module maker that is designing an RF filter using our proprietary and patented XBAW® process that will utilize our new, advanced wafer-level-packaging. This customer is expected to complete the design of this filter in calendar 2022 and enter pre-production in the second half of calendar 2023. Our second customer is a tier-1 RF component company and has engaged Akoustis to develop two filters for 5G connectivity. Akoustis has shipped multiple designs to this customer over the past four months in new, advanced wafer-level-packaging and expects to enter pre-production with the first filter by early calendar 2023. Our third customer is a tier-2 RF component company focused on 4G/5G mobile handsets in Asia. Akoustis is developing a XBAW® filter for this customer to address challenging coexistence bands in 4G and 5G mobile. Our fourth mobile customer is a tier-1 RF module maker that has engaged Akoustis to develop an XBAW® filter to address a challenging coexistence band in 5G mobile. Once design is complete, Akoustis expects to sign a foundry agreement with this customer and expects to enter production with this customer in calendar 2024. Finally, our fifth mobile customer is a leading tier-1 RF module maker that has engaged Akoustis to develop a new 5G filter utilizing our new, state-of-the-art wafer-level-packaging technology. Akoustis delivered early engineering samples to this customer in the second half of fiscal 2022 and expects to continue to work closely with this customer over the next 12-18 months before entering production in calendar 2025.

Advancements in our Wi-Fi portfolio continued in fiscal 2022. With the FCC’s decision to increase the available spectrum for Wi-Fi with the ratification of 5.9-7.1 GHz in April 2020, new filters are needed that can operate at high frequency with ultra-wide bandwidth. This drove investment in the development of both standard and custom XBAW® filters to address this new market over the past twenty-four months. We announced our first two Wi-Fi 6E filters, in fiscal 2021 including a 5.5 GHz and 6.5 GHz XBAW® filter solution with 675 MHz and 1180 MHz of bandwidth. In early fiscal 2022, we entered the Wi-Fi 6E market with our first design win in August of 2021 for a multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) gateway product. By the end of the second quarter, we added multiple new Wi-Fi design wins and added two additional WiFi 6E customers and one additional Wi-Fi 6 customer in production, exiting the quarter with five customers in production, up from one at the end of the prior calendar year.



Figure 4 –WiFi 6E and emerging WiFi 7 channel frequency spectrum






In early January 2022, we announced the addition of five additional design wins in Wi-Fi, four in Wi-Fi 6E and one in Wi-Fi 6, bringing the total number of Wi-Fi design wins to thirteen. We added two additional design wins in April, bringing the total number to fifteen, and we received one additional design win in Wi-Fi 6E in the June 2022 quarter. We are currently sampling and shipping volume pre-production filters with multiple OEMs, ODMs and SoC makers



In June 2020, we entered into a strategic purchase agreement with a tier 1 enterprise-focused WiFi OEM to create customer WiFi 6E XBAW filters for a MU-MIMO enterprise router product. During fiscal 2021 and 2022, we developed multiple filters for this customer, all of which have been design-locked and successfully completed qualification in the June 2022 quarter. We expect to enter production with this customer in the first half of fiscal 2023.



In April, 2021, we announced that we had developed two new WiFi 6E XBAW filters, a 5.6 GHz filter and a 6.6 GHz filter. The 5.6 GHz filter module covers the entire UNII 1-4 spectrum and enables an additional 80 MHz and 160 MHz channel in UNII 4, while the 6.6 GHz filter module covers the UNII 5-8 spectrum. Current WiFi 6E configurations allow for the use of six 80 MHz and three 160 MHz channels in the UNII 1-3 spectrum and fourteen 80 MHz and seven 160 MHz channels in the UNII 5-8 spectrum. The new XBAW 5.6/6.6 GHz coexistence filter modules allow for the use of seven 80 MHz and three 160 MHz channels in the UNII 1-4 spectrum and twelve 80 MHz and six 160 MHz channels in the UNII 5-8 spectrum. Given that the 6 GHz portion of the WiFi 6E standard is just beginning to experience utilization, this new XBAW coexistence solution allows for an environment of greater capacity in the 5 GHz bands. We received our first order from a tier-1 consumer-focused OEM on the same day we introduced the filters, with the first order for the development of new multi-user, multiple-in-multiple-out mesh routing products for the consumer market.



We had several significant advancements in our CBRS and 5G mobile infrastructure business during fiscal 2022. In the June quarter, we entered production with three CBRS infrastructure OEM’s, our first production ramps in mobile infrastructure. Also in the June quarter, we finished the development of our new 3.8 GHz filter for the US market. In late calendar 2020, the FCC auctioned frequencies between 3.7 GHz and 3.98 GHz for 5G mobile use in the United States. Carriers are currently building networks that operate between 3.7 GHz and 3.98 GHz, and we expect to begin sampling our new 3.8 GHz filter to OEMs for use in small cell base stations, which are expected to begin roll out in late calendar 2023 and beyond.

In the defense market, we built on our early successes in phased array radar and drone filters with the award of a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) contract to advance XBAW technology in October of 2020, and the award of a second DARPA contract in April of 2022 to advance the Company’s XBAW technology to 18 GHz. The first program, a Direct-to-Phase-2 (DP2) program, is to facilitate MEMS development, produce novel piezoelectric materials and device designs for both commercial and defense markets. One of the major outcomes from the DP2 program is to develop a piezo MEMS process design kit (PDK) for the Company’s proprietary and patented XBAW process which is expected to support customer engagements that leverage the PDK to create devices and circuits, including RF filters, using the XBAW process. Under the second program, the Company intends to develop a novel mode overtone approach to circumvent trade-offs inherent in traditional BAW frequency scaling approaches.



Akoustis currently has 21 commercial XBAW filters in its product catalog, and recently introduced 5.6 GHz and 6.6 GHz Wi-Fi 6E coexistence filter modules, which when qualified, will bring the number of catalog products to 23. Current product catalog filters include a 5.6 GHz Wi-Fi filter, a 5.2 GHz Wi-Fi filter, a 5.5 GHz Wi-Fi-6E filter, a 6.5 GHz Wi-Fi 6E filter, three small cell 5G network infrastructure filters including two Band n77 filters and one Band n79 filter, a 3.8 GHz filter and five S-Band filters for defense phased-array radar applications, a 3.6 GHz filter for the CBRS 5G infrastructure market and a C-Band filter for the unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) market.

Our RFMi Technology and Business



RFMi is focused on supplying SAW and Xtal based frequency components to automotive, industrial IoT, medical, telecom, consumer, and other markets. The team designs, develops and markets under RFMi-branded SAW band pass filters, notch filters, diplexers, duplexers, resonators and delay lines, as well as Xtal resonators, temperature sensing Xtal resonators, temperature compensated crystal oscillators (“TCXO"), voltage controlled temperature compensated crystal oscillators (“VCTCXO”), crystal oscillators (“XO"), voltage controlled crystal oscillators (“VCXO”), oven controlled crystal oscillators (“OCXO”) and Xtal filters, etc.



Technological Challenges Facing Customers for RFMi-branded Solutions



While wireless spectrum expands to above 3GHz where Akoustis XBAW products are focused, the spectrum under 3GHz is also becoming more and more crowded. Customers are losing “guard bands” next to their operating spectrum to competing applications and operators, and “co-existence” has become necessary for functionality for wireless electronics. LTE applications increasingly need to co-exist with Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (“ISM”) band applications, satellite signals are interfered by terrestrial signals, industrial wireless control signals are saturated by communication signals, even medical wireless signals can be interrupted by other RF power outputs. The more traditional filtering technologies, like L-C (inductor – capacitor) and ceramic filters, may not have a Q factor high enough to supply steep roll-off from passband to rejection band. On the other hand, the demand for available data has also exploded, due to the increasing speed of data transmission and digital communication, which requires faster and more accurate piezo-ceramic resonators.



Our RFMi-branded Solutions for the RFMi Customers



RFMi is addressing jamming and high data rate problems by focusing on frequency components and supplying diverse and flexible SAW and Xtal products. In its operation spectrum (about 30MHz to 3GHz), SAW technology offers one of the highest Q factors. RFMi provides custom and standard SAW band pass filters to allow a signal spectrum to pass while rejecting the other signals, as well as a SAW diplexer with one input and two output, SAW duplexers that transmit and receive simultaneously for Frequency Division Duplex (“FDD”) applications, and SAW resonators for high frequency transmitters, as well as custom delay lines. For Xtal products, instead of only supplying standard Xtal resonators at a few frequencies, RFMi provides a family of Xtal products and supports custom designs to accommodate a wider temperature range than standard products, stable frequency, and low jitter and phase noise.



Raw Materials



Within its internal manufacturing operation for XBAW filters, Akoustis sources raw materials, process gases, metals and other miscellaneous supplies to fabricate its BAW RF filter circuits. Materials range from substrates (used to deposit key piezoelectric materials) to standard dielectric-based laminates (used for packaging of the RF filter circuits). The Company sources at least two types of substrate materials for its BAW process and we have more than one supplier for one material and a single source for the other. Multiple process gases are used for material synthesis, process etching and wafer treatment. While there is more than one supplier for most process gases, the purity levels of such gases may change by source. Hence, either purification or process requalification may be required when purchasing from a second source is required. Akoustis sources various high purity metals for electrode formation and interconnect layers for its RF circuits. Such metals are available in various purity levels and are available from more than one supplier. Other process handling hardware common to the semiconductor industry is available in abundance from multiple suppliers. Consistent with other semiconductor manufacturers, the Company may have to work with all its suppliers to ensure adequate supply of raw materials, process gases and metals as the Company ramps from R&D into high volume manufacturing.

RFMi Supply Chain



RFMi mainly relies on its contract manufacturer, Tai-Saw Technology Co., Ltd. (“TST”) to source raw materials, such as different chemicals and gases for front and back-end manufacturing, quartz, lithium tantalate and certain bonded wafers, metal targets, Xtal blanks, semiconductor IC’s, aluminum bonding wires and flip chip gold stub bump supplies, packages and lids. Most raw materials have dual or multi-sources. However, certain materials, e.g., high temperature co-fired ceramic (“HTCC”) ceramic packages, bonded wafers and automotive grade TCXO/VCTCXO IC’s are single-sourced as there is no alternative supplier or the alternative supplier does not guarantee automotive grade materials. Many of RFMi’s customers are automotive and require a Production Part Approval Process (“PPAP”), where using an alternative source may require re-PPAP and take efforts and time. RFMi intends to diversity its supply chain, however, it takes time and resources. Certain raw material, like HTCC ceramic packages, may not have a second source for the foreseeable future.
Intellectual Property



We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents and trade secrets, along with copyrights, trademarks and contractual obligations and restrictions to protect our core technology and business.



In the United States and internationally, as of August 31, 2022, our IP portfolio included 67 patents, including one blocking patent that we have licensed from Cornell University. Additionally, we have 117 active and pending patent applications. These patents cover our XBAW RF filter technology from the substrate level through the system application layer. Where possible, we leverage both federal and state level R&D grants to support development and commercialization of our technology. Our owned patents expire between 2034 and 2040. We intend to continue to innovate and expand our patent portfolio, and when appropriate, we will look to purchase license(s) that grant access to additional intellectual property that enables, enhances or further expands our technical capabilities and/or product.



We believe that Akoustis has competitive advantages from rights granted under our patent applications. Some applications, however, may not result in the issuance of any patents. In addition, any future patent may be opposed, contested, circumvented or designed around by a third party or found to be unenforceable or invalidated. Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies, duplicate our proprietary technologies or design around patents owned or licensed by us.



We generally control access to, and use of, our confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors and customers. We rely in part on the United States and international copyright laws to protect our intellectual property. All employees and consultants are required to execute confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements in connection with their employment and consulting relationships with us. We also require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived or made in connection with the employment or consulting relationship.



Competition



The RF filter market is controlled by a relatively small number of RF component suppliers. These companies include, among others, Broadcom Corporation, Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd.(“Murata”), Qorvo, Inc., Skyworks Solutions Inc., Taiyo Yuden Co. Ltd., and Qualcomm Incorporated. Broadcom Corporation and Qorvo, Inc. dominate the high band BAW filter market, controlling a significant portion of the customer base and are increasing capacity to meet the growing RF filter demand of the 4G/5G cellular market.



We compete directly with these companies to secure design slots inside RFFE module targeting companies that procure filters or internally source filters. While many of our competitors have more resources than we have, we believe that our filter designs will be superior in performance, and we approach prospective customers as a pure-play filter supplier, offering advantages in performance over the full frequency range at competitive costs. Our challenges include convincing our customers that we have a strong intellectual property position, that we will be able to deliver in volume, that we will meet their price targets, and that we can satisfy quality, reliability and other requirements. For a list of other competitive factors, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are still developing many of our products, and they may not be accepted in the market.”

The Xtal market is more mature and there are many players, including Epson, KDS Daishinku, Kyocera, Murata and NDK from Japan and TXC from Taiwan. Our RFMi products are largely focused on niche markets such as Industrial IoT and professional audio, which may reduce competition with these large, high volume competitors. In addition, our RFMi products primarily consist of TCXO, VCTCXO and VCXO, instead of low cost Xtal. However, we may still compete with market participants with more resources and purchasing power than us.



Employees



We place an emphasis on hiring the best talent at the right time to enable our core technology and business growth. This includes establishing a competitive compensation and benefits package, thereby enhancing our ability to recruit experienced personnel and key technologists. As of June 30, 2022, we had a total of 205 full-time employees plus 4 part-time and temporary employees. We will continue to hire specific and targeted positions to further enable our technology and manufacturing capabilities as and when appropriate.
Government Regulations



Our business and products in development are subject to regulation by various federal and state governmental agencies, including the radio frequency emission regulatory activities of the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”), the consumer protection laws of the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the import/export regulatory activities of the Department of Commerce, the product safety regulatory activities of the Consumer Products Safety Commission, and the environmental regulatory activities of the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”).



The rules and regulations of the FCC limit the RF used by, and level of power emitting from, electronic equipment. Our RF filters, as a key element enabling consumer electronic smartphone equipment, are required to comply with these FCC rules and may require certification, verification or registration of our RF filters with the FCC. Certification and verification of new equipment requires testing to ensure the equipment’s compliance with the FCC’s rules. The equipment must be labeled according to the FCC’s rules to show compliance with these rules. Testing, processing of the FCC’s equipment certificate or FCC registration and labeling may increase development and production costs and could delay the implementation of our XBAW acoustic wave resonator technology for our RF filters and the launch and commercial productions of our filters into the U.S. market. Electronic equipment permitted or authorized to be used by us through FCC certification or verification procedures must not cause harmful interference to licensed FCC users, and may be subject to RF interference from licensed FCC users. Selling, leasing or importing non-compliant equipment is considered a violation of FCC rules and federal law, and violators may be subject to an enforcement action by the FCC. Any failure to comply with the applicable rules and regulations of the FCC could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition by increasing our compliance costs and/or limiting our sales in the United States.



Like our XBAW products, RFMi’s SAW and Xtal products are frequency components and are subject to similar FCC rules. For instance, many of RFMi’s customers operate in ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band, MICS (Medical Implant Communication System), WMTS (Wireless Medical Telemetry Service) and other bands regulated by FCC, in which transmission power level is restricted and products have to pass the FCC, and in certain cases FDA certification to be allowed in the market. Even though RFMi’s components do not need to be certified by FCC and/or FDA, our customers modules and systems which incorporate RFMi components may need to be certified. Any failure of RFMi’s customers to be certified would affect RFMi’s sales.



The semiconductor and electronics industries also have been subject to increasing environmental regulations. A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been used in our products in development or processes. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results. We will continue to monitor our quality program and expand as required to maintain compliance and ability to audit our supply chain.



Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, or injunctions. An adverse outcome in any such litigation could require us to pay contractual damages, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. These enforcement actions could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees.
