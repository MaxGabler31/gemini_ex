Business Segments
Our business is composed of one segment, petroleum additives, which is primarily represented by Afton. The antiknock compounds business of Ethyl is reflected in the “All other” category. Each of these is discussed below.
Petroleum Additives—Petroleum additives are used in lubricating oils and fuels to enhance their performance in machinery, vehicles, and other equipment. We manufacture chemical components that are selected to perform one or more specific functions and combine those chemicals with other chemicals or components to form additive packages for use in specified end-user applications. The petroleum additives market is a global marketplace, with customers ranging from large, integrated oil companies to national, regional, and independent companies. 
We believe our success in the petroleum additives market is largely due to our ability to deliver value to our customers through our products and our open, flexible, and collaborative working style. We accomplish this by understanding what our customers value and by applying our technical capabilities, formulation expertise, broadly differentiated product solutions, and global supply capabilities to satisfy the customers' needs. We invest significantly in research and development in order to meet our customers’ needs and to adapt to the rapidly changing environment for new and improved products and services.
We view the petroleum additives marketplace as being comprised of two broad product applications: lubricant additives and fuel additives. Lubricant additives are highly formulated chemical solutions that, when blended with base fluids, improve the efficiency, durability, performance, and functionality of mineral oils, synthetic oils, and biodegradable fluids, thereby enhancing the performance of machinery and engines. Fuel additives are chemical components that help oil refiners meet fuel specifications or formulated packages that improve the performance of gasoline, diesel, biofuels, and other fuels, resulting in lower operating costs, improved vehicle performance, and reduced emissions.
Lubricant Additives
Lubricant additives are essential ingredients for making lubricating oils. Lubricant additives are used in a wide variety of vehicle and industrial applications, including engine oils, transmission fluids, off-road powertrain and hydraulic systems, gear oils, hydraulic oils, and turbine oils, and virtually any other application where metal-to-metal moving parts are utilized. Lubricant additives are organic and synthetic chemical components that enhance wear protection, prevent deposits, and protect against the hostile operating environment of an engine, transmission, axle, hydraulic pump, or industrial machine.
Lubricants are widely used in operating machinery from transportation vehicles to heavy industrial equipment. Lubricants provide a layer of protection between moving mechanical parts. Without this layer of protection, the normal functioning of machinery would not occur. Effective lubricants reduce downtime and increase efficiency. Specifically, lubricants serve the following main functions:
•friction reduction—Friction is reduced by maintaining a thin film of lubricant between moving surfaces, preventing them from coming into direct contact with one another and reducing wear on moving machinery, thereby providing longer life and operational efficiency.
•heat removal—Lubricants act as coolants by removing heat resulting either from friction or through contact with other, higher temperature materials.
•containment of contaminants—Lubricants function by carrying contaminants away from the machinery and neutralizing the harmful impact of the by-products created by combustion.
The functionality of lubricants is created through an exact balance between a base fluid and performance enhancing additives. This balance is the goal of effective formulations achieved by experienced research and development professionals. We offer a full line of lubricant additive packages, each of which is composed of component chemicals specially selected to perform desired functions. We manufacture most of the chemical components and blend these components to create formulated additive packages designed to meet industry and customer specifications. Lubricant additive components are generally classified based upon their intended functionality, including:
•detergents, which clean moving parts of engines and machines, suspend oil contaminants and combustion by-products, and absorb acidic combustion products;
•dispersants, which serve to inhibit the formation of sludge and particulates;
•extreme pressure/antiwear agents, which reduce wear on moving engine and machinery parts;
•viscosity index modifiers, which improve the viscosity and temperature characteristics of lubricants and help the lubricant flow evenly to all parts of an engine or machine; and
•antioxidants, which prevent oil from degrading over time.
We are one of the leading global suppliers of specially formulated lubricant additives that combine some or all of the components described above to develop our products. Our products are highly formulated, complex chemical compositions derived from extensive research and testing to ensure all additive components work together to provide the intended results. Our products are engineered to meet specifications prescribed by either the industry or a specific customer. Purchasers of lubricant additives tend to be integrated oil companies or independent compounders/blenders. We make no sales directly to end-users or to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).
We view our participation in the lubricant marketplace in three primary areas: engine oil additives, driveline additives, and industrial additives. Our view is not necessarily the same way others view the market.
Engine Oil Additives—The largest submarket within the lubricant additives marketplace is engine oil additives which consists of additives designed for passenger cars, motorcycles, on and off-road heavy duty commercial equipment, locomotives, and large engines in ocean-going vessels. We estimate engine oil additives represent approximately 70% of the overall lubricant additives market volume. 
The engine oil market’s primary customers include consumers, fleet owners, mining and construction companies, farmers, railroads, shipping companies, service dealers, and OEMs. The primary functions of engine oil additives are to reduce friction, prevent wear, control formation of sludge and oxidation, and prevent rust. Engine oil additives are typically sold to lubricant manufacturers who combine them with a base oil fluid to meet internal, industry, and OEM specifications.
Key drivers of engine oil additives demand are the number of vehicles on the road, total vehicle miles driven, fuel economy, the average age of vehicles on the road, drain intervals, engine and crankcase size, changes in engine design, and temperature and specification changes driven by the OEMs. The extension of drain intervals has generally offset increased demand due to higher vehicle population, new hardware, and more miles driven. Other key drivers include industrial production rates, agricultural output, mining and construction output, environmental regulations, and infrastructure investments of commercial companies. Afton offers products that enhance the performance of mineral, part-synthetic, and fully-synthetic engine oils.
Driveline Additives— The driveline additives submarket is comprised of additives designed for products such as transmission fluids, axle fluids, and off-road powertrain fluids. This submarket shares in the 30% of the market not covered by engine oil additives. Transmission fluids primarily serve as the power transmission and heat transfer medium in the area of the transmission where the torque of the drive shaft is transferred to the gears of the vehicle. Axle fluids lubricate gears and bearings in axles, and powertrain fluids are used in off-highway powertrain and hydraulic systems. Other products in this area include power steering fluids, shock absorber fluids, gear oils, and lubricants for heavy machinery. Additionally, as a leading additive supplier to the electric vehicle market, we are investing in and delivering new technologies to enable electric vehicle market growth to help reduce carbon emissions. We anticipated and are responding to the need for future lubricants to consider conductivity, the effect of electric fields, low friction/high speed, noise, and battery cooling or copper wire drawing. All of these products must conform to highly prescribed specifications developed by vehicle OEMs for specific models or designs. These additives are generally sold to oil companies for ultimate sale to vehicle OEMs for new vehicles (factory-fill), service dealers for aftermarket servicing (service-fill), retailers, and distributors. 
Key drivers of the driveline additives marketplace are the number of vehicles manufactured, total number of vehicles in operation, drain intervals for transmission fluids and axle fluids, changes in engine and transmission design and temperatures, and specification changes driven by the OEMs.
Industrial Additives—The industrial additives submarket is comprised of additives designed for products for industrial applications such as hydraulic fluids, grease, industrial gear fluids, and industrial specialty applications, such as turbine oils. This submarket also shares in the 30% of the market not covered by engine oil additives. These products must conform to industry specifications, OEM requirements, and/or application and operating environment demands. Industrial additives are generally sold to oil companies, service dealers for after-market servicing, and distributors.
Key drivers of the industrial additives marketplace are gross domestic product levels and industrial production.
Fuel Additives
Fuel additives are chemical compounds that are used to improve both the oil refining process and the performance of gasoline, diesel, biofuels, and other fuels. Benefits of fuel additives in the oil refining process include reduced use of crude oil, lower processing costs, and improved fuel storage properties. Fuel performance additives enhance fuel economy, improve ignition and combustion efficiency, reduce emission particulates, maintain engine cleanliness, and protect against deposits in fuel injectors, intake valves, and the combustion chamber. Our fuel additives are extensively tested and designed to meet stringent industry, government, OEM, and individual customer requirements.
Many different types of additives are used in fuels. Their use is generally determined by customer, industry, OEM, and government specifications, and often differs from country to country. The types of fuel additives we offer include:
•gasoline performance additives, which clean and maintain key elements of the fuel delivery systems, including fuel injectors and intake valves, in gasoline engines;
•diesel fuel performance additives, which perform similar cleaning functions in diesel engines;
•cetane improvers, which increase the cetane number (ignition quality) in diesel fuel by reducing the delay between injection and ignition;
•stabilizers, which reduce or eliminate oxidation in fuel;
•corrosion inhibitors, which minimize the corrosive effects of combustion by-products and prevent rust;
•lubricity additives, which restore lubricating properties lost in the refining process;
•cold flow improvers, which improve the pumping and flow of distillate and diesel fuels in cold temperatures;
•octane enhancers, which increase octane ratings and decrease emissions; and
•static dissipating additives.
We offer a broad line of fuel additives worldwide and sell our products to major fuel marketers and refiners, as well as independent terminals and other fuel blenders.
Key drivers in the fuel additive marketplace include total vehicle miles driven, fuel economy, the introduction of new engine designs, regulations on emissions (both gasoline and diesel), quality of the crude oil slate and performance standards, and marketing programs of major oil companies.
Competition
We believe we are one of the four largest manufacturers and suppliers in the petroleum additives marketplace.
In the lubricant additives submarket, our major competitors are The Lubrizol Corporation (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.), Infineum (a joint venture between ExxonMobil Chemical and Shell plc), and Chevron Oronite Company LLC. There are several other suppliers in the worldwide market who are competitors in their particular product areas.
The fuel additives submarket is characterized by more competitors. While we participate in many facets of the fuel additives market, our competitors tend to be more narrowly focused. In the gasoline detergent market, we compete mainly against BASF, Chevron Oronite Company LLC, and The Lubrizol Corporation. In the diesel and refinery markets, we compete mainly against The Lubrizol Corporation, Infineum, BASF, Clariant Ltd., Dorf Ketal, and Innospec Inc. We also compete against other regional companies in the fuel additives marketplace.
The competition among the participants in these industries is characterized by the need to provide customers with cost effective, technologically-capable products that meet or exceed industry specifications. The need to continually increase technology performance and lower cost through formulation technology and cost improvement programs is vital for success in this environment.
All Other—The “All other” category includes the operations of the antiknock compounds business (primarily sales of antiknock compounds in North America), as well as certain contracted manufacturing and services performed by Ethyl. The Ethyl facility is located in Houston, Texas and is substantially dedicated to terminal operations related to antiknock compounds and other fuel additives. The financial results of the petroleum additives activities by Ethyl are reflected in the petroleum additives segment results. The “All other” category financial results include a service fee charged by Ethyl for its production services to Afton. 
Human Capital
Our Values are the foundation of our company and support the inclusive and respectful culture we have established in all of our locations around the world. Our Values include:
•unquestioned integrity,
•respect for people,
•safety and environmental responsibility,
•partners with customers and suppliers,
•continuously improving quality,
•citizenship, and
•economic viability.
We place the highest level of commitment on safety and strive to operate our business every day focused on its importance. Keeping our employees safe is a management priority, and the past two years were particularly challenging in that regard because of the COVID-19 pandemic. While many of our employees were required to work from home due to government mandates, all of our facilities continued to be operational throughout 2020 and 2021 since the chemical industry and our products are considered essential for the transportation of goods and services. For employees working onsite at our facilities, management invested significant time and effort to ensure the safety of our employees, above and beyond local government requirements and guidance, and to help mitigate risk. 
We have a diverse workforce, representative of the geographic regions in which we do business. We place a high value on diverse thoughts, skills, perspectives, cultures, and knowledge because we believe that such diversity results in better business decision making. We employed 2,104 people at the end of 2021. Approximately 1,100 were located in the United States, 500 were in the Europe/Middle East/Africa/India region, 300 were in the Asia Pacific region, and 200 were in the Latin America region. Approximately 22% of our workforce is represented by unions. 
When we hire new employees, our goal is that they stay with our company for the remainder of their career. Hiring the right people for the long-term and developing them for key roles is something we focus on. In order to be successful, we must attract and retain a highly qualified and technically competent workforce, including key employees in leadership positions. As technology changes in the petroleum additives industry are ongoing, the success of our business is very dependent upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific and technical personnel. In addition to utilizing our internal network, contacts, and specialized recruiters to identify and attract qualified personnel, we have established relationships with a number of universities globally and have intern and co-op programs in many of our locations. 
Globally, approximately 17% of our employees have 20 years or more of service, and over the three year period from 2019 to 2021, our resignation rate was approximately 3.7%. We believe these measures demonstrate our success in hiring the right employees for the long-term and establishing a culture where respect for people is an everyday value. 
Raw Materials and Product Supply
We use a variety of raw materials and chemicals in our manufacturing and blending processes and believe the sources of these are adequate for our current operations. The primary raw materials for Afton are base oil, polyisobutylene, antioxidants, alcohols, solvents, detergents, friction modifiers, olefins, and copolymers.
As the performance requirements of our products become more complex, we often work with highly specialized suppliers. In some cases, we source from a single supplier. In cases where we decide to source from a single supplier, we manage our risk by maintaining safety stock of the raw material or qualifying alternate suppliers. The backup position could take additional time to implement, but we are confident we can ensure continued supply for our customers. 
During 2021, global supply chain disruptions negatively affected both supply, as well as distribution and transportation networks. While many of these challenges continue into 2022, we continuously monitor our raw material supply situation and adjust our procurement strategies as conditions require.

Governmental and Environmental Regulations
As a chemical company, we are subject to regulation by local, state, federal, and foreign governmental authorities specific to the production, distribution, management, and stewardship of chemicals. 
In addition, in the United States and under similar foreign and state laws, we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations, as well as environmental liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances. These liabilities may include personal injury, property damage, or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. They may be imposed on us in a range of situations without regard to violation of law or regulations. They may also be imposed jointly and severally, where one party may be held liable for a disproportionate share of the damages, up to and including the entire loss. These liabilities may include entities with any possible connection to the hazardous substances, including, for example, entities that formerly owned or operated a property or entities that arranged for disposal of hazardous substances from a property. 
We believe we comply, in all material respects, with laws, regulations, statutes, and ordinances, including, but not limited to, those protecting the environment, as well as those related to the management and stewardship of chemicals. We have policies and procedures in place that establish regular reviews of our regulatory and environmental compliance and product stewardship, and actively monitor any significant existing or potential regulatory changes or environmental issues that could materially affect the company.
Our total accruals for environmental remediation, dismantling, and decontamination were approximately $11 million at December 31, 2021 and $10 million at December 31, 2020. As new technology becomes available, it may be possible to reduce accrued amounts. While we believe that we are currently fully accrued for known environmental issues, it is possible that unexpected future costs could have a significant financial impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
The costs of complying with existing environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations as they pertain to our products and operations, including remediation, closure, and postclosure costs, are primarily included in cost of goods sold. We spent approximately $35 million in 2021 and $29 million in both 2020 and 2019 for ongoing environmental operating and clean-up costs, excluding depreciation of previously capitalized expenditures. 
In addition to the ongoing environmental compliance costs and the costs to remediate contaminated sites, worldwide capital expenditures for pollution prevention and safety projects were $17 million in both 2021 and 2020 and $8 million in 2019. 
The costs of complying with governmental pollution prevention and safety regulations are subject to:
•potential changes in applicable statutes and regulations (or their enforcement and interpretation);
•uncertainty as to the success of anticipated solutions to pollution problems;
•uncertainty as to whether additional expense may prove necessary; and
•potential for emerging technology to affect remediation methods and reduce associated costs.
