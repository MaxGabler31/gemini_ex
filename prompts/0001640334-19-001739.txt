ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Information

GSG Group Inc. (“the Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 11, 2014. Initially we were a development-stage company in a business of printing on ornamental ribbons. Our initial office was located at Via Lodovico Berti, 40131, Bologna, Italy.

On April 6, 2017, Corina Safaler, the Company’s former Director and CEO, completed a transaction with Wentao Zhao, by which Mr. Zhao acquired 4,500,000 shares of common stock, representing 74% ownership of the Company. On the same date, the shareholders of the Company voted Sreyneang Jin as Director and CEO, and Gim Hooi Ooi as CFO. The new management decided to cease the existing business of printing ornamental ribbons and explore new business plan that will generate sufficient cash flows and profits to the Company. The Company has leased its office at 18/F Canadia Bank Tower, No. 315, Ang Doung St, Corner Monivong Blve, Phnom Penh, Cambodia for future business.

On August 17, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company approved that the Company changed its name to GSG Group Inc. and the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State. The name change was approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) on September 15, 2017.

On November 22, 2017 Mr. Zhao and Mr. Xin Chen had entered into an agreements whereas Mr. Chen would purchase from Mr. Zhao 3,900,000 shares of the common stock of Company against a cash payment of $260,000, the shares representing 65% of all Company´s common stock and a further 600,000 shares purchased by two non-notifiable buyers. At the time all transfers were affected on the share register on February 28, 2018, the forward split had been implemented, giving Mr. Chen a position of 19,500,000 shares, or 65%. Mr Chen then disposed of further 200,000 shares, leaving him with 19,300,000 shares representing 64% of control over the Company as per. 

On May 15, 2018 Mr. Chen and Comindus Finance Corp entered into an agreement whereas Comindus Finance was to purchase 19,300,000 shares of Company´s common stock from Mr. Chen. While the shares were transferred to Comindus Finance Corp. as per July 31, 2018, the transaction was cancelled and unwound shortly thereafter, so that Mr. Chen remained throughout the entire time, the rightful owner of 19,300,000 shares. Mr. Chen later disposed of 300,000 of his shares in a private transaction and, at the date of this document, remains the owner of 19,000,000 shares in the Company, representing 63%. The transfer agent has been instructed to re-enter Mr. Chen on the share register accordingly, the process of which has not yet been completed at the date of this document due to formal reasons.

On May 21, 2018, Ms. Jin Sreyneang rendered her resignation as director of the company in anticipation of the new controlling shareholder wishing to appoint director(s) as per his choosing. However, following the unwinding of the control block transfer, no new directors have been appointed. The resignation of Ms. Sreyneang was confirmed by shareholder vote on December 04, 2018.
