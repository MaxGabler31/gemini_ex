Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Our History 
 Our history dates to 1992 with the joint venture between Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (“Hilton”) and with Grand Vacations, Limited. In 1996, Hilton Grand Vacations became a wholly owned subsidiary of Hilton. During the ensuing years, we expanded our operations and established a track record of innovation in our industry. Unlike the broader timeshare industry, which experienced a contraction in 2008 and 2009 as a result of the overall economic recession, we were able to grow contract sales during the industry downturn and have continued to deliver contract sales growth in each period since, driven by our continued focus on marketing and sales activities, our strong development margins, large-market distribution model, synergies with Hilton, commitment to new owner transactions and lean organizational structure. 
Our Business 
 We are a rapidly growing timeshare company that markets and sells vacation ownership intervals (“VOIs”), manages resorts in top leisure and urban destinations, and operates a points-based vacation club. As of December 31, 2017, we have 48 resorts, representing 8,102 units, are located in iconic vacation destinations such as the Hawaiian Islands, New York City, Orlando and Las Vegas, and feature spacious, condominium-style accommodations with superior amenities and quality service. As of December 31, 2017, we have approximately 288,000 Hilton Grand Vacations Club (the “Club”) members. Club members have the flexibility to exchange their VOIs for stays at any Hilton Grand Vacations resort or any property in the Hilton system of 14 industry-leading brands across more than 5,000 properties, as well as numerous experiential vacation options, such as cruises and guided tours. 
 Our compelling VOI product allows customers to advance purchase a lifetime of vacations. Because our VOI owners generally purchase only the vacation time they intend to use each year, they are able to efficiently split the full cost of owning and maintaining a vacation residence with other owners. Our customers also benefit from the high-quality amenities and service at our Hilton-branded resorts. Furthermore, our points-based platform offers members tremendous flexibility, enabling us to more effectively adapt to their changing vacation needs over time. Building on the strength of that platform, we continuously seek new ways to add value to our Club membership, including enhanced product offerings, greater geographic distribution, broader exchange networks and further technological innovation, all of which drive better, more personalized vacation experiences and guest satisfaction. 
 As innovators in the timeshare business, we have successfully transformed from a highly capital-intensive business to a capital-efficient model by pursuing an inventory strategy focused on fee-for-service and just-in-time inventory acquisition. 
 Recent Events
 On October 13, 2017, we acquired the remaining unsold inventory at an 83-unit, ski-in mountain lodge in Park City, Utah, known as “The Sunrise Lodge, a Hilton Grand Vacations Club.” Prior to the acquisition, we were providing marketing, sales and resort management services to the seller, Sunrise Park City, LLC, under a fee-for-service agreement. 
 On November 13, 2017, we entered into an agreement with Mori Trust to construct a new mixed-used development on Sesokojima Island, Okinawa in Japan, which will be our first timeshare project in Japan. The new-build development, to be constructed by Mori Trust, will comprise a 132-unit timeshare resort that will be owned and managed by us, as well as a 300-room hotel that will be owned by Mori Trust and managed by Hilton. The hotel component is set to open in 2020, and the timeshare resort is expected to commence operations in 2021. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and project milestones, we expect to make an aggregate investment of up to approximately $187 million in phases over four years commencing in 2021.

Our Reportable Segments 
 We operate our business across two segments: (1) real estate sales and financing; and (2) resort operations and club management. For more information regarding our segments, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 19: Business Segments in our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Our real estate sales and financing segment generates revenue from: 
  
• | VOI Sales—We sell our owned inventory and, through our fee-for-service agreements, we sell VOIs on behalf of third-party developers using the Hilton Grand Vacations brand in exchange for sales, marketing and brand fees. Under these agreements, we earn commission fees based on a percentage of total interval sales. See “—Inventory and Development Activities” and “—Marketing and Sales Activities” below for further information.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Financing—We provide consumer financing, which includes interest income generated from the origination of consumer loans to members to finance their purchase of VOIs owned by us. We also generate fee revenue from servicing the loans provided by third-party developers to purchasers of their VOIs. See “—Financing Activities” below for information regarding our consumer financing activities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our resort operations and club management segment generates revenue from: 
  
• | Resort Management—Our resort management services primarily consist of operating properties under management agreements for the benefit of homeowners’ association (“HOA”s) of VOI owners at both our resorts and those owned by third parties. Our management agreements with HOAs provide for a cost-plus management fee, which means we generally earn a fee equal to 10 percent to 15 percent of the costs to operate the applicable resort. We also earn revenue from retail and spa outlets at our timeshare properties. See “—Resort and Club Management Activities” below for information regarding our resort management activities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Club Management—We manage the Hilton Grand Vacations Club and the Hilton Club which operates for VOI owners at the Hilton New York and The District, our new resort in Washington D.C. (“The District”), receiving activation fees, annual dues and transaction fees from member exchanges for other vacation products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rental of Available Inventory—We generate rental revenue from unit rentals of unsold inventory and inventory made available due to ownership exchanges through our Club programs. This allows us to utilize otherwise unoccupied inventory to generate additional revenues. We also earn fee revenue from the rental of inventory owned by third parties. See “—Resort and Club Management Activities” below for further information.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other than the United States, there were no countries that individually represented more than 10 percent of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 Our Products 
 Our primary products are fee-simple VOIs deeded in perpetuity, developed or acquired by us or by third parties. This ownership interest is an interest in real estate equivalent to annual usage rights, generally for one week, at the timeshare property where the VOI is purchased. Each Club property provides a distinctive setting, while signature elements remain consistent, such as high-quality guest service, spacious units and extensive on-property amenities. Most resorts feature studio to three-bedroom condominium-style accommodations and amenities such as full kitchens, in-unit washers and dryers, spas and kids’ clubs. Our timeshare properties are relatively concentrated in significant tourist markets, including Florida, Hawaii, Nevada, New York, Washington D.C. and South Carolina. 
 In addition, VOI purchasers are enrolled in our flexible, points-based Hilton Grand Vacations Club exchange program. This gives a member an annual allotment of Club points based on the value of the owned interest. Club points can be used for a priority reservation period at the home resort where a member’s VOI is deeded, and exchanged for a variety of vacation options, including stays at any Hilton Grand Vacations resort, conversion to 
 3


Hilton Honors® points for stays at the more than 5,000 Hilton-branded hotels and resorts, reservations for experiential travel such as cruises and guided tours, and stays at more than 4,300 resorts included in the RCI vacation exchange network. Our members also have the flexibility to choose when they will take advantage of their annual usage rights and have the option to split their time over the year. All members pay activation fees, annual dues and certain transaction fees depending on their exchange of Club points. 
 Inventory and Development Activities 
 We secure VOI inventory by developing or acquiring resorts in strategic markets, building additional phases at our existing resorts, re-acquiring inventory in the open market and sourcing inventory from third-party developers through fee-for-service and just-in-time transactions. 
 Our development activities involving the acquisition of real estate are followed by construction or renovation to create individual vacation ownership units. The development and construction of the units require a large upfront investment of capital and can take several years to complete in the case of a ground-up project. This investment cannot be recovered until the individual VOIs are sold to purchasers which can take several years. Traditionally, timeshare operators have funded 100 percent of the investment necessary to acquire land and construct timeshare properties. 
 We source VOIs through fee-for-service agreements with third-party developers. These agreements enable us to generate fees from the marketing and sale of Hilton-branded VOIs and Club memberships and from the management of the timeshare properties without requiring us to fund up-front acquisition and construction costs or incur unsold inventory maintenance costs. The capital investment we make in connection with these projects is typically limited to the cost of constructing our on-site sales centers. In just-in-time transactions, we acquire and sell inventory in transactions that are designed to closely correlate the timing of our acquisition of inventory with our sale of that inventory to purchasers. We refer to fee-for-service transactions and just-in-time sales as “capital-efficient transactions.” Over time, these capital-efficient transactions have evolved from sourcing inventory from distressed properties to sourcing from new construction projects. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales from fee-for-service, just-in-time and developed inventory sources were 54 percent, 20 percent and 26 percent, respectively, of contract sales. Based on our 2017 sales pace, we have access to approximately five years of future inventory, with capital efficient arrangements representing approximately 89 percent of that supply. Our fee-for-service sales generally improve returns on invested capital and liquidity, while sales of owned inventory typically result in a greater contribution to the profitability of our real estate sales and financing segment. To maximize both returns on invested capital and earnings growth, we plan to sell a balanced mix of fee-for-service and owned inventory. 
 Owners can generally offer their VOIs for resale on the secondary market, which can create pricing pressure on the sale of developer inventory. Given the structure of our products, owners who purchase VOIs on the secondary market will also become Club members and will be responsible for paying annual Club fees, annual maintenance fees, property taxes and any assessments that are levied by the relevant HOA. While we do not have an obligation to repurchase intervals previously sold, most of our VOIs provide us with a right of first refusal on secondary market sales. We monitor sales that occur in the secondary market and exercise our right of first refusal in certain cases. 
 Marketing and Sales Activities 
 Our marketing and sales activities are based on targeted direct marketing and a highly personalized sales approach. We use targeted direct marketing to reach potential members who are identified as having the financial ability to pay for our products and have an affinity with Hilton and are frequent leisure travelers. 
 We sell our vacation ownership products under the Hilton Grand Vacations brand primarily through our distribution network of both in-market and off-site sales centers. Our products are currently marketed for sale throughout the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. We operate sales distribution centers in major markets and popular leisure destinations with year-round demand and a history of being a friendly environment for vacation ownership. We have sales distribution centers in Las Vegas, Myrtle Beach, Hilton Head, New York, Washington, D.C., Orlando, Park City, Oahu, Waikoloa and Japan. 
 4


Our Hilton Grand Vacations sales tours are designed to provide potential members with an overview of our company and our products, as well as a customized presentation to explain how our products can meet their vacationing needs. Our sales centers use proprietary sales technology to deliver a highly transparent and customized sales approach. Consumers place a great deal of trust in the Hilton brand and we believe that preserving that trust is essential. We hire our sales associates using an assessment-based, candidate screening system, which is a proprietary tool we use to uphold our selection criteria. Once hired, we emphasize training, professionalism and product knowledge, and our sales associates receive significant product and sales training before interacting with potential members. Most U.S.-based sales associates are licensed real estate agents and a real estate broker is involved with each sales center. We manage our sales associates’ consistency of presentation and professionalism using a variety of sales tools and technology and through a post-presentation survey of our tour guests that measures many aspects of each guest’s interaction with us. We do not tolerate sales activities that are not consistent with our focus on treating members and guests with the highest degree of respect. 
 Financing Activities 
 We originate loans for members purchasing our owned inventory who qualify according to our credit criteria. We generate interest income from the spread between the revenue generated on loans originated less our costs to fund and service those loans. We also earn fee revenue from servicing our own portfolio and the loans provided by third-party developers of our fee-for-service projects to purchasers of their VOIs. 
 We offer a wide array of financing options to members purchasing our VOIs. Our loans are collateralized by the underlying VOIs and are generally structured as ten-year, fully-amortizing loans that bear a fixed interest rate typically ranging from 9 percent to 18 percent per annum. In 2017, 65 percent of our sales were to customers who financed part of their purchase. The interest rate on our loans is determined by, among other factors, the amount of the down payment, the borrower’s credit profile and the loan term. Prepayment is permitted without penalty. As of December 31, 2017, the average loan outstanding was approximately $21 thousand with a weighted average interest rate of 12.2 percent.
As loan payments are made, the nature of these fully amortizing loans establishes an increasing level of owner financial commitment in their purchase which reduces the likelihood of default. When a member defaults, we ultimately return their VOI to inventory for resale, and that member no longer participates in our network. 
 We have a timeshare warehouse facility and periodically securitize timeshare financing receivables we originate in connection with the sale of VOIs to monetize receivables and achieve an efficient return on capital and manage our working capital needs. 
 Timeshare Financing Receivables Origination 
 In underwriting each loan, we obtain a credit application and review the application for completeness. We require a minimum down payment of 10 percent of the purchase price on all sales of VOIs. For U.S. and Canadian purchasers seeking financing, which represented 86 percent of the individuals we provided financing to over the last three years, we apply the credit evaluation score methodology developed by the Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) to credit files compiled and maintained by Experian and Equifax. Higher credit scores equate to lower credit risk and lower credit scores equate to higher credit risk. Over the last three years, the weighted average FICO score for new loans to U.S. and Canadian borrowers at the time of origination was 742 (out of a maximum potential score of 850). For non-North American purchasers seeking financing, consisting principally of purchasers in Japan, we generally observe that these borrowers have experienced default rates comparable to U.S. and Canadian borrowers within the 725 to 774 FICO score band. 
 Our underwriting standards are influenced by the changing economic and financial market conditions. We have the ability to modify our down payment requirements and credit thresholds in the face of stronger or weaker market conditions. Our underwriting standards have resulted in a strong, well-seasoned consumer loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, our portfolio had a balance of approximately $1.2 billion with over 57,000 loans and exhibited the following characteristics: 
 Weighted Average Original Length of Loan: 9.9 years 
 Weighted Average Remaining Length of Loan: 7.7 years

Over 30 days past due not in default: 2.1% 
 Liquidity 
 We finance our working capital needs in part by borrowing against timeshare financing receivables. In general, we seek to use the majority of our financed VOI sales as collateral to borrow against the Timeshare Facility and subsequently transfer those loans into a term securitization after the loans have seasoned and an appropriately sized portfolio has been assembled. We target securitizations that range in size from $200 million to $400 million and we expect the timing of future securitizations will depend on our anticipated sales volume and capital needs. The strong performance of our outstanding loan securitizations demonstrates that loans originated by us are well regarded for their performance in the securitization market. In the future, we expect to regularly access the term securitization market, replenishing capacity on our Timeshare Facility in the process. 
Loan Portfolio Servicing 
 We have a skilled, integrated consumer finance team. This team is responsible for payment processing and loan servicing, collections and default recovery and portfolio reporting and analytics. Accounts more than 30 days past due are deemed delinquent. We reserve for all loans based on our static pool method. A loan that is more than 120 days past due is reserved at 100 percent the following month and is delivered to the loss mitigation team that will make arrangements for any remaining outstanding payments or recommend recovery through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or foreclosure. In the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure process, the member deeds the VOI back to us. For domestic owners, this process varies from state to state and typically takes approximately 60 to 120 days, after which time we are able to resell the foreclosed VOI. 
 We monitor numerous metrics including collection rates, defaults and bankruptcies. Our consumer finance team also is responsible for selecting and processing loans pledged or to be pledged in our securitizations and preparing monthly servicing reports. 
 Resort and Club Management Activities 
 Resort Management 
 Prior to the initiation of VOI sales at a timeshare resort developed by us or by a third party with whom we have entered into a fee-for-service agreement, we enter into a management agreement with the relevant HOA. Each of the HOAs is governed by a board of directors comprising owner or developer representatives that are charged with ensuring that the resorts are well-maintained and financially stable. Our services include day-to-day operations of the resorts, maintenance of the resorts, preparation of reports, budgets and projections and employee training and oversight. Our HOA management agreements provide for a cost-plus management fee, which means we generally earn a fee equal to 10 percent to 15 percent of the costs to operate the applicable resort. As a result, the fees we earn are highly predictable, unlike traditional revenue-based hotel management fees, our management fees generally are unaffected by changes in rental rate or occupancy. Further, because maintenance fees are paid annually by owners, our management fees are recurring and less volatile than hotel management fees. We also are reimbursed for the costs incurred to perform our services, principally related to personnel providing on-site services. The original term of our management agreements is typically governed by state timeshare laws and ranges from three to five years. The agreements generally are subject to automatic renewal for one- to three-year periods unless either party provides advance notice of termination before the expiration of the term. Since our inception in 1992, none of the management agreements relating to our developed or fee-for-service properties have been terminated or lapsed. 
 To fund resort operations, owners are assessed an annual maintenance fee, which includes our management fee. In 2017, HOAs collected approximately $359 million in maintenance fees, including our applicable management fees. Because these funds are collected early in the year, we have substantial visibility and reliability of collection. These fees represent each owner’s allocable share of the management fee and the costs of operating and maintaining the resorts, which generally includes personnel, property taxes, insurance, a capital asset reserve to fund refurbishment and other related costs. If a VOI owner defaults on payment of its maintenance fees and there is no lien against the mortgage note, the HOA has the right to recover the defaulting owner’s VOI. As a service to HOAs at our owned resorts, subject to our inventory needs, we have the ability to reduce the bad debt expense at the HOAs 
 6


by assuming the defaulted owner’s obligations in exchange for an agreed purchase price. We are then able to resell those VOIs through our normal distribution channels. 
 A portion of the annual maintenance fees collected from owners each year is set aside for property renovations. The renovations funded by these fees enable HOAs to keep properties modern, which helps the properties consistently receive the highest quality assurance scores across the Hilton brands. HOAs engage an independent consulting firm to compile a reserve study. Typically, HOAs budget the reserve study to target property renovations on a six- and 12-year cycle. HOAs generally replace soft goods every six years and hard goods every 12 years. These reserves also benefit our members by limiting the risk of special assessments and steep increases in maintenance fees due to deferred capital expenditures. 
 Club Management 
 We also manage and operate the points-based Hilton Grand Vacations Club and Hilton Club exchange programs, which provided exclusive exchange, leisure travel and reservation services to approximately 288,000 members as of December 31, 2017. When an owner purchases a VOI, he or she is enrolled in the Club and allotted a number of points that represent his or her ownership interest and allow the member to exchange his or her annual usage rights for a number of vacation and travel options available through the club. The Hilton Club operates at the Hilton New York and the The District for its VOI owners, who also enjoy exchange benefits with the Hilton Grand Vacations Club. In addition to an annual membership fee, club members pay incremental fees depending on the type of exchange they choose within the club system. 
Rental of Available Inventory 
 We rent unsold owned and fee-for-service VOI inventory and inventory made available due to ownership exchanges through our Club programs. By using our website, Hilton’s websites and other direct booking channels to rent available inventory, we are able to reach potential new members that may already have an affinity for and loyalty to the Hilton brands and introduce them to our products. Inventory rentals allow us to utilize otherwise unoccupied inventory to generate additional revenues and provision of ancillary services. We earn a fee from rentals of third-party inventory. 
Competition 
 The timeshare industry has historically been highly competitive and comprised a number of national and regional companies that develop, finance and operate timeshare properties. 
 Our timeshare business competes with other timeshare developers for sales of VOIs based principally on location, quality of accommodations, price, service levels and amenities, financing terms, quality of service, terms of property use, reservation systems, flexibility for members to exchange into time at other timeshare properties or other travel rewards, including access to hotel loyalty programs, as well as brand name recognition and reputation. We also compete for property acquisitions and partnerships with entities that have similar investment objectives as we do. There is also significant competition for talent at all levels within the industry, in particular for sales and management. Our primary competitors in the timeshare space include Marriott Vacations Worldwide, Wyndham Vacation Ownership, Vistana Signature Experiences, Disney Vacation Club, Hyatt Vacation Ownership, Holiday Inn Club Vacations, Bluegreen Vacations and Diamond Resorts International. 
 In addition, our timeshare business competes with other entities engaged in the leisure and vacation industry, including resorts, hotels, cruises and other accommodation alternatives, such as condominium and single-family home rentals. We also compete with home and apartment sharing services that operate websites that market available privately owned residential properties that can be rented on a nightly, weekly or monthly basis. In certain markets, we compete with established independent timeshare operators, and it is possible that other potential competitors may develop properties near our current resort locations. In addition, we face competition from other timeshare management companies in the management of resorts on behalf of owners on the basis of quality, cost, types of services offered and relationship. 
 Recent and potential future consolidation in the highly fragmented timeshare industry may increase competition. For example, Interval Leisure Group, Inc., which operates the Interval International exchange program, 
 7


acquired Hyatt Residence Club in October 2014 and in May 2016 acquired the timeshare operations of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (which includes the use of Westin and Sheraton brands for timeshare purposes), known as Vistana Signature Experiences, Inc. Diamond Resorts International, Inc. completed the acquisition of the timeshare business of Gold Key Resorts in October 2015 and completed the acquisition of the timeshare business of Intrawest Resort Club Group in January 2016. Consolidation may create competitors that enjoy significant advantages resulting from, among other things, a lower cost of, and greater access to, capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. 
 We generally do not face competition in our consumer financing business to finance sales of our VOIs. We do face competition from financial institutions providing other forms of consumer credit, which may lead to full or partial prepayment of our timeshare financing receivables. 
 Seasonality and Cyclicality 
 We experience modest seasonality in timeshare sales at certain resorts, with stronger revenue generation during traditional vacation periods for those locations. Our business is moderately cyclical as the demand for VOIs is affected by the availability and cost of financing for purchases of VOIs, as well as general economic conditions and the relative health of the travel industry and housing market. 
Intellectual Property 
 In connection with the spin-off, we entered into a license agreement with Hilton which grants us the right to use certain Hilton-branded trademarks, trade names and related intellectual property in our business for the term of the agreement. The license agreement provides us with, among other things, the exclusive license to design, build, manage and maintain existing and future timeshare resorts under the Hilton Grand Vacations brand throughout the world, subject to Hilton’s consent in certain circumstances. See “Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off—License Agreement” for more information. In the competitive industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos are very important to the marketing and sales of our products. We believe that the licensed marks and related intellectual property have come to represent the highest standards of quality, service and value to our members, guests, employees and those with whom we have business relationships. We have applied and will continue to apply to register our trademarks in markets in which we conduct business. We will enforce our rights against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties and otherwise protect our intellectual property through strategies and in jurisdictions we deem appropriate. 
Government Regulation 
 Our business is subject to various international, national, federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies in jurisdictions in which we operate. Some laws, regulations and policies impact multiple areas of our business, such as securities, anti-discrimination, anti-fraud, data protection and security and anti-corruption and bribery laws and regulations or government economic sanctions, including applicable regulations under the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). The FCPA and similar anti-corruption and bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or generating business. Other laws, regulations and policies primarily affect one of our areas of business: real estate development activities; marketing and sales activities; financial services activities; and resort management activities. 
Real Estate Development Regulation 
 Our real estate development activities are regulated under a number of different timeshare, condominium and land sales disclosure statutes in many jurisdictions. We are generally subject to laws and regulations typically applicable to real estate development, subdivision and construction activities, such as laws relating to zoning, land use restrictions, environmental regulation, accessibility, title transfers, title insurance and taxation. In the United States, these include the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Accessibility Guidelines promulgated thereunder, which we refer to collectively as (the “ADA”). In addition, we are subject to laws in some jurisdictions that impose liability on property developers for construction defects discovered or repairs made by future owners of property developed by the developer. 
 8


Marketing and Sales Regulation 
 Our marketing and sales activities are highly regulated. In addition to regulations implementing laws enacted specifically for the timeshare industry, a wide variety of laws and regulations govern our marketing and sales activities, including regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act, Foreign Investment In Real Property Tax Act, the Federal Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act and fair housing statutes, U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and state “Little FTC Act” and other regulations governing unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices including unfair or deceptive trade practices and unfair competition, state attorney general regulations, anti-fraud laws, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, real estate, title agency or insurance and other licensing or registration laws and regulations, anti-money laundering, consumer information privacy and security, breach notification, information sharing and telemarketing laws, home solicitation sales laws, tour operator laws, lodging certificate and seller of travel laws, securities laws, and other consumer protection laws. 
 We must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities for our marketing and sales activities. Changes in circumstances or applicable law may necessitate the application for or modification of existing approvals. In addition, many jurisdictions, including many jurisdictions in the United States, require that we file detailed registration or offering statements with regulatory authorities disclosing information regarding our VOIs, such as information concerning the intervals being offered, the project, resort or program to which the intervals relate, applicable timeshare plans, evidence of title, details regarding our business, the purchaser’s rights and obligations with respect to such intervals, and a description of the manner in which we intend to offer and advertise such intervals. 
 When we sell VOIs, local law grants the purchaser of a VOI the right to cancel a purchase contract during a specified rescission period following the later of the date the contract was signed or the date the purchaser received the last of the documents required to be provided by us. 
 In recent years, regulators in many jurisdictions have increased regulations and enforcement actions related to telemarketing operations, including requiring adherence to the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act and “do not call” legislation. These measures have significantly increased the costs associated with telemarketing, in particular with respect to telemarketing to mobile numbers. While we continue to be subject to telemarketing risks and potential liability, we believe that our exposure to adverse effects from telemarketing legislation and enforcement is mitigated in some instances by the use of permission-based marketing in which we obtain permission to contact prospective purchasers in the future. We have also implemented procedures to comply with federal and state “do not call” regulations including subscribing to the federal do not call registry and certain state “do not call” registries as well as maintaining an internal “do not call” list. 
 Lending Regulation 
 Our lending activities are subject to a number of laws and regulations including those of applicable supervisory agencies such as, in the United States, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the FTC, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These laws and regulations, some of which contain exceptions applicable to the timeshare industry, may include, among others, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, the Truth In Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act and implementing regulations, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices regulations and the Credit Practices rules, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Servicemember’s Civil Relief Act and the Bank Secrecy Act. Our lending activities are also subject to the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, including, among others, laws and regulations related to consumer loans, retail installment contracts, mortgage lending, fair debt collection and credit reporting practices, consumer debt collection practices, mortgage disclosure, lender or mortgage loan originator licensing and registration and anti-money laundering. 
Resort Management Regulation 
 Our resort management activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding community association management, public lodging, food and beverage services, liquor licensing, labor, employment, health care, health and safety, accessibility, discrimination, immigration, gaming and the environment (including climate change). In 
 9


addition, many jurisdictions in which we manage our resorts have statutory provisions that limit the duration of the initial and renewal terms of our management agreements for HOAs. 
 Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various U.S. federal, state and local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and incur costs in complying with such requirements. The costs of complying with these requirements are generally covered by the HOAs that operate the affected resort property and are our responsibility for assets owned by us. These laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and wastewater disposal. In addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws, we may also face personal injury, property damage, fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination. We use and store hazardous and toxic substances, such as cleaning materials, pool chemicals, heating oil and fuel for back-up generators at some of our facilities, and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations. Some of our properties include, and some of our future properties may include, older buildings, and some may have, or may historically have had, dry-cleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and back-up generators. We have, from time to time, been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities, such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks, and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of wastes that we generate, including at locations where such wastes have been sent for disposal. In some cases, we may be entitled to indemnification from the party that caused the contamination pursuant to our management, construction or renovation agreements, but there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any costs we incur in addressing such problems. From time to time, we may also be required to manage, abate, remove or contain mold, lead, asbestos-containing materials, radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties. We have implemented an on-going operations and maintenance plan at each of our properties that seeks to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate. Although we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, costs relating to the investigation, identification and remediation of hazardous materials known or discovered to exist at our properties, those costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Spin-Off Transactions 
 
On February 26, 2016, Hilton announced that its Board of Directors had unanimously approved a plan to enhance long-term stockholder value by separating Hilton into three independent, publicly traded companies. Hilton subsequently executed tax-free spin-offs of HGV and Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. (“Park”), which holds a portfolio of Hilton’s owned and leased hotels and resorts. 
 
On January 3, 2017, the spin-offs were completed, and we became a separate publicly-traded company. In connection with the completion of the spin-off, we entered into agreements with Hilton and other third parties, including licenses to use the Hilton brand, which did not exist historically. For more information regarding these agreements, see “—Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off.” 
 
In connection with the spin-off, we entered into a registration rights agreement with Blackstone (which became effective upon the consummation of the spin-off) and a stockholders agreement with Blackstone which is substantially the same as Blackstone’s stockholders agreement with Hilton.
 
On October 24, 2016, Hilton, The Blackstone Group L.P. and its affiliates (“Blackstone”) and HNA Tourism Group Co., Ltd. (“HNA”) announced that affiliates of Blackstone agreed to sell to HNA 24,750,000 shares of common stock of Hilton, representing approximately 25 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of Hilton, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement between HNA and Blackstone (the “Sale”). The Sale closed on March 15, 2017. The Sale included 25 percent of the shares of our common stock and Park’s common stock, which were received by Blackstone in the spin-off. 
 
In connection with the Sale, we entered into a stockholders agreement and a registration rights agreement with HNA, which became effective upon the closing of the Sale. See “—Agreements with Blackstone and HNA—HNA Stockholders Agreement,” “—Blackstone Stockholders Agreement” and “—Registration Rights Agreements” for more detailed descriptions of these agreements.
 Transactions with Blackstone Subsequent to Spin-off
 
On May 25, 2017, Blackstone filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 and registered all of our common stock held by them.  On June 14, 2017, Blackstone entered into an underwriting agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC pursuant to which J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to purchase from Blackstone 9,650,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $35.40 per share.  The sale was completed on June 20, 2017.  Subsequently, on September 25, 2017, Blackstone completed the sale of substantially all of the remaining shares of our common stock held by them to several institutional investors.  We did not receive any proceeds from either of these sales.  As a result of these sales, Blackstone holds only a nominal number of shares of our common stock.
 
In July 2017, we entered into an agreement with BRE Ace Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of Blackstone, and formed BRE Ace LLC. Pursuant to the agreement, we contributed $40 million in cash for a 25 percent interest in BRE Ace LLC, which owns a 1,201-key timeshare resort property and related operations, commonly known as “Elara, by Hilton Grand Vacations,” located in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
 Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off 
 
This section summarizes the material agreements between us and Hilton (and, in certain cases, Park and certain affiliates of Blackstone and HNA) that govern the ongoing relationships between us and these parties which we have entered into in connection with the spin-off.  Additional or modified agreements, arrangements and transactions, which would be negotiated at arm’s length, may be entered into between us and these parties in the future.  These summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the applicable agreements, which are filed as exhibits hereto.
 
As of January 3, 2017 when the spin-off was completed, we and Hilton now operate independently, and neither has any ownership interest in the other.  To govern certain ongoing relationships between us and Hilton and to 
 11


provide mechanisms for an orderly transition, we, Hilton and Park entered into agreements pursuant to which certain services and rights are provided for following the spin-off, and we, Hilton and Park will indemnify each other against certain liabilities arising from our respective businesses.  We also entered into stockholders agreements and registration rights agreements with Blackstone and HNA.  The following is a summary of the terms of the material agreements we have entered into with Hilton, Park, Blackstone and HNA.
 The following summaries do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of each agreement, which is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibits 2.1, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.6, 10.7, 10.25, 10.26, 10.27, 10.28 and 10.29.
 Distribution Agreement

 We entered into a Distribution Agreement with Hilton and Park prior to the distribution of our shares of common stock to Hilton stockholders (the “Distribution Agreement”).  The Distribution Agreement sets forth our agreements with Hilton and Park regarding the principal actions taken in connection with our spin-off from Hilton.  It also sets forth other agreements that govern certain aspects of our relationship with Hilton and Park following the spin-off.
 The Distribution Agreement provides for certain transfers of assets and assumptions of liabilities by each of us, Hilton and Park.  The Distribution Agreement also provides for the settlement or extinguishment of certain liabilities and other obligations among us, Hilton and Park.  In particular, the Distribution Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Distribution Agreement:
  
• | all of the assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) associated with the timeshare business have been retained by or transferred to us or our subsidiaries;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | all of the assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) associated with the separated real estate business have been retained by or transferred to Park or its subsidiaries;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | all other assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) of Hilton have been retained by or transferred to Hilton or its subsidiaries;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise) related to, arising out of or resulting from businesses of Hilton that were previously terminated or divested have been allocated among the parties to the extent formerly owned or managed by or associated with such parties or their respective businesses;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | each of us and Park has assumed or retained any liabilities (including under applicable federal and state securities laws) relating to, arising out of or resulting from the filing of the Form 10 registration statement registering its respective common stock which was distributed by Hilton in the spin-off and from any disclosure documents that offered for sale securities in transactions related to the spin-off, subject to exceptions for certain information for which Hilton has retained liability; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | except as otherwise provided in the Distribution Agreement or any ancillary agreement, Hilton is generally be responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by each of us, Hilton and Park in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Distribution Agreement, including costs and expenses relating to legal counsel, financial advisors and accounting advisory work related to the distribution.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, notwithstanding the allocation described above, we, Park and Hilton agreed that losses related to certain contingent liabilities (and related costs and expenses) are to be apportioned among the parties according to fixed percentages of 65 percent, 26 percent, and nine percent for each of Hilton, Park, and us, respectively.  Examples of shared contingent liabilities include uninsured losses arising from actions (including derivative actions) against current or former directors or officers of Hilton or its subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the completion of the spin-off, or against current or former directors or officers of any of Hilton, Park or us, 
 12


or of their respective subsidiaries, arising out of, in connection with, or otherwise relating to, the spin-off, subject to certain exceptions described in the Distribution Agreement.  In addition, costs and expenses of, and indemnification obligations to, third party professional advisors arising out of the foregoing actions may also be subject to these provisions.  Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, Hilton is generally vested with the exclusive management and control of all matters pertaining to any such shared contingent liabilities, including the prosecution of any claim and the conduct of any defense.  The Distribution Agreement also provides for cross-indemnities that, except as otherwise provided in the Distribution Agreement, are principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of each business with the appropriate company.
 To the extent that any transfers of assets or assumptions of liabilities contemplated by the Distribution Agreement were not consummated on or prior to the date of the distribution, the parties have agreed to cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such transfers or assumptions as promptly as practicable following the date of the distribution.  In addition, each of the parties has agreed to cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to take or to cause to be taken all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary under applicable law or contractual obligations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the Distribution Agreement and the ancillary agreements.
 In general, neither we, Park nor Hilton made any representations or warranties regarding any assets or liabilities transferred or assumed, any consents or approvals that may have been required in connection with such transfers or assumptions, the value or freedom from any lien or other security interest of any assets transferred, the absence of any defenses relating to any claim of either party or the legal sufficiency of any conveyance documents, or any other matters.  Except as expressly set forth in the Distribution Agreement or any ancillary agreement, all assets were transferred on an “as is,” “where is” basis.
 The Distribution Agreement governs the rights and obligations of the parties regarding the distribution and certain actions that were required to occur prior to the distribution, such as the election of officers and directors and the adoption of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws.  Prior to the distribution, we issued shares of our common stock to Hilton in a stock split, to the extent necessary to ensure that Hilton held the necessary number of shares of our common stock required to be distributed in the distribution.  Hilton caused the distribution agent to distribute to Hilton stockholders that held shares of Hilton common stock as of the applicable record date all of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock.  Hilton had the sole and absolute discretion to determine (and change) the terms of, and whether to proceed with, the distribution and to determine the date of the distribution.
 We, Park and Hilton agreed to broad releases pursuant to which we, Park and Hilton each released the others and certain related persons specified in the Distribution Agreement from any claims against any of them that arise out of or relate to acts or events occurring or failing to occur or alleged to occur or to have failed to occur or any conditions existing or alleged to have existed at or prior to the time of the distribution.  These releases are subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Distribution Agreement and the ancillary agreements.
 The Distribution Agreement provides for cross-indemnities that, except as otherwise provided in the Distribution Agreement, are principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us, financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of the business of Park with Park and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of Hilton’s business with Hilton.  Specifically, each party will, and will cause its subsidiaries and affiliates to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each other party, its affiliates and subsidiaries and each of its officers, directors, employees and agents for any losses arising out of or otherwise in connection with:
  
• | the liabilities or alleged liabilities each such party assumed or retained pursuant to the Distribution Agreement; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any breach by such party of the Distribution Agreement or any ancillary agreement unless such ancillary agreement expressly provides for separate indemnification therein, in which case any such indemnification claims will be made thereunder.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13


The amount of each party’s indemnification obligations is subject to reduction by any insurance proceeds received by the party being indemnified and by any proceeds received from a third party for indemnification for such liability.  The Distribution Agreement also specifies procedures with respect to claims subject to indemnification and related matters.  Indemnification with respect to taxes is governed solely by the Tax Matters Agreement.
 In the event of any dispute arising out of the Distribution Agreement, the general counsels of the disputing parties, and/or such other representatives as such parties designate, will negotiate to resolve any disputes among such parties.  If the disputing parties are unable to resolve the dispute in this manner within a specified period of time, as set forth in the Distribution Agreement, then unless agreed otherwise by such parties, the disputing parties will submit the dispute to mediation for an additional specified period of time, as set forth in the Distribution Agreement.  If the disputing parties are unable to resolve the dispute in this manner, the dispute may be resolved through legal proceedings as set forth in the Distribution Agreement.
 Other matters governed by the Distribution Agreement include access to financial and other information, intellectual property, confidentiality, access to and provision of records and treatment of outstanding guarantees and similar credit support.
 License Agreement
 Under our license arrangement with Hilton prior to the spin-off, we licensed the Hilton Grand Vacations brand and paid Hilton an annual fee based on a percentage of revenue for rights to operate under this brand.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred license fee expense of $87 million.  Under our Honors® program arrangement with Hilton prior to the spin-off, we purchased Hilton Honors® points from Hilton based on an estimated cost per point for the costs of future club exchanges.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid Hilton $59 million, respectively for Hilton Honors® points.
 In connection with the spin-off, we entered into a license agreement with Hilton granting us the right to use certain Hilton trademarks and other intellectual property in our business.  The license agreement grants us the exclusive right, for an initial term of 100 years, to use certain Hilton marks and intellectual property in our timeshare business.
 Subject to the terms and conditions of the license agreement, Hilton has granted us the right to use the trademarks “Hilton Grand Vacations,” “HGV” and “Hilton Club” (collectively, the “Hilton Marks”) in connection with the current and future operation of a Hilton branded vacation ownership business (the “Licensed Business”).  We have also received a license or right to use certain other Hilton-owned intellectual property, including promotional content and access to Hilton’s reservation system and property management software (collectively with the Hilton Marks, the “Hilton IP”).  We also have the right to use Hilton’s loyalty program data and other customer information (“Hilton Data”) to promote the Licensed Business and for other internal business purposes, but may not disclose or sell such information to third parties without Hilton’s consent.
 Subject to the following two sentences, Hilton will not compete or use the Hilton IP or Hilton Data in the vacation ownership business (or license others to do so) for the first 30 years of the term of the license agreement, and we may extend this exclusivity for additional 10-year terms if we achieve certain revenue targets in the last year of the initial 30-year term or any subsequent renewal term, or make a payment to cover any revenue shortfall, for a maximum of five such payments during any 10-year renewal term.  If Hilton merges with or acquires a company that owns a vacation ownership business and a hotel business, Hilton shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow us to acquire or manage the acquired vacation ownership business.  If we do not do so, then after such acquisition by Hilton, notwithstanding the foregoing exclusivity, Hilton may use the Hilton IP, Hilton Data and Hilton’s loyalty program (but not the Hilton Marks) to allow such acquired vacation ownership business to compete with the Licensed Business for the remainder of the term of the license agreement.
 The initial term of the license agreement will expire on December 31, 2116.  After the initial term ends, we may continue to use the Hilton IP and Hilton Data on a non-exclusive basis for a “tail period” of 30 years in connection with products and projects that were using the foregoing rights, or were approved by Hilton for 
 14


development, when the term ended, provided that we continue to comply with the terms of the license agreement, including payment of royalty and other fees.
 We pay a royalty fee of five percent of gross revenues to Hilton quarterly in arrears, as well as specified additional fees.  Gross revenues include our gross sales for the initial sale or re-sale of interests in the Licensed Business (subject to certain HGV Club exceptions), property operations revenue, transient rental revenue and other certain revenues earned.  We also owe Hilton an annual transition fee of $5 million for each of the first five years of the term and certain other fees and reimbursements.  The license agreement contains customary requirements with respect to our record-keeping and Hilton’s audit rights.
 We are required to comply with the Hilton brand standards applicable to the Licensed Business.  Hilton has inspection and approval rights to monitor our compliance with these standards.  Hilton brand standards include: construction and design brand standards; graphic standards for use of the Hilton IP; sales, service and operating standards; and quality assurance and customer satisfaction requirements.
 During the term of the license agreement, we will participate in Hilton’s loyalty program, currently known as the Hilton Honors® program.  We can purchase Hilton Honors® points at cost for the first 20 years of the term of the license agreement, and thereafter at the market rate (with a most favored nation provision, pursuant to which such market rate is no higher than the price paid by strategic partners that purchase a comparable volume of points annually on comparable business terms).  All members of Hilton’s loyalty program have the right to redeem loyalty program points at our properties in the Licensed Business, consistent with the tiers and rules of Hilton’s current loyalty program.  We can convert points associated with our own point-based reservations and exchange system into Hilton loyalty program points through an exchange program at a conversion rate to be determined by us.  We may not participate in a loyalty program of a Hilton competitor in connection with the Licensed Business.
 We are required to operate the Licensed Business in strict compliance with all of Hilton’s standards and guidelines and all applicable laws.  We are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all necessary approvals, permits and licenses required and paying all taxes related to the Licensed Business.  We may subcontract or delegate property-level, non-management functions, including housekeeping, security and maintenance, as long as we comply with Hilton’s standards and guidelines.  Hilton has the right to enter our vacation ownership properties at any time without notice and additional permission from us in order to verify that we are complying with the license agreement and Hilton’s standards and guidelines.
 We are required to comply with Hilton’s customer data privacy and security standards and protocols.  We are required to notify Hilton immediately after discovering any actual or attempted circumstances that could compromise the security of our information technology systems.  We are required to remedy any such breach at our own expense.
 We are able to operate vacation ownership properties under other brands (with no royalty due to Hilton) if we do so without using any Hilton IP or Hilton Data and they are otherwise separate operations from the Licensed Business.
 We are required to obtain Hilton’s consent to develop or operate any additional vacation ownership properties under the Hilton Marks (including on our own undeveloped parcels).  Hilton may not unreasonably withhold its approval for these projects as long as they comply with existing law, do not involve a co-investor that is a competitor of Hilton or is of bad moral character, and are not reasonably likely to harm Hilton, the Licensed IP or the Hilton Data.  Hilton has a right of first refusal if we want to sell an undeveloped parcel to a Hilton competitor.
 We have entered into an agreement with Hilton that governs the transfer of calls from Hilton to us.  Under this agreement, Hilton is required to use its reasonable best efforts to transfer calls to us at a level consistent with past practice prior to the spin-off for the first ten years.  Hilton is required to provide the call transfer services at cost for the first 30 years and at market rates thereafter.  We have entered into other agreements that govern other services that Hilton is required to provide us.
 15


Under the license agreement, our right to use the Hilton Marks as a trade, corporate, d/b/a or similar name will automatically terminate if (i) the aggregate number of units of accommodation in our Licensed Business falls below two-thirds of the total number of units of accommodation in our entire vacation ownership business; (ii) we merge with or acquire control of the assets of Marriott International, Inc., Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, Wyndham Worldwide Corporation and Interval Leisure Group, Inc.  or their respective affiliates and we or they use their brands in any business after such acquisition; or (iii) we become an affiliate of another Hilton competitor.
 Hilton has the right to terminate the license agreement as a whole if, among other things: (i) we file for bankruptcy or cease business operations; (ii) 25 percent or more of our Hilton-branded vacation ownership properties fail certain performance thresholds or the overall customer satisfaction score for all our Hilton-branded vacation ownership properties falls below a certain threshold level, and we do not promptly cure such failures; (iii) we operate the Licensed Business in a way that has a material adverse effect on Hilton; (iv) we fail to pay certain amounts due to Hilton (and in certain cases, do not promptly cure such failures); (v) we contest Hilton’s ownership of the Hilton IP or the Hilton Data; (vi) we merge with, consolidate with or are acquired by a competitor of Hilton; or (vii) we assign the agreement to a non-affiliate without Hilton’s consent.
 Hilton also has the right to “deflag” (prevent use of any Hilton IP or Hilton Data at) any property in our Licensed Business in certain circumstances, including if (i) a $10 million or more final judgment is assessed against such property or a foreclosure suit is initiated against such property and not vacated; (ii) an ongoing threat or danger to public health or safety occurs at such property; (iii) such property fails to meet certain quality assurance system performance thresholds; or (iv) such property is not operated in compliance with the license agreement or Hilton’s other standards and agreements, and such breaches are not cured in accordance with the license agreement.
 If we breach our obligations under the license agreement, Hilton may, in addition to terminating the license agreement, be entitled to (depending on the nature of the breach): seek injunctive relief and/or monetary damages; suspend our access to and terminate our rights to use Licensed IP and/or Hilton Data (other than the Hilton Marks and certain other content); or terminate our rights to use the Licensed IP (including the Hilton Marks) and Hilton Data at specific locations that are not in compliance with performance standards.
 If the license agreement terminates due to our fault before the end of the term, we are required to cease use of the Hilton IP and Hilton Data according to a specified schedule.  Hilton has the right to demand liquidated damages based upon its uncollected royalties and fees for the remainder of the term.
 Hilton has registered certain of the Hilton Marks for vacation ownership services in jurisdictions in which we currently operate vacation ownership resorts and residential projects under the Hilton Marks.  However, Hilton does not have affirmative trademark rights in the Hilton Marks in relation to every aspect of our business in every country around the world, and we, therefore, may not be able to use one or more of the Hilton Marks to expand various aspects of our business into one or more new countries.  If we want to use a Hilton Mark in a country where it is not registered, we will have to seek Hilton’s consent, which may not be withheld if the new trademark would not reasonably be expected to harm or jeopardize the value, validity, reputation or goodwill of the Hilton Marks or subject Hilton to any risk of legal liability.
 Unless we obtain Hilton’s prior written consent, we may not be able to: (i) merge with or acquire a Hilton competitor or a vacation ownership business that has entered into an operating agreement with a Hilton competitor; (ii) merge with or acquire a vacation ownership business together with a lodging business; or (iii) be acquired or combined with any entity other than an affiliate.  We may acquire control of a business that is not a vacation ownership business or a lodging business without Hilton’s consent, but we are required to operate such business as a separate operation that does not use the Hilton IP or Hilton Data unless Hilton consents to such use.  Without Hilton’s prior consent, we may not assign our rights under the license agreement, except to one our affiliates as part of an internal reorganization for tax or administrative purposes.
 We are required to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Hilton from and against any claim or liability resulting from (i) third-party claims based on (ii) our breach of the license agreement; (iii) the operation of our vacation ownership properties; (iv) any use of the Hilton IP or Hilton Data in violation of the license agreement; or (v) claims based on any security breach of our systems and/or unauthorized use or disclosure of Hilton Data.

Employee Matters Agreement
 We have entered into an Employee Matters Agreement with Hilton and Park that governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Hilton, Park and us after the spin-off with respect to transferred employees, defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, non-qualified retirement plans, employee health and welfare benefit plans, incentive plans, equity-based awards, collective bargaining agreements and other employment, compensation and benefits-related matters (the “Employee Matters Agreement”).  The Employee Matters Agreement provides for, among other things, the allocation and treatment of assets and liabilities arising out of incentive plans, retirement plans and employee health and welfare benefit plans in which our and Park’s employees participated prior to the spin-off, and continued participation by our and Park’s employees in certain of Hilton’s compensation and benefit plans for a specified period of time following the spin-off.  Generally, other than with respect to certain specified compensation and benefit plans and liabilities, we and Park have assumed or retained sponsorship of, and the liabilities relating to, compensation and benefit plans and employee-related liabilities relating to its respective current and former employees.  The Employee Matters Agreement also provides that then outstanding Hilton equity-based awards were equitably adjusted or converted into HGV or Park awards, as applicable, in connection with the spin-off.  After the spin-off, our and Park’s employees no longer actively participate in Hilton’s benefit plans or programs (other than specified compensation and benefit plans), and we and Park have each established or will establish plans or programs for our and Park’s employees, respectively, as described in the Employee Matters Agreement.  We and Park also have established or will establish or maintain plans and programs outside of the United States as may be required under applicable law or pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement.
Tax Matters Agreement
 We have entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with Hilton and Park that govern the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Hilton, Park and us after the spin-off with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S.  federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns.  Although binding between the parties, the Tax Matters Agreement is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).  We and Park each will continue to have several liabilities with Hilton to the IRS for the consolidated U.S. federal income taxes of the Hilton consolidated group relating to the taxable periods in which we and Park were part of that group.  The Tax Matters Agreement specifies the portion, if any, of this tax liability for which we and Park will bear responsibility, and each party has agreed to indemnify the other two parties against any amounts for which they are not responsible.  The Tax Matters Agreement also provides special rules for allocating tax liabilities in the event that the spin-off is not tax-free.  In general, under the Tax Matters Agreement, each party is responsible for any taxes imposed on Hilton that arise from the failure of the spin-off and certain related transactions to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S.  federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, as applicable, and certain other relevant provisions of the Code, to the extent that the failure to qualify is attributable to actions taken by such party (or with respect to such party’s stock).  The parties share responsibility, in accordance with sharing percentages of 65 percent for Hilton, 26 percent for Park, and nine percent for us, for any such taxes imposed on Hilton that are not attributable to actions taken by a party.
 The Tax Matters Agreement also provides for certain covenants that may restrict our ability to issue equity and pursue strategic or other transactions that otherwise could maximize the value of our business, including, for two years after the spin-off:
  
• | engaging in any transaction involving the acquisition of shares of our stock or in certain issuances of shares of our stock;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | merging or consolidating with any other person or dissolving or liquidating in whole or in part;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | selling or otherwise disposing of, or allowing the sale or other disposition of, more than 35 percent of our consolidated gross or net assets; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | repurchasing our shares, except in certain circumstances.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 17


These restrictions are generally inapplicable in the event that the IRS has granted a favorable ruling to us, Hilton or Park or in the event that we, Hilton or Park have received an opinion from a tax advisor, in either case to the effect that it can take such actions without adversely affecting the tax-free status of the spin-off and related transactions.
 Transition Services Agreement
 We have entered into a Transition Services Agreement with Hilton and Park under which Hilton or one of its affiliates provides us and Park with certain services for a limited time to help ensure an orderly transition following the spin-off (the “Transition Services Agreement”).
 The services that Hilton has agreed to provide to us and Park under the Transition Services Agreement include certain finance, information technology, human resources and compensation, facilities, legal and compliance and other services.  We and Park have agreed to pay Hilton for any such services utilized at agreed amounts as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement.  In addition, for a specified term, we or Park and Hilton may mutually agree on additional services that were provided by Hilton prior to the completion of the spin-off at pricing based on market rates that are reasonably agreed to by the parties.
 Agreements with Blackstone and HNA
 HNA Stockholders Agreement
 In connection with the Sale, we entered into a stockholders agreement with HNA (and with HNA Group Co., Ltd. for purposes of the standstill provision only) that became effective upon the closing of the Sale.
 Under the HNA stockholders agreement, for so long as HNA beneficially owns at least 15 percent of our outstanding common stock, it will have the right to designate two directors to our board of directors, only one of which may be affiliated with HNA (but not its hospitality business) and the other of which must meet the independence standards of the NYSE with respect to our company and not have been, for two years, an employee, director or officer of, or consultant to, HNA or any of its affiliates. Each of HNA’s director designees must be reasonably satisfactory to our nominating and corporate governance committee. In addition, so long as HNA owns at least 20 percent of our outstanding common stock, HNA will have the right to designate an additional independent director to fill each third additional director seat above 10 directors; for example, if we were to increase the size of our board of directors in the future to 13, HNA would have the right to designate an independent director as the 13th member of the board of directors. HNA’s right to designate directors declines to one director when HNA’s ownership falls below 15 percent of our outstanding common stock and such right terminates when HNA’s ownership falls below five percent of our outstanding common stock, subject to certain exceptions. Each independent designee will be entitled to serve on at least one standing committee of the board of directors, as determined by the nominating and corporate governance committee.
 Following the consummation of the Sale, we increased the size of our board of directors to ten members. Two members of our board of directors, Yasheng Huang and Kenneth Tai Lun Wong, were designated by HNA pursuant to the stockholders agreement.
 The HNA stockholders agreement generally requires HNA to vote all of its shares in excess of 15 percent of our total outstanding shares in the same proportion as the shares owned by other stockholders are voted on all matters, except as follows: (i) in uncontested elections of directors, HNA is required to vote all of its shares either in favor of the board’s nominees or all of its shares in the same proportion as the shares owned by other stockholders are voted; (ii) in contested elections of directors, HNA is required to vote all of its shares in the same proportion as the shares owned by other stockholders are voted; (iii) for two years after the closing of the sale, in third-party acquisitions of our company in which both (x) shares of our common stock are exchanged for or are converted into the right to receive (A) solely cash or (B) a mixture of cash and stock of a person other than an HNA entity in which the value of the cash portion of the aggregate consideration is 60 percent or more of the value of the aggregate consideration and (y) the value of the consideration to be received per share of common stock is less than or equal to a reference price per share of our common stock calculated in accordance with the HNA stockholders agreement,

HNA may vote all of its shares as it chooses; (iv) for any acquisition of our company other than an acquisition described in (iii) above or an acquisition by HNA, HNA will vote all of its shares in excess of 15 percent of our total outstanding shares in proportion to the manner in which non-HNA holders vote their shares; and (v) in the case of any charter or bylaw amendment which adversely affects HNA disproportionally as compared to other stockholders, an issuance of more than 20 percent of our outstanding shares (other than for an acquisition) at a below-market price, or an acquisition of our company by HNA, HNA may vote all of its shares as it chooses. In a third-party tender offer, HNA will be required to tender its shares in excess of 15 percent of our total outstanding shares in the same proportion as shares held by non-HNA holders are tendered.
 For two years after the closing of the Sale, the HNA stockholders agreement requires HNA to not transfer any shares of our common stock that it owns unless: (i) such transfer is approved in advance by a majority of the disinterested members of the board of directors or a duly-authorized committee thereof; (ii) such transfer is to an HNA affiliate, provided that such HNA affiliate agrees to be bound by the terms of the HNA stockholders agreement; such transfer is in connection with an acquisition approved by the board of directors; (iii) such transfer constitutes a tender into a tender or exchange offer commenced by us or any of our affiliates; or (iv) such transfer is in connection with a bona fide mortgage, encumbrance or pledge of capital stock to a financial institution in connection with a bona fide loan or debt transaction or enforcement thereunder. After two years, other than in an underwritten public offering, block trade or permitted transfer described above, HNA will not be permitted to transfer more than 4.9 percent of our total outstanding shares to any person or group, or any shares to certain of our competitors or, to the knowledge of HNA or its broker, a person or group who is a five percent stockholder or who would thereby become a five percent stockholder; in an underwritten public offering or a block trade, other than a permitted transfer described above, HNA will instruct the underwriter or broker not to transfer more than 4.9 percent of our total outstanding shares to any person or group or any shares to a five percent stockholder (unless the identity of the purchaser is not known to the underwriter or broker); and in a block trade, other than a permitted transfer described above, HNA will instruct its broker not to transfer shares to certain of our competitors (unless the identity of the purchaser is not known to HNA or its broker). In addition, if we propose to issue new equity securities for cash in an offering that is not an underwritten public offering or an offering pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, HNA will have a right of first refusal over its pro rata portion of such issuance, measured based on HNA’s ownership percentage (which shall be capped at 25 percent for purposes of the right of first refusal) in us at such time. 
 The HNA stockholders agreement requires HNA and its affiliates not to: (i) acquire, offer or agree to acquire, any beneficial interest in us, subject to certain exceptions; (ii) make any public announcement or public offer with respect to any merger, business combination or other similar transaction involving us (except when our board of directors recommends or approves such transaction); (iii) make or in any way participate in any “solicitation” of “proxies” to vote or seek to influence the voting of securities in a manner inconsistent with our board’s recommendation; (iv) seek election or removal of any director other than HNA designees or otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to control or influence our company; (v) call a meeting of stockholders; (vi) participate in a “group” regarding our equity securities; (vii) act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence our management or policies; (viii) knowingly assist or encourage, or enter into any discussions or agreements with any third party, in connection with any of the foregoing; (ix) publicly disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing; provide any financing for a purchase of our equity securities or assets, subject to certain exceptions; or (x) take any actions that HNA knows or would reasonably be expected to know would require us to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of an acquisition. HNA will not be prohibited from: (a) transferring shares of our stock to HNA affiliates; (b) purchasing shares of our stock pursuant to its right of first refusal over its pro rata portion of newly issued equity securities; (c) making a non-public, confidential acquisition proposal to our board of directors; or (d) after a public announcement of a definitive agreement for the acquisition of our company by a third party, making a publicly announced alternative acquisition proposal for all of our outstanding shares, which, if a tender or exchange offer, must be on the same terms for all such shares and include a non-waivable condition that a majority of the shares held by non-HNA holders are tendered into such offer. To the extent HNA’s ownership percentage falls below 25 percent of our total outstanding shares (or a lower percentage that results from sales of shares by HNA) as a result of issuances by us, HNA may purchase our shares in the open market so as to maintain its ownership percentage at 25 percent (or such lower percentage that results from sales of shares by HNA).
 Blackstone Stockholders Agreement
 19


In connection with the spin-off, we entered into a stockholders agreement with Blackstone, pursuant to which Blackstone was entitled to designate a number of directors that varied depending on its level of ownership of our common stock. These provisions of the Blackstone stockholders’ agreement terminated as a result of the Sale and Blackstone’s other recent sales of substantially all of our common stock that it held. One member of our board of directors, Kenneth A. Caplan, was designated by Blackstone pursuant to the stockholders agreement prior to the sale by Blackstone of the shares of our common stock held by it.
Registration Rights Agreements
 We previously entered into a registration rights agreement with Blackstone that became effective upon the completion of the spin-off. The Blackstone registration rights agreement provided Blackstone with customary “demand” and “piggyback” registration rights. The registration rights agreement also required us to pay certain expenses relating to such registrations and indemnify the registration rights holder against certain liabilities under the Securities Act. As a result of the sale during 2017 by Blackstone of substantially all of our common stock held by it, Blackstone holds only a nominal number of shares of our common stock.
 In connection with the Sale, we also entered into a registration rights agreement with HNA that became effective upon the closing of the Sale. The HNA registration rights agreement provides that, beginning two years after the closing of the Sale, HNA will have customary “demand” and “piggyback” registration rights.
 Tax Stockholders Agreement
 We have entered into a stockholders agreement with Hilton and certain entities affiliated with Blackstone intended to preserve the tax-free status of the distributions in connection with the spin-off (the “Tax Stockholders Agreement”). The Tax Stockholders Agreement provides for certain covenants that may limit issuances or repurchases of our stock in excess of specified percentages, dispositions of our common stock by Blackstone, and transfers of interests in certain Blackstone entities that directly or indirectly own our common stock or the common stock of Hilton or Park. Additionally, the Tax Stockholders Agreement may limit issuances or repurchases of stock by Hilton in excess of specified percentages.
